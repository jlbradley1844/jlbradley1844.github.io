## Chaotic Good Culturs are Inherently Unstable: or, The Problem with Pluralism

There has been something bothering me about this nations intellectual
life that I haven't been able to put my finger on for a while. I think
I've finally figured out what's bothered me.

Part of this is the whole "what caused the last president to be elected"
thing. When someone uniquely unqualified and unsuited to weild power justly
is willingly put into positions of power. The blame, inevitably, is placed
upon those _who warned of the danger_, because you can't blame the backers;
there's simply too many of them. And since many of the people who warned
of the problem were pointy-headed intellectuals, it must be _their_ problem
because they're the only ones who know better.

This line of thinking always struck me as being rather like the lazy
anti-Americanism that many of the people both within and outside of America 
have - because America is powerful, any problem in the world is automatically
seen as either stemming from the actions of individual Americans or, conversely,
the _inaction_ of the Americans. Or, perhaps it's more like the people who
think The President has a button on his desk that can control gas prices,
and if inflation is a problem, it's only a matter of exercising _leadership_.

The fact is, people like to blame other people for their problems. And problems
with the political leadership of any democracy lie within the grasp of one
set of people; the mass of the voters, as well as the "conventional wisdom"
embodied in the culture embraced by those voters. The influence of any 
"elites" might nudge things
by at most one standard deviation.

For example: the civil rights movement started in response to an obvious
evil. This evil was practiced throughout the nation, and it wasn't as if
people were uneducated. "Intellectual elites" (them again) had been railing 
against these conditions for decades. What finally turned things around was
a massive organization involving millions of voters, over more than a
decade of coordinated effort, involving the willing sacrifice of hundreds of
people willing to martyr themselves for the cause, and hundreds of thousands
more willing to put themselves at risk. And this was to rid an _obvious_ evil.
Given this, how much influence do pointy-headed elites really have? Is it
not more likely that they are simply cassandras who are ignored by people
who generally want to ignore them? The truth is, civil rights took the effort
it did because the culture embraced and beloved by the mass of Americans
encompassed a number of deeply racist beliefs and tropes, and only a mass
movement could make the majority rethink their complacency. Indeed, a
large minority still holds those obsolete beliefs dear. It strains credulity
to still think that further resistance is due to elites pushing too hard,
too fast for change.

But there is one problem I think the elites _are_ responsible for. And it
lies not in their intolerance, but rather, in their tolerance and license.

-----------------------

Most Americans, and by extension, most elites are good people. They want to
do good things, ensure that others act good, and generally enjoy the fruits
of a civil society that is, in its essense, good.

American society is deeply individualistic as well. So as part of this perceived
goodness, we seek to limit people as little as possible. Many of the more
liberal members of the elite have embraced _pluralism_ for this reason. Rather
than seek to enforce any moral or political code, it is presumed that the ideal
is to allow a number of different cultures and subcultures, never to elevate
any element over another, and respect all of them. Other than that, say as
little as possible.

The upshot of this is the credo:

    As ye harm none, do what ye will.

If that sounds familiar, it's the Wiccan Rede, comprising the entirety of
the ethics of many of their sects. This is preferred by many over the less savory "Do what
thou wilt shall be the whole of the law," with it's obvious eschewal of
notions of good or evil. Having had acquaintance with wiccans during my
single days (it's been a while), they were generally good people who were
thoughtful in spite of their eschewal of any moral code. And, indeed,
this is probably the entire ethics of current American culture. For most
Americans, particularly those raised in a secular households or nominally
Christian houseold, it's more or less: "Do what you want, as long as
it hurts nobody."

This is particularly the case with secularism - as opposed to atheism. If
you are secular in the sense of not wanting to introduce any religious
preference, this "lowest common denominator" level of morality seems to
allow for all creeds without prefering another one. To my mind, The Golden
Rule ("Do unto others is thou would have them do untu you") also appears 
in all creeds and is more suitable; it's also more morally imperative, which
may be why it's less popular.

I'm going to drag in a bit of terminology from Dungeons and Dragons (tip
of the hat to you Wizards of the Coast fans):

**CHAOTIC GOOD.**

For those of you who spent their childhood being popular or athletically
gifted, you probably have only passing familiarity with Dungeons and
Dragons - perhaps someone in middle school tried to get you interested, or
maybe your dorky big brother had his friends over and babbled nonsense about
spells and rolled the funny dice. One distinctive feature of Dungeons and
Dragons is you were supposed to pick a _moral alignment_ for your character.
Moral alignment was seen as a two-dimensional axis of good versus evil, and
law versus order.

Good and evil was whether your character was good or evil, duh.

Law and chaos were more about your attitude toward order and social authority,
as well as reliability.

So, for example, if you wanted to play the knight-in-shining-armor, you
would tell people your alignment was lawful good, and you loved your church
state and lord, and never oppressed a soul in the least. If you wanted to
player to be a sociopath, you were chaotic evil. Your alignment directed
certain behaviors and abilities; chaotic evil characters could use poison,
for example, but because the other players were likely also chaotic evil, you
could be stabbed in the back at any minute.
Lawful evil was an odd one; it meant you subscribed to a strict moral code
which actually directed you to perform evil. This allowed you to be evil but
somewhat mitigated the "stab behind the back" problem because at least you
had some level of predictability. I rarely saw players pick this
one, but one frequently ran into evil moster cultures of this sort, and in
real life, both Nazi Germany and antebellum American South seemed to be
lawful evil cultures.

Chaotic good, I never saw people pick - or at least, in practice, the player
was either purely good or just extremely unpredictable and capricious, good or not.

So what does this have to do with the discussion at hand?

My assertion is that current secular American culture, the sort idealized
by pluralists on the left and libertarians on the right, and "elites" of
all stripes, is chaotic good. That is:

* The pluralists on the left feel it is insincere to claim to be good
and yet attempt to impose a moral code on other people. Instead, we
must learn to tolerate all values systems, even those we may find
odious. The libertarians on the right feel that any imposition of
a moral code is in itself evil, and an imposition by others. The
lawfulness implied through an accepted moral code is a matter that
must be applied strictly to individuals only, and not through
cultural consensus, and particularly not through governmental laws.

* These same people believe that we should be good because.
That's not a sentence fragment. They think we should be good
_just because_.

The odd thing is that, in general, "just because" seems to do well enough
to keep most people good most of the time. And our society isn't _truly_
chaotic. We have laws in place to protect property rights, punish violence
and restrain the most egregious sorts of fraud. But most people are
still good even in areas where there is an extremely low chance of being
caught. The pluralists note science that shows that homo sapiens are
social animals and basically cooperative; libertarians note that most people
are good because they enjoy "feeling noble"; and since no coercion is
necessary to maintain this state of affairs, there is no need for restrictions
that would wrongly limit people's freedom from action, or limit the ability
of people to associate with subcultures whose values might not mesh with
ours.

Above, I referred to "elites" as passing. I have little tolerance for
the populist anti-elitims - after all, I'm probably an elite by the common
definition. But these are beliefs I rarely hear espoused by ordinary people.
Instead, these are beliefs I hear from intellectuals, or political leaders,
or talking heads on the television, or business leaders or extremely rich 
people, or (particularly) one who is a combination of these things.

And I suppose the chaotic good culture we live in works well enough. But is
it stable?

Well, have you read the news recently?

-----------------------------------

Over the past few years, this regime of extreme individualism coupled
with nominally good civic virtues practice as much out of habit as anything
else has become to be uncoupled. Extreme individualism, in both the commercial
and personal realm has produced a backlash of behavior from the less advantaged
parts of the population, sometimes bordering on violence. This individualism
has also rotted the foundation of civic virtues necessary to sustain a
cooperative culture on a national level. The result has been a trend away
from both chaos and goodness. The reason for this is interesting, partly
because by examining the reasons, we can fix some of the problems that result.

What everyone fears of course, is a descent into a chaotic, evil environment,
one in which justice on any level is unimaginable and amorality is practiced
by the powerful. But to do so, we need to examine just what the causes for instability
is and what needs to change.

One problem is, of course, keeping a chaotic good society chaotic good, rather
than just chaotic. It would be nice if everyone behaved themselves without laws.
But the fact is, some people like individualism, period. You're always going
to have a number of people who are attuned to their own freedoms far more than
they are attuned to their fellow many. You also have people who are unreflective,
callous and selfish. Expecting that people will simply be good "just because" is
a rather silly endeavor. Allowing for extreme individualism means allowing for
all sorts of petty venality to occur without sanction.

Idealists may wish for such societies to maintain goodness through education
or civic virtues. And indeed, well-trained citizens would be far more likely
to carry on properly in civic engagement, as well as having the forberance
necessary to forgive the occasional sins of those who have taken their individual
liberties too far. A population of such people would allow for a just state without
the nagging that causes resentment (warranted or not) at those whose temporary
missteps are seen as improper.

But the only way to get such an educated society is through a modicum
of social order and shared sacrifice by all - something that is unlikely
to happen in a society dedicated to individualism. A chaotic good society is
one that will slowly get less pleasant over time and slowly descend into
pure libertarianism.

There is another problem: there is a large segment of society that will
resent this chaos and libertarianism.

The people in this segment aren't the people you expect. These people may lustily
cheer their libertarian peers, merrily flaunt laws they don't like, and otherwise
express skepticism at attempts to rally their better nature or "nudge" their 
character. You would think such people would enjoy chaos. You would be wrong.
Your typical "barstool libertarian," far from enjoying chaos, is most typically
a lover of order. The order they love simply happens to be one that works for
them.

The problem is the underlying assertion that such people are, in fact, libertarian.
The number of people who are truly libertarian in any sort of consistent manner
in American society is around one percent. Most of the "libertarians" you meet
are, in fact, just little-c conservatives who, for whatever there faults, are
in fact hard-working Americans who really don't expect special favors.
Their libertarianism, more often than not, is just a reflexive reaction of
the society they grew up in - and is, if anything, a desire to conform to
the world view they grew up in and still wish on some level were upheld. The
changes most strongly resisted are frequently those that search to maximize
liberty - you'll be hard-pressed to find any libertarian defenses of transgender
rights or polyamory among such people.

Inevitably, libertarianism, no matter how well-intentioned, is seen by most people
as inviting chaos. Those who critique libertarianism from an economic or ecological
point of view have difficulty standing by while industrializing freebooters despoil
the earth, defraud the naive and use their wealth to control the press. Those who
critique libertarianism from the religious point of view see the elevation of
childlessness by business interests and the libertine as harmful to the maintenance
of society. And those who critique libertanrianism from the commnintarian point 
of view decry the rootlessness that is engendered when companies and cultures
attempt to undercut communities through intentional migration of jobs to other
areas - areas where the people running said companies frequently already own
significant real estate holdings.

At the end of the day, chaotic good's "live and let live" is too often seen
as the imposition of an order that rules out any attempts from people to
defend themselves against those who would misuse liberty for their own ends,
rendering civic virtue as a tool for chumps. Inevitably, a loud clamor for
order of some kind increases. When order does take over, it is rarely good,
as the sudden imposition of order is frequently done at the behest of groups
who wish to use this order to reward themselves and penalize others. The end
result, frequently, is the replacement of chaotic good societies with lawful
evil societies.

-----------------------------

For those in the Baha'i Faith, their goal and their beliefs are clear. They
practice a lawful, good culture, and in spreading the faith, their hope is to
make clear that both lawfulness and goodness are in conformance with happiness of
all. In practice, a culture is going to vary in its adherance to various norms,
and one cannot imagine American culture immediately following under the sway
of the same moral code. And we're not talking about Gilead from _The Handmaid's Tail_;
I'm just talking about uniform adherence to the same codes of conduct in business
and personal life. Indeed, such a culture seems almost un-American.

It's possible the best we could do for America is simply a neutral Good culture;
one where guarantees of justice and fairness may not be as strong as some people
like, but where good behavior is generally rewarded, and obvious evil behavior is punished
and forbidden. I'm not sure that would be so bad. It may not be the paradise some
people want, but perhaps the paradise we can actually get is the
best paradise of all.
