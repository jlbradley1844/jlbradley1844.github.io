# Two Incoherent World Views

It has been written elsewhere that one reason for the Baha'i Faith's
nonpartisan nature is the fact that it is not entirely compatible with
any political party. Indeed, I feel no religion that takes its
independence seriously should align itself with a political party, and
that any alignment between a particular political party and a religion
is temporary in nature anyway, and risks locking a religion into
identifying with extraneous issues due to such drift.

Here in the West, there is another issue having to do with two world
views that are invariably associated with such parties. Both of these world
views, while accepted as commonsense by their own adherence, are
philosophically incoherent. Indeed, the recurrent political crises
that grips are political system is a result of this incoherence.

These two world views are, as you might expect, "the left" and "the
right."

"The left" is a little easier to pick out. It is avowedly
secular. While many of its members are religious, it is an animating
belief that their positions are a matter of logic, without any
relgious element. Matters of good and bad, and likewise matters of
politics, can be settled without recourse to religious thought. This
is due to two underlying beliefs - that people, as a whole, are good,
and that their underlying instincts are good, and that knowledge of
good and bad is a matter of logic.  As a result, "the left" is
generally libertarian in matters of personal conduct, feeling that
man's greater angels will guide his conduct in most matters.

"The right" is the opposite of whatever the left is.

Just kidding (but only sort of).

"The right" may or may not be religious. It does, however, believe
that religion is important and should be defended. The key belief
animating this is that people, as a whole, are bad and
selfish. Religion is important - at least culturally - to overcome
this inclination. Likewise, in matters of private personal conduct, it
is necessary to change conduct and mores slowly, if at all.

So from the above, you can see that "the left" is far more libertarian
in its inclinations, and "the right" is all about regulation - in
personal affairs, in the economy, in environmentalism, the
works. Right?

Funny, that.
