# Why Working on Yourself Is So Much Work

As of this writing, this is New Year's 2018. For many of us, this
means New Year's resolutions. And for many of us, a resolution that
will last a month, or even a week, and forgotten shortly thereafter.

Much has been written about why resolutions fail so frequently - and
why people even make them in the first place. Perhaps the most
frequent resolutions have to do with weight or physical fitness. In
practice, these should be the easiest to keep, if goals are properly
set. This is because at this
stage, we know so much about both. Much has been written about diet
and exercise; both are well known physical processes. Much has also
been written about the psychology of both. Provided one does not
self-sabotage by making the goals too ambitious, success should not be
that difficult. But the opposite is the case, and most will fail at
their resolutions.

So pity the person who, for his or her New Year's resolution, resolves
to "become a better person."

Not only is such a person working against the usual difficulties in
keeping a resolution. This person has a much more difficult issue - a
lack of solid guidance.

One may object to this characterization. One may claim the real fact
is that the goal is ill-posed, and claim "what does better really
mean, anyway." Or one may claim that there exists plenty of guidance
in the form of psychology, religion or what have you. But these
objections themselves have problems.

First, when someone says they want to "become a better person," they
really aren't talking about specific psychological or physical issues
- if they were, then that would be the resolution. In reality, such a
resolution can be stated more clearly as:

    a wish to become a more _virtuous_ person.

Virtue, in this sense, is meant to convey qualities considered
desireable and morally good in people. In this light, this resolution
isn't really an ill-posed resolution. In practice, it's pretty easy to
spell out to other people what is virtuous and what isn't. Those who
claim that there are "no moral universals" are overlooking the fact
that there are _lots_ of moral universals among humans; we are just so
focused on differences that it muddies the waters. Someone making this
resolution isn't talking about arguable differences in morality - things like
definitions of just wars, when abortion is allowable, status of
traditional societies and these sorts of things. They are talkint
about qualities for which there is broad
agreement on what "nice" behavior and "jerk-like" behavior is;
that is what the resolver wants to work on.

Meanwhile, guidance is murky; religious paths, far from presenting a
single path, each provide their own suggested improvements and
denigrate alternatives. Additionally, many religious paths focus on
virtue growth as a side-effect of the religious practice, rather than
its main purpose. In the secular realm, therapy (through a
psychologist) will certainly help - provided one already had a clear
picture of what your defects are and want to change
those. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to know what those
are.

The lack of unity in religions poses a problem here. Once one gets
past the  the particulars of
individual religious, it is easy to see certain outlines of things
being focused on:
* Moral codes of behavior: while these differ vastly between
religions, almost all have some sort of code which interdicts certain
things as being both harmful to the person practicing it and society;
* Forms of prayer or "worship": in particular, the sort of practice
which is intended to induce a more "spiritual" state into the participant;
* Inducement towared meditation or self-reflection. Toward this end,
many religions incorporate lectures intended to inculcate improved behavior.

Unfortunately, as indicated, most religions focus on religious
activity rather than personal improvement. AS such, it is worth
considering if a particular religious path will be sufficient.
Activity in a religious community will certainly keep you
busy and force you to work with others; you will have to do a certain
amount of prayer and reflection. On paper, this should help you. Yet
if one really wanted to improve, increased activity may not be the
solution. If religious activity itself were an indication of moral
worth, the gap between the religiously active, the inactive and the
irrelgious would be obvious to all. Yet the fact remains it is
not. Many of us involved in religious communities can think of
believers who are "inactive" yet who are some of the most virtuous
people we've known.

What, then, is to be done if one has resolved to "be a better person"?
One variant of this, one that is almost certainly a failure, is
something along the lines of

"Try to be a better person."

To quote Yoda, there is no try, only do. Realistically, how would one
do this? Would one suddenly begin to monitor every action one took
throughout the day? If you make this resolution, were you simply not
trying beforehand?

No, if you want to work on virtue, you need to _work on_ virtue. If
you want to work on yourself, it is going to be work.

## A Model for Self-Improvement - Bodybuilding

It is worth asking how people carry out other self-improvements. What do we do in other endeavors? Well, it depends on what you want to
improve:
* If you want to do better at your job, you get training
* If you want to get stronger, you will go to the gym
* If you want to lose weight, you will plan your diet more carefully.

Note what all of these have in common:
- They all take a certain amount of time
- They all involve a certain practice that is repeatedly done
- They all involve learning new habits
- There is a pedagogy (method of learning) associated with each.

So let's pick an example for which a path is clear and reliable -
bodybuilding. Suppsoing someone said:

"My resolution for the year is to improve my physique."

Lucky you - you will be able to do it. I know from personal experence.
The steps are well-defined; it's easy to start, get immediate
feedback; and the pedagogy (teaching methods) is well-researched. If
one's goals are modest and realistic, they _will_ be met. Failure is
generally caused by inability to make time for this; put in the time
and results will follow.

So what are the elements that make this all possible?

1. An easy entry. Workout scripts for beginners are well-known and
fairly standard. For beginners, this usually means a gym
membership. In most cases, this is not cost-prohibitive; and the
modest cost may serve as an inducement to continue one's workouts.

2. Gradual focus on other areas. Initially, the goal is going to be to
simply continue the workouts, but eventually it will be necessary to
branch to more complicated workouts. These may require a modest
increase in time committment. This will also probably be supplimented
by a secondary focus on diet.

3. Eventually, one will begin to focus effort on isolating one's
weaknesses and working on those. A combination of working on isolated
training and overall exercises ensure that weaknessess are addressed
without ignoring the whole.

4. Over time, committments grow in increasing measure and
complexity. One may become dedicated, but if one eases off on one's
committments, the benefits do not disappear.

Note what is happening here. It is easy to get into this habit, with
few decisions to be made for you. Modest results provide feedback that
the right direction is being taken. If there is a plateau in
development, there are several well-known avenues of investigation to
get beyond that. In general, provided guidance is sufficient:

   increased input of effort --> increased output of improvement

Now let's concentrate on "working on oneself." It is completely
unclear where to start. One may find dozens of avenues that promise to
give modest improvement, but on consensus on what that is. It is
impossible to actually see improvement, and therefore impossible to
know when it is necessary to increase one's efforts.

Suppose someone wants to be a "better person." What is the pedagogy
for that? How would one start? How does one see progress? What habits
are likely to help you improve the fastest? Right now, your guess is
as good as mine.

This does not have to be this way. We know a lot about religious
paths. We know about psychology, how to create good habits, and how to
avoid self-defeating cycles. We know about cognitive errors and how to
work around them. We know about moral development. And increasingly,
scientists are investigating the science behind practices such as
meditation. It should be possible to create an analog to physical
training for self-improvement. The question is where to start.

## A Baha'i Model for Self Improvement

Most Baha'is are familiar with the obligations and the practices
written in the Kitab-i-Aqdas and elsewhere. We are accustomed to
seeing these as inseparable from a welter of other parts of the Baha'i
Faith - practices involving administration, teaching, social
endeavors that make the fabric of one's identiy. If someone, not being
a Baha'i or knowing anything about self improvement were to come to us
asking for practices or self-improvement, where would they start? What
would an "initial workout routine" look like?

As a Baha'i there are practices we do every day that could form the
basis of self-improvment. Let's look at some of them:

1. Obligatory prayer

   For the purposes of this examination, the particulars of an
   obligatory prayer are unimportant. Interesting points are as
   follows:
   - The words for all prayers are set.
   - The focus is one one's qualities and relationship to the divine,
   not on "things"
   - Timing is brief; scheduling is of limited flexibility. Shorter
   prayers take place in mid-day, ensuring a break in the one's daily
   schedule.
   - Choice is left to individual, based on preference and perceived
   benefit

2. 95x Repetition of "Greatest Name"

   In spite of the distinctly "Baha'i" nature of the Greatest Name,
   this is distinctly similar to the use of the mantra in oriental
   religions. The only thing setting it apart is the fact that the
   duration is fairly short (no more than a few minutes, far less than
   most meditation sessions).

3. Reading the writings at morning and evening, with a devotional
attitude.

   Here again, there is a need to work in a brief pause for reflection
   into one's schedule.

4. "Bring thyself to account each day..." This injunction from The
Hidden Words is rareley spelled out as an obligation. It is not called
out in either the Kitab-i-Aqdas or its supplimentary texts. However,
this sort of habitual refection certainly seems like an appropriate
addition to one's schedule if one is undertaking any course in
self-improvement.

So, let's look at this. Supposing someone resolved to improve their
own behavior to be a better person and more virtuous. What does the
above regimen give us?

- About 20-30 minutes out of every day
- Creates a number of good habits
- Ensures we focus on our goals for self-improvement repeatedly
throughout the day 

What we have here is a regimen which could serve as an analog for the
introductory physical workout. It's a prescribed course of action. It
requires a time committment but isn't too onerous. It should create an
immediate effect (if only by focusing ones thoughts on self-improvment
throughout the day). I think I've shown that these basic Baha'i
practices could form the foundation of an "initial workout" for virtue
development.

Unfortunately, I've failed to show it actually improves one's virtues!
It's improving something - I just didn't show what yet. Showing that
is for future writings.
