## 2018: My Year in Review

### or, Little Ventured, Less Gained

So it is again time for New Year's resolutions. Last year, in keeping
with my philosophy that the way to become a better person is to
develop better habits, I concentrated on a few:

1. Go to bed 10:15 PM before workdays. While I can't say I was always
good about this, I rarely went to bed much later. What is worse, by
trying this consistently, my sleep clock has moved up, such that by
10:30pm I'm sleepy, and I unfortunately pass out by 11:00pm on the
weekends. So while it was a mixed blessing, it was a successful
resolution.

2. Work out at home Saturday afternoon. I was troubled by the fact I
could usually only fit in two workouts during the week and was never
able to fit in a trip to the gym on the weekend. So I decided to do
this at home, in the basement. This failed spectacularly, as the
basement is a mess. This instead turned into a long basement-cleaning
exercise where by now, the room I would have used for working out has
been emptied and cleaned out in preparation for a full paint job
(!). I have not worked out in the basement once this entire
year. TOTAL FAILURE.

3. Adopt the "virtue routine" as written up in [my prior blog
post](2018-03-11-bahai-virtue-habits.md). I was able to stick to this
one. It was a success in many ways, but not the success I had hoped
for.

First, I've been tracking this, and it "feels like" a habit now. This
is what I usually do. Because I've been tracking it, though, I know
I'm not as good as I think I am! I do it perhaps 60% of the
time. Weekends throw me off, vacations throw me off. This in spite of
the fact that I've set the stage for ideal habit formation: it occurs
the same time and place every night, it replaces some old habits that
I'd been dying to get rid of, and it is self-rewarding. Yet I still
don't consistently do it.

The downside, such as it is, is that in spite of doing this habit,
actual results seen from this habit are hard to come by. Partly this
may be because some of these are Baha'i laws that I'd been practicing
on a more inconsistent basis, and the purpose of the resolution was to
strengthen them and add a few others like a longer period for
meditation. While I feel better afterward, it isn't as if I am
becoming a better person. I can tell from my personal reflection that
I'm probably no less likely to act unfriendly or tense under
stress. I also hoped it would help my swearing; it did for perhaps a
month, but by the end of the year my "swear jar" might have seen a
handful of additions at the end of the day. While I don't practice the
Baha'i Faith with an eye toward productive time use, one would think a
twenty minute investment every day in a new habit would show a bit
more concrete results.

So what does that mean for the 2019 resolution?

Well, I'm not going to give any of these up. Two of them I adopted,
and will keep at it, in spite of the time committment required. And I
really should be able to pick up the third, so in spite of my better
judgment, I'm promising I'll pick that habit up once I finish the basement.

But I do need a habit for 2019. In fact, I'd like to pick two. But
before I do that, a step back to dissect why some habits worked and
others didn't.

- For the habit of getting to sleep at 10:15, that required little
  preparation. I simply had to commit to it over a long term, and did
  not have anything interfering with it. If I had committments that
  made this impractical, such as a resolution to "do X before I went
  to bed" (which I have done befoe!), I doubt I would've accomplished
  this because I would've had to consciously pick whether or not to
  carry out the habit on that particular day.

- For the habit of carrying out a new routine consisting of
  meditation, readings and reflection, I thought about what I was
  going to differently in my schedule. I also had a trigger (that's
  usually just after I put the kids to bed). Finally I thought of
  rewards. At first, I rewarded myself with a half-hour of video games
  afterward but after that started to interfere with my sleep
  resolution, I simply started going straight to bed soon
  afterward. What I found was that after this and some stretching, I
  was able to get to sleep very quickly. That was enough of a reward
  to keep me going.

- For the resolution that failed, I was plainly being unrealistic. I
  knew my workout are downstairs was filty, as was the equipment; I
  told myself it would just take an afternoon to finish up. Instead,
  one year later, I still have not done this, and the weights
  themselves are piled up, waiting for me to complete work on the
  basement.

So for these resolutions, I'll phrase in terms of what I want to have
accomplished, and spend some time thinking about the habits - what
they will be, how to trigger them and what the reward will be. I'll
also revise them around the Baha'i New Year (March 21st this year, I
believe). The two areas I need to improve are to spend more time on
continuous education and to be friendlier and more approachable at
work and elsewhere. A few years ago, I would've stopped right there
and said "well, that's my resolution!" Now with what I know about
habits, I know that's only a starting point and I'm not ready to
seriously carry this out.

-------------

1a. Spend more time on continuous education:
- sign up for classes - the easy part
- CONSIDER: signing up for youtube to get downloads on my computer
- dedicate a half-hour each evening, plus an additional hour every
weekend toward that. Do -not- attempt to do it on the train.
- FOCUS: only attempt to learn one new thing at a time! Don't turn it
into a new-technology yak-shaving exercise.

1b. Continue self-education in philosophy:
- Bring a halt to my reading list research. What I have is good
enough.
- Limit temptation to blog post, particularly for venting.
- Make it possible to read anywhere. Kindle/google books are best, but
so are paperbacks. Ideally, I should be able to take notes the same
time. These notes should be simple for self-review - text files like
this are perfect. They may or may not become cleaned up blog posts.
- FOCUS: eliminate current-reading habits. Perform "assigned reading"
instead of wasting time reading websites.
- PREREQUISITE: Strip down the reading list and form into a
checklist. Start working down the list.

2. Become more approachable:
A few things I need to do
- smile more often
- stop swearing
- "reach out" more often.
All of these require their own habits. I will adopt ONE to do at a
time, spaced out over the year.

ANY PROBLEMS? Well, yes... time and focus. Also

3. Expense review
4. Working out 3 times a week

OK, these aren't really new habits. The expense review will be
one-time over January. And working out 3 times a week is not new, but
for reasons of focus I have to rededicate myself to it.

I'll need to work all of this into my monthly planner.

So for these to become habits:
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Impediments:
- time and focus. Need to ensure I can commit to it. Best way to do
this ensure that if I spend as little as 20 minutes, I can get
something done.
- limit "ceremony." Only do _one_ new thing at a time. If something
seems like a good idea, put it in the planner and do it
_next_. The phrase: "Don't shave that yak yet!"
- too many projects! Focus only on doing the top priority, and timebox
it - spend no more than one month on any given project before moving
on to the next one. A focus of two Baha'i months may be ideal - this
gives 9 full rotations within the year. Avoid using a calendar to plan
far out in the future - that won't work. The goal for the year will be
to explore THREE things fully, so that's just two double-months.
- if doing a class, dedicate self to that class only, and block out
the associated months. Eliminate blockers, such as time spent for
videos. If I have to pay for downloads, pay.
PHILOSOPHY PROJECTS
Keep it simple for this year:
READ 6 BOOKS AND 6 PAPERS AND KEEP NOTES ON THEM.
I'm not trying to write a book yet! Goal is just a "down payment" on
my further studies.

So the associated habits:
- Read philosophy books in kindle or google book. Use
highlighter/notetaking. This will replace current reading habits. I
can do an "outline" blog post but limit time spent editing them.
TRIGGER: bored and need something to read
REWARD: I read it, honestly. If I read for a half-hour, I can then
spend 10 minutes on "garbage" reading (though I have other reading I
should do!)

- For continued education, do the following:
* 2 days to prep a "mini-course" of 2 Baha'i months. Small topics can
be collected into three one-week seminars of reading
* 5 full weeks to carry out said coursework
Plan on a half-hour every weeknight, and 2 hours over weekend during
weekend dropoffs and longer evenings up.
TRIGGER: end of nightly routine (weeknights) OR dropping off kids
REWARD: actually -getting something done for a chance-

Anti-habits to avoid:
- "project-hopping" for professional projects
- "gold-plating" of studies; always picking "the hard problem" as a
stretch goal. Goal is to do well, but finish and move on once I've
learned.
- Wikipedia-spelunking. I've done enough of it for a year! Put away
the references; I have enough reading for 2 years of part-time study.
- picking too much - only pick ONE project at a time, and do that ONE
project. Don't spend time lining up future projects - that is time
wasted.
- Instapaper curation. I probably have too much reading material, and
it will "scroll off" before I can do anything about it.
- Blowing off nightly routine, especially on weekend. This may mean
having to move my routine on the weekend to run the same time that
Martha is in the shower.
- LPs. Need to put them back in the closet. I can get them out in 6
months once I've done something about it.

APPROACHABILITY HABITS
* Smile 5 times a day at other people
* Email at least one person a week
* No swearing
These are mostly "negative" habits. Many of them are about overcoming
grumpiness. So some of the things I need to do are simply refocusing
on good habits:
- Reach out once a week to old list. I did -none- of this last year,
and it is silly.
- Smile and say "hi" at every person I haven't seen within several
hours, unless this is a random "NYC" encounter.
- Short meditations on gratitude at 9:00/1:00/5:00 to lift my
attitude. The 1:00 may include prayer BUT see below
- My meditation needs work. Try doing obligatory prayer for several
months to see if that helps.
- Count swear words to tell how I'm doing at all of this! It should
trend towards zero.
