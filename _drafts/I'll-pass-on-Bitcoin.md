Some time ago I wrote up a blog post about Bitcoin. It was mainly
negative in nature. I saw a few things that seriously concerned me:
1. It was primarily being used as a "buy-and-hold" commodity instead
of a medium of exchange.
2. It was very inefficient as an exchange protocol, having incredible
transaction costs.
3. It was too slow to serve as an efficient mechanism of exchange.
4. The nonrecourse mechanism makes it generally unsuitable for large
transactions, due to the possibility of fraud.
5. The mechanism through with miners are remunerated have the quality
of a pyramid scheme; that is, they are only able to cover costs so
long as each bitcoin is worth increasingly more. Once the "free money"
runs out, miners will have to cover their costs with transaction
fees. Given the computational cost of clearing just one transaction,
these could be more expensive than credit cards.
6. Arguments regarding the upcoming fork represented an existential
threat to the system.
While I haven't seen anything addressing the above issues, and my
outlook is still negative, the market disagrees with me. Tempted as I
am to "go short," I know that I will time it badly, paying a ton for
my puts (if indeed I can even get those) and pull out just before the
thing collapses.

This time, I want to discuss something of more concern - the
proliferation of alternate currencies.

Bitcoin itself is said to be a mechanism of _exchange_ and a _store_
of value. Why is it a store of value? Because - you can use it for
exchange. The need for exchange *is* why you can use it as a store of
value.  In other words, when you buy bitcoin you are paying to "get in
the game." If you don't intend to use bitcoin to exchange it, then
you're just buying it for the privelege of hopefully selling it to
someone else later, and it's the "greater fool" theory (i.e. you're
buying it for what seems to be a foolish price in the hope you can
sell it for an even higher, more foolish price). But if you buy
bitcoin for exchange, then you are getting into it for the service.

Some have said there is no way to value bitcoin. But this is
nonsense. You can value it base on _the value you get by using bitcoin
for exchange instead of something else_. By doing it this way, you can
value it in the standard mathematical models of a hedge; e.g. in
exactly the same approach that options were first calculated using
Black-Scholes, and other financial instruments.

If it's a financial instrument, treat it like a financial instrument!

Someone [link required] involved in etherium warned about the
exploding growth of altchains and nonsense currencies, and indicated
that the present blockchains were suitable and should be standardize
on that. This is humbug, and the worst sort of self-centered
nonsense. Bitcoin was concieved as one of many competing currencies -
competing with "government currency." The reason such people now don't
like these competing currencies is because they are now long major
currencies long. Any alternate currency is competing for cash from
speculators. The hope of those holding bitcoins is that
that network effects will make it *necessary*
for others to purchase the currency that is presently held long by
entities holding very large blocks of currency, and therefore prop up
the price.

However, people should be careful what they wish for. You can make a
few mistakes with these.

Let's look at money. Cold hard cash. To separate the money the
currency from money the value, you must break down the components,
based on what they are worth to you.

Let's look at physical currency. That evil "government paper" the
bitcoiners tell you we should all be rid of. If I have $200 of cash in
my pocket, I would tell you the currency itself is WORTH $203. Why is
that? Here's my breakdown:

$200 - what the money can always be used for
  $3 - what I paid for it at the ATM.

In other words, I have $200 for the underlying "money," but I have
paid an additional $3.00 for the underlying money itself - the
currency, if you will. So the _currency_ part is worth more.

Now, if I tell you this, you might say, "No, the currency part is
worth less, there is a part due to the _convenience_ of you accessing
the currency." In which case, we can both agree that the currency is
worth less than $3.00, but more than, say, a few cents. Given that the
least we can access money from an ATM from is $1.00 (if you can find
an ATM for Actor's Credit Union, I wonder if they still do that), and
those ATMs tend to _draw_ business, we can say the worth of the
currency is typically somewhere in the neighborhood of %0.5-%1.0 of the
money it represents.

So those who _hold_ currency seem to value it at about this level. We
can guage this based on what you might call a "market-driven" analysis
of this concept. Were the value of the currency less than this, nobody
would access their money because of the ATM fees, and  were the value
of currency more than this, people would willingly pay more. To some
extent, this is due to the free proliferation of ATMs. But that in
itself answers the question. If the fees that ATMs charged were seen
as excessive, this would draw more competitors, until there was a sort
of equilibirum. If the fees that ATMs charged were too low, fewer
would be installed, because the lack of aggregate demand would not be
enough to subsidize the ATMs themselves. So ATMs themselves are a good
proxy for value.

You could then say, "NO, this is nonsense. You could conduct your
business in cash! You could have an all-cash household and get paid in
cash totally. So you would you value currency then? There, you've paid
nothing for currency, because CASH IS MONEY, nyah nay!" To which I'd
respond - does anyone actually do that? The answer is no. And why?
It's because when people hold cash, whether they're keeping their
money in a bank and accessing it through an ATM, or keeping it in a
mattress, they must pay for the holding of that currency representing
the money in some way or another. Someone who is holding all cash -
and I mean all of it - has to deal with losses from theft. A more
common case of paying no money was my Dad when I was growing up in the
seventies - he got a paycheck, went to the bank and deposited it, then
got back a set amount of cash. However, he paid for it in by waiting
in line! How much was his time worth? Guess what, you can tell by
looking at... wait for it... ATM fees.

A more common way to get around the ATM fees is to use banks where if
you hold an account, you incur no in-network fees to access
cash. Again, this is easy to justify - the banks are simply leaving
money on the table to lure customers in. If you get a
checking account with a trivial $100 minimum balance, you probably
aren't going to get the free-AMT deal; that's reserved for the
minimum-$5000-balance crowd. You are, in effect, being
subsidized to induce you to leave a lot of cash lying around in the
bank's reserves. So here, the bank is paying for it, in regard to foregone
profits. Obviously they intend another mechanism to capture an
equivalent amount from you in doing so.

So the end result of this analysis? Access to cash is not free - you
pay for it one way or another. A reasonable amount might be %0.5 of
the cash held.

Let's take this a bit further. Suppose you aren't talking the pocket
change that one usually talks about with currency. Suppose you were
nuts enough to have $1,000,000 of cash lying around. Based on the
above valuation, by having it in currency, you also have a "value" of
$5000 due to it being in currency form. Let's step back - does that
seem reasonable?

At first, it does not - it would seem to be _negative_ value. All
other things being equal, having that much currency lying around is a
huge hassle. You have currency controls; you can't just go to the bank
and deposit it, it's incredibly unsafe to leave it anywhere outside of
a safe. Does that mean that in the case of
small amounts currency has positive value, but in large amounts
currency has negative value?

If that's what you're thinking, you've out-thought yourself. If
someone owes you $1,000,000, and they choose to pay it in cash, why
did you choose to take it in cash? Why didn't you
take a bank check like any sane person? Why did the debtor go to the
trouble of emptying out the currency reserves of all the bank
branches? The fact is, when you took $1,000,000, both you and the
seller went to a great deal of inconvenience to make this a cash-only
transaction. Obviously you've
decided that the inconvenience of holding it worth the trouble of
taking it; in other words, it's so unnatural that you must have
decided that taking it as cash is _desireable_. Whether or not you
think having it in currency form is worth $5000, you have clearly paid
for the inconvenience of having it in cash, instead of in a bank where
it can easily be wired around quickly for a small fee.

That gets to another point - the value of currency to a
_seller_. We've already talked about the value of currency to a
holder; that is someone who is going to use currency to buy
things. But there are two sides to any transaction. The seller who
receives money in these exchanges must also be accounted for.

So the buyer derives some sort of benefit from having the
currency. The seller does too - in that the seller can conduct
business. However, the economics for the seller are a bit different.

When you transfer the currency, you are transferring both the money,
and the "additional value" that is captured by having the
currency. This stands to reason, right? So all other things being
equal, since the buyer values the currency and is transferring the
currency to the seller, the seller will also value the currency as
well. And this works to some extent in the marketplace. Many small
business owners are happier working with currency. And you still see a
fair bit of things like gas stations offering lower prices for cash
than credit.

But in general, sellers do not reap the full benefit of dealing in
currency. Why? Well if it's person-to-person (say, buying something in
craigslist), usually it's more convenient and the currency value is directly
transferred to the seller, in the form of "Yay, not only did I sell my
bike, but I don't have to go to the ATM now!" But generally sellers,
do not reap the full convenience. Why? Because they bear the overhead
of dealing with the cash; they have to deal with trips to the bank to
stock different smaller denominations. They are also vunlerable to
theft from the till. In general, unless vendors have a really lousy
deal with credit card companies (like gas stations), it costs them
more to transact business in cash than with credit cards.

Plus there is a cost to society for cash. It costs the government
money to mint and distribute cash. Forget about egregious examples
like the penny, where the goverment pays MORE for the currency than it
is worth - even things like your lowly dollar bill takes a fair amount
of money to mint.

The result is that there is a "deadweight loss" to society when
business is conducted in cash. People derive value from holding cash,
but generally it is lost with the transaction. In the case of credit
and debit card transfers, some of this is captured with transaction
fees, but there is a deadweight loss to the credit card companies in
the cost of running their own business, as those networks aren't free.

So why is a currency of value, then? A good currency is one that does
two things: 
* For the buyer and seller, it helps ease transactions by lowering the
transaction cost.
* For the marketplace as a whole, it is structured to lower the
deadweight costs for the maintenance of the currency in the marketplace.

So this is how a currency is good. And the better a currency is at
doing these things, the more valuable it is, and the more people will
use it for their transactions.

So why should people hold bitcoins _as currency_? Because by holding
bitcoins, it allows someone to conduct business *more cheaply* and
with a *lower deadweight cost* to the marketplace as a whole.

There is one additional consideration that have not yet introduced,
but that must be considered. Were you to hold $1,000,000, you would
expose yourself to currency risk. What is currency risk?  That is the
change in value you incur due to changes in the value of money
itself. Now, in our discussion above regarding ATMs, this is sort of
mooted, as we are comparing money in hand versus money in a bank
account,and both are equally impacted by any changes in money due to
inflation or other thigs. But still, there is a big difference - if
you hold the money in a bank, you have a lot more leeway to invest
your funds rather than hold it in cash. If you save $1,000,000 in
currency, you're stuck. Your currency will tend to lose value over
time, since you are not able to invest it (if you did invest it, you
would no longer have the currency, would you?). But at least you know
which way things will go, roughly. If you hold it for a month or two,
you should be okay, and since you use currency _for exchange_ (e.g. to
give someone else), that should nto be an issue.

Bitcoins, on the other hand, are far more volatile. As such, we have
to take into account the volatility of this. When we hold bitcoins as
currency, we intend to use it for transactions. There are two sorts of
transactions involved:
1. Dollar denominated (or other traditional currency) and
2. Bitcoin denominated
In the case of dollar denominated translation, you wind up having
currency-related risk; essentially, you are buying a forward on the
currency when you convert your dollars to bitcoins to make the
transaction. Why? Because you will not be able to transact
instantaneously - you will have to
1. Convert your dollars to bitcoins
2. Make the purchase
3. And the seller must convert bitcoins back to dollars.
If you hold bitcoins in a wallet long-term, then you can amortize step
1 over a large number of transactions, but steps 2 and 3 must be
carried out in any case. However, at that point you are explicitly
investing your little wallet, with whatever that entails.

Bitcoin-denominated transactions are pretty darn rare - usually when
you see a price in bitcoins, it is pegged to a denomination like
dollars behind-the-scenes. The currency risk to the seller is too
great. A rapid run-up in the value of BTC will cause the seller's
prices to quickly become uncompetitive; a rapid fall in BTC will
suddenly expose sellers to selling at prices in which they cannot
possibly cover their costs.

So based purely on this mathematical analysis, we know the following:
* People value currency, in and of itself, beyond the money it
represents. Currency is valued because it enables transactions of a
certain sort.
* Currencies derive their value from two things - their ability to
carry out transactions cheaply, and their ability to facilitate an
efficient marketplace for goods and services by minimizing "deadweight
loss" from the overhead in maintaining that marker.

The question, therefore, is how highly valued various electronic
currencies should be. I presumed based on a sort of "strong market
theory" that money, at least in small denominations, is valued at
a 0.5-1.0% premium of the face value of the cash itself, based on what
people are willing to pay in ATM fees.

Bitcoin derives (or at least, shoud derive) its value from the demand
people would have to carry out transactions in BTC as opposed to
dollars. For it to be competitive, it would need to

Let's play  a game.  Suppose there  are 1  million bitcoin  total, and
99.9% bitcoin is held by three large entities, each capturing 33.3% of
the bitcoin.  The other  0.1% is held  by numerous  "small investors."
The small investors as a collective have only 1000 bitcoins, and the
price of each bitcoin has itself been bid up to $1000, bringing the
total capitalization of the 3 entities to 333 million dollars. Note
that the pool of bitcoin in circulation is miniscule - merely $1
million - yet because of large blocks of uncirculating bitcoin, it
