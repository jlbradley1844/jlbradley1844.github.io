#I Know HackerRank Stinks. Here's Why I Use It

Are you a software engineer? You'll have to deal with something. If,
indeed, you haven't dealt with it dozens of times already. The
technical phone screen - if not using a tool called HackerRank, then
some other whiteboarding program.

It's almost insulting. You've spent years on your education, probably
additional more years in your chosen profession. You have a resume
packed with accomplishments. But in the first phone screen, the
interviewer doesn't ask you a think about that. Instead, you're asked
to solve simple programming questions for upwards of an hour - almost
an insult to your intelligence.

Other writers have complained about how unnatural and unfair this sort
of thing is. The venerable (wisdom-wise, not age-wise) DHH of
Ruby-on-Rails fame has compared this 
to "scrimmaging" - the sort of drills that atheletic recruiters do
that are used to compare between candidates that are notorous for
overlooking great players and overrating atheleticism that never adds
up to anything on the field. Obviously, sitting down and coding
something is a tiny part of what we do, and ugly problems involving
tree traversals and string manipulation an even smaller part. It
would _seem_ that a good phone interview would concentrate on the
bigger picture of you as an engineer. The mass use of tools like
HackerRank as a screening mechanism would seem to be nothing more than
herd mentality thought among engineers.

Yet I, as an interviewer, use HackerRank. And I insist on continuing to do
it.

Why, you may ask?

If you're a little younger, listen up. It explains why I, and
virtually all other older engineers, do this. And may help you get
past that first phone screen. And if you are a more senior engineer
who does phone screens, about what to look for and what sort of things
to let slide.

================================

First of all, this is a phone *screen*. When I do a phone screen, I am
not conducting a real "interview." Yes, you a candidate, have gotten
your resume on my desk and through HR (congratulations!) and I'm
inclined to give you a shot for that very reason. But I have to ensure
that if I bring you into the office, I do not waste *your* time, and
you do not waste *my* time.

A phone screen is an _interview for an interview_.
In other words, if I bring you in, are you going to wash out
immediately and embarass me for bringing you in?

To this end, I need to find out:
1. Can this guy/gal code his way out of a wet paper bag, and
2. Did he/she really mean to apply for *this* job (as opposed to *a* job).

People screw up interviews for all sorts of reasons. They may be a bad
fit for the job. They might be fibbing to themselves about whether
they have the skills for a job. They might present themselves
poorly. They might have character issues. But in all honesty, those
are idiosyncratic things. If someone has these sorts of problems, they
don't show up on a phone screen - it takes several people carefully
interviewing the person. Which is precisely what an in-person
interview is. If you have one of these problems, you could still be
here for several hours.

However, there are a lot where after one or two sessions, everyone
is an overwhelming thumbs-down. This almost always happens for a given
sort of candidate:

- The candidate is an unskilled hands-on coder. He cannot write a
  simple program in the language he claims to have expertise in.
- The candidate is a poor communicator. Not in the sense of having an
  accent, but in the sense of not understood what is being asked,
  solving the wrong problem in spite of repeated clarifications.

If you get bring in a dozen candidates and half of them wash out for
the same exact reason, it seems evident the way to fix this is to
screen them for exactly those sorts of flaws.

We got exhausted by the number of unqualified candidates who sailed
through perfunctory HR screenings and technical bull sessions on the
phone but turned out totally qualified when we flew them in to
interview. And it was no mystery how to weed them out: walking through some
beginner-intermediate-level coding exercises on the phone, explaining
as we go, and see if they actually knew what they were doing.

-----------------

In our defense, a lot of the current interviewing practices that are
recommended by others in the industry are well-intentioned, but
borderline abusive. I won't sign off of them, not just because they
don't work, but they're ridiculously onerous.
* Portfolios/GitHub accounts: We presume you have day jobs and would
prefer to channel your energies into that. Expecting someone to be
able to show off a portfolio is ridiculous. We don't expect it, and
it's ridiculous to think someone can put together something they can
be proud of in just a few hours. Even for college candidates, we don't
do this. (Also, advice to college candidates: In a career where I've
reviewed hundreds of resumes, I've only see one portfolio that didn't
embarass its owner. If your GitHub account consists of nothing but
broken toy apps and Ruby boilerplate, feel free to leave it off your
resume.)
* "Take Home" time-limited assignments. This sounds good but is
a good one given in the context of asking for HOURS of a candidates time,
unless you've given an already-solved CS problem, in which case you're
asking candidates to reinvent the wheel and giveing a leg up to
plaigarists.
Also, we do not conduct in-person interviews this way. Do not expect
more of the same - you will get design questions and behavioral
questions and the sort of fun stuff you expect in an interview. But
you will still be expected to code!!

Now, if you're insulted by these sorts of things, please don't grit
your teeth, and please know that you're not alone. If you ace the
interview, you ace the interview. Don't begrudge us your loss of time
- we aren't going to bring you in multiple times. Indeed, the whole point of
doing this is so we only have to bring you in once ensure and when we say
"yes," we mean it. Put it this way - do
you want to work at a company where management hires anyone who can
fill a chair and where you'll have to carry the water for incompetent
workers? If not, you'll have to reconcile yourself to the fact that we
need to make sure only good people get into the door at this
company. Rather than consider this a waste of time, consider this an
investment in towards purchasing competent co-workers.

However, I must confess. The process isn't flawless. That's why I'm
giving out some free advice.

I've seen a pretty fair number of candidates
that look great on paper that that did horribly in coding
interviews. I'm sure some of them had faked a good part of their
resume - or at least fudged it to make themselves look far more
central to their teams' successes than they really were. And in that
case, when they wipe out in a phone screen, it's a bullet dodged for
me. On the other hand, there were a few who did quite badly, in spite
of the fact that when I dig into their background, they seemed to know
what they were talking about.

In that case, I many times still have to take a pass. I can see how
this happens; if you gests to a senior-enough level, you will spend
all your time reviewing code, and when you do code, you surround
yourself with tooling. And such candidates could easily be  caught
flat-footed in a whiteboard 
coding environment, especially if it's the first time you've done this
in several years (or ever). I know - the same thing happened to me
when I did my in-person at Google and had to write code on a
whiteboard. But the fact I made that mistake myself doesn't change my
position; I still have to pass. You may be hot stuff, but if you do not
_demonstrate_ this fact over the phone, I cannot assume you won't wash
out when you get in. I cannot decide, based on a poor performance,
that I can still somehow "intuit" that someone is really being
truthful with their resume and are merely having a bad day. I have to
be fair to my team members and other candidates, and force myself to
say no.

SO IF YOU ARE A CANDIDATE: this may not be fun, but you owe it to your
interviewers to meet them halfway. Please do at least a minimum to show that
you can _demonstrate_ your skills in a phone screen. This doesn't
require a lot, but it does require some investment in time:

1. Get used to coding in a minimal whiteboard-type environment.

2. Familiarize yourself with common problem types.

That's it!

For #1 I recommend you get an account on hackerrank or one of the more
common "groupware" programming environments. (Unfortunately, you don't
get to pick, so I don't mean Visual Studio Online.) If you've been
pushed into common senior engineer roles where you spend much more
time reviewing code and doing API-wrangling than doing mainline work,
you may be much rustier than you realize! The good news is that a few
hours in one of these environments will have you *much* more
comfortable in one of thewe whiteboarding situations.

For #2, pick up some problems online and do them. Books like _Cracking
the Coding Interview_ lean far too heavily on this sort of thing and
may be overkill; likewise, stuff like the ACM Programming Contests are
lots of fun. But the stuff I ask on phone interviews (and that most
people ask) are more basic in nature, and a few hours reading
algorithm books will help. We also tend to ask questions drawn from
real-life programming challenges we face, so if you're making a move
within the same industry, review that sort of stuff - you may get you
through the phone screen.

A few hours for a few weekends, and that's it!

Well, I lied, one more thing:

3. Be _selective_ about the jobs you apply to.

Didn't expect that, did
you? Well, I didn't harp on it, but there are a lot of people who seem
inclined to take an interview, any interview, for practice or
backup. But we don't want to waste our time; do you want to waste
yours? If you really want to do data science and your resume is
geared toward data sciense and all you talk about is data science,
the by all means apply to *those* jobs.
Don't apply to a devops position and try to get someone to fit the job
to your resume. We won't fly in a candidate who has given every
indication that he is "just browsing."

While I realize this seems like "one more thing to do," it's far
better to spend a few hours making sure you can get through simple
phone screens than it is to spend several more hours talking to even
more recruiters.
