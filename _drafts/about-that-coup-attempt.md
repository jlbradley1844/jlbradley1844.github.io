## About that "coup attempt"...

It's been nearly a month since the nastiest day in American civic life in a
long time. January 6, 2021, a day when a motley crew of anti-government folk,
white surpremacists, Q-anon folk and other assorted nutters carried out an
unexpectedly successful assault on our nations Capital building, abetted by
law enforcement officials who were either unprepared or latently sympathetic
and a supportive Executive unwilling to direct additional forces to thwart it. Much
has been written about the root cause of this event.

I've read several such articles and I see very few people that seem to have
put their finger on the cause. It is the same cause as that which gave us
the costly War on Terror of the past twenty years.

The root cause of this is **religious fanaticism**.

For many students of history, the events of January 6 are distressingly
familiar, but most of the analysis presume political or civic motigations.
And none have tied this to September 11 attacks of 20 years ago. However, a bit
of thought will show that far from this being some new horrid development,
civic disorder and violence due to fanaticism has been a constant 
throughout American culture,

There are plenty of videos of the January 6 crowd, and alongside the polical
signage was a lot of explicitly Christian religious signage.
And no wonder. There are many prominent clergypeople who fully endorsed the
march on the Capital. Some asserted, in spite of no evidence, that there
were unnumbered acts of fraud during voting. Others preachers have gone as far
as claiming that it was God's Will that such an overthrow take place, a bloodletting
as a condign punishment to lawmakers who would not instill laws and politicians to 
their linking.

Few Americans want to say the cause is *Christian* fanaticism.
In a nation where most citizens are
at least nominally Christian, many are uncomfortable labeling their fellow
belivers as fanatics. The stereotypical American image of a
religious fanatic is an Other - a heavily veiled muslim
with a bomb, or fundamentalists in odd outfits who refuse to wear
masks in a pandemic or vaccinate their children. It isn't someone who goes to the
same church your religious brother-in-law goes to.

The weak defense of this by many believers is that the Christian church is somehow
"under siege." Consider the following stressors on many Christian denominations:

* The increasing secularization of society, particularly in geographies of
  higher wealth, leading to a slow depopulation of less developed locations
  favored by such believers.

* The slow inexorable movement of young people away from religion - particularly
  those associated with the more strict, limiting variants.

* A public press unafraid to cast opprobrium on religious leaders for various
  reasons, be it for the sexual abuse scandals involving minors, fiscal malfeasance
  involving the use of funds, or the persistent cultural and racial segregation
  of established congregations.

* The onward march of science, leading to certain long cherished beliefs and
  laws being exposed to ridicule before the masses. This is particularly true for
  beliefs that hold the modern medical professions in ill regard, or claim a
  natural history that defies all established knowledge of geography and biology.

* A prevelance of small, underfunded, financially stressed churches, where
  it is a challenge to keep the lights on, depriving them of the ability to
  carry out works of service that is Jesus' truest witness.

These stresses are nothing new, and the traditional responses have always been
that of evangelism - spreading the Gospel to new believers who will carry on
the tradition. Indeed, that has always played to its core strength - the message
of Jesus Himself. Older, wiser believers with a sense of perspective could
rightly look at these struggles and think, at some level, that this is the
Same as It Ever Was.

However, either due to the current loss in receptivity, or outright frustration,
there has been a shift in many quarters
away from evangelism and instead toward seizure of secular powers in political
institutions, even by force or violence if required.
While this may seem novel and disturbing in America, it is easily recognizeable
to students of history, who will recognize in this the roots of religious violence
everywhere.

There has been much attention to so-called Christian Nationalism, about the
danger this particular strain poses to the American Christian community. Not being a
Christian, anything I have to offer on the subject is going to be inferior to
what other faithful Christians already have to say on the subject. This particular
strain of fanaticism will either be solved by Christian leadership, or wont; if it won't,
then the dominant strain of American christianity will flounder and perish,
as it slowly loses its most capable and sincere believers, who have alwasy been
more drawn to the message
of Jesus than the particular cultural beliefs associated with American White 
Christianity. Either way, the problem will be solved.

However, fanaticism is always with us, and there are many things we can discuss
about it without getting lost over the particular causes and pathologies of the
present day.
The Baha'i Faith has much to say about fanaticism, its causes and solutions. And that's
what I hope to focus this column on.

### Fanaticism: the Baha'i Perspective

As a Baha'i, we are repeatedly reminded of the dangers of fanaticism,
and particularly religious fanaticism:

    Religious fanaticism and hatred are a world-devouring fire, whose
    violence none can quench.

	(Baha'u'llah, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 14)

    In matters of religion every form of fanaticism, hatred,
    dissension and strife is strictly forbidden.

	(Baha'u'llah, Tabernacle of Unity)

    A new religious principle is that prejudice and fanaticism whether
    sectarian, denominational, patriotic or political are destructive
    to the foundation of human solidarity; therefore man should
    release himself from such bonds in order that the oneness of the
    world of humanity may become manifest.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Baha'i World Faith - Abdu'l-Baha Section, p. 247)

    Schools must first train the children in the principles of
    religion... but this in such a measure
    that it may not injure the children by resulting in ignorant
    fanaticism and bigotry.

	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 68)

Baha'i writings frequently decry fanaticism, and the early clerical
opponents of the Baha'i Faith are frequently labeled as fanatics; so
much so, that one of a skeptical mindset is tempted to think the
reason Baha'is described their clerical opponents as fanatical is
because they were opponents of the Baha'i Faith. That is not the
case. There were a *lot* of opponents of the Baha'i Faith during its
development, and only certain opponents were described as
fanatical. In this case, the opponents of the Baha'i Faith who held
power in the clergy *were* fanatical by any fair description;
obscurantist, anti-science, superstitious and anti-Western (that is,
in opposition to European enlightenment philosophies, of which the noble
class in Persia was actually both aware and fearful). To be a clergy was no
disqualification from following the Baha'i Faith; indeed, many of the
first followers of the Babi and Baha'i Faiths were themselves
clergymen or serious students of Islam.

The condemnation of fanaticism is not simply about events of the past;
contemporary Baha'i authorities contine to draw attention to it as a
problem:

    The resurgence of fanatical religious fervour occurring in many
    lands cannot be regarded as more than a dying convulsion. The very
    nature of the violent and disruptive phenomena associated with it
    testifies to the spiritual bankruptcy it represents. Indeed, one
    of the strangest and saddest features of the current outbreak of
    religious fanaticism is the extent to which, in each case, it is
    undermining not only the spiritual values which are conducive to
    the unity of mankind but also those unique moral victories won by
    the particular religion it purports to serve.

	(The Universal House of Justice, Messages 1963 to 1986, p. 685)

The main harm it does is to the cause of religion itself, unfortunately:

    Tragically, organized religion, whose very reason for being
    entails service to the cause of brotherhood and peace, behaves all
    too frequently as one of the most formidable obstacles in the
    path; to cite a particular painful fact, it has long lent its
    credibility to fanaticism. We feel a responsibility, as the
    governing council of one of the world religions, to urge earnest
    consideration of the challenge this poses for religious
    leadership.

	(The Universal House of Justice, 2002 April, To the World's
	Religious Leaders, p. 1)

So is fanaticism limited to just terrorists and the oddball relative
whose guns we occasionally have to hide? If it were, it seems unlikely
that it would get this amount of attention by the writings. 

### So What IS a Religious Fanatic, Anyway?

The writings themselves give a clue to exactly what is meant when
fanaticism is referred to. When we search the Baha'i writings, what
words come up in associated with fanaticism?

* bigotry
* hatred
* strife
* ignorant and blind
* unreasoning
* foolish and mindless
* prejudice

Elsewhere in the writings, fanaticism is associated with superstition
and unscientific attitudes. All of the above paints a very
specific picture of a fanatic - namely, the  prideful, intolerant,
authoritarian leaders and followers one usually find in extreme
religious causes, cultural movements, and movements of "ethnic
purity". As much as you may dislike the benighted followers of
flat-earth movements and anti-vaxxers, these do not fall into this
category of fanaticism. Instead, one is more likely to find this in
the more extreme wings of well-accepted cultural movements. By its
very nature, when it hides inside accepted institutions, it is hard to
see it as a problem; those who do see it as a problem tend to blame
the movement itself, rather than the fanaticism which damages the
movement.

The question is what to do about it.

First, I'd like to discuss a popular explanation; it has a grain of
truth, but I'd like to examine it further.
I suspect modern psychologists would explain fanaticism as an
unhelathy coping mechanism for something called "cognitive
dissonance." Cognitive dissonance is the discomfort you feel when you
have to reconcile two beliefs that are in seeming opposition to one
another. You, gentle reader, being a psychologically healthy
individual, would react to congnitive
dissonance by re-examining the conflicting beliefs; perhaps you may
discard one belief, judging it to be erroneous, but more likely you'll
modify both beliefs so that they come in agreement with one another. Thinking
religious people do it all the time, but this isn't just a religous
process. Scients do it as well; they frequently have their own favorite pet
theories, but the best of them are quick to modify or discard theories
when presented with enough evidence to the contrary. (Of course, that
doesn't always happen; hence the saying "Science progresses one
funeral at a time.")

In someone who is not psychologically healthy, cognitive dissonance is
instead resolved by seeking to eliminate the _source_ of this
dissonance; a nonbelieving relative, scientific authorities, members
of different cultures, unflattering media. Anything that does not
conform to their own cherished beliefs are rejected, ensuring that
cognitive dissonance is never experienced.

But that doesn't fully explain the sort of fanaticism condemned in the
Baha'i writings. Someone could be excessive fearful and credulous by
their very nature. Is fanaticism really blameworthy for such people?
The answer is, it depends upon what one does with one's fanatical
world view. The fanatical behaviors described in the Baha'i are those
that insist on controlling one's environment, those close to them,
even to the society as a whole. This is no longer just an excessively
fearful reaction; what fanatics really suffer from is excessive pride.

    The fact that we imagine ourselves to be right and everybody else
    wrong is the greatest of all obstacles in the path towards unity,

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Paris Talks, p. 135)

    Fighting, and the employment of force, even for the right cause,
    will not bring about good results.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Abdu'l-Baha in London, p. 91)

    The unbelievers and the faithless have set their minds on four
    things: first, the shedding of blood; second, the burning of
    books; third, the shunning of the followers of other religions;
    fourth, the extermination of other communities and groups.

	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 91)

So how to treat this problem?

Baha'u'llah's first order of business
what to ensure that _his own believers did not themselves become
fanatics_. While many of his early writings invoke martyrdom as a
token of sacrifice - in keeping with its background in Shi'i Islam
beliefs - they are meant as figurative and are no excuse for descent
into fanaticism and intolerance. While the writings themselves are
replete with calls for fidelity in the faith and sacrifice, such can
never be forced on anyone but oneself.

    In this Day, We can neither approve the conduct of the fearful
    that seeketh to dissemble his faith, nor sanction the behavior of
    the avowed believer that clamorously asserteth his allegiance to
    this Cause. Both should observe the dictates of wisdom

	(Baha'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 343)

    Some heedless souls roam the lands in the name of God, actively
    engaged in ruining His Cause, and call it promoting and teaching
    the Word of God...

	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 58)

    The Lord of celestial wisdom saith: A harsh word is even as a
    sword thrust; a gentle word as milk. The latter leadeth the
    children of men unto knowledge and conferreth upon them tree
    distinction.

	(Baha'u'llah, Tabernacle of Unity)

In fact, there are actual religious laws from the Baha'i central figure,
Baha'u'llah himself,
which forbids behaviors and lifestyles that can cultivate fanaticism:
priesthood, monastacism, ascetism, and forcing one's interpretation of
the Holy Writings on others. He also forbade his believers to enage in
contention and conflict of any sort, let alone about questions of
personal belief.  Likewise, he urged his followers to consort with
followers of all religions, instead of isolating themselves into their
own sub-communities. Other particular laws of note:

* The burning of books is forbidden.
* In sickness, competent physicians shall be consulted with.
* Universal education for all is an obligation for families and
societies, particularly in literacy, conduct and "the
useful arts" (i.e. sciences).
* It upholds the authority of science and "the learned" in matters of
the natural world.

Before closing this topic, I need to clarify that these laws are
written only for the Baha'is themselves. They were not written so that
Baha'is could force this upon other people (much as friends of the
Baha'i Faith may wish they were). It was for Baha'is by the founders,
to insist on proper conduct and attitudes from those that claimed to
follow the Faith.

So this takes care of the less than %0.1 percent of the world
population that are Baha'i. Are there solutions for everyone else?

### So Are There Solutions?

Before I start, a caveat: there is something I've found through study,
experience, and mostly The Hard Way. The Baha'i Faith is for yourself.
It is not for Other People. By that I mean that the laws and guidance
given in Baha'i writings are intended for those that accept them when
they encounter them; it is not something to be forced on others, even
if it be for the benefit of all mankind.

So the most important key is to avoid fanaticism in your own action.
This is where your responsibility lies.

We can extract several helpful directions from Baha'i laws and writing:

* Not accepting the beliefs of others as your own in an uncritical
fashion;
* Educating oneself, and one's children, with the ability to think
critically about society's messages;
* Avoiding entanglement in activities of an explicitly partisan nature,
particularly set against a cultural or religous Other which is cast
as The Enemy;
* Relying only on sources of information of known trustworthiness and 
accuracy;
* Favoring the opinion of experts educated on the subjects of which
they speak;
* Avoiding gossiping and backbiting, whether among friends or in the
consumption of media;
* Skeptically weighing the testimony of those whose writings are designed
to inflame passion, rather than inform.

That guidance doesn't sound particularly religious, does it? Yet all of
them are related to guidance from the Baha'i writings.

That being said, we are not otherwise passive observers within society.
With receiving this guidance, we accept the duty to teach others about
it, and the duty to live our civic life in accordance with that. We can
otherwise fight fanaticism in our lives in these manners.
