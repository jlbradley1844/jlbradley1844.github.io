## About That Low US Birth Rate...

Should some future digital archaeologist come across this blog (as it
is unlikely anyone else would), they would notice there has been a
long gap since the last post. Partly this is because I wrote these blogs
during the commute, and I've been doing a lot less of that recently. But
another reason is fewer new things to write - not because I haven't 
had things, but things I haven't _already_ written about. People
complaining about "cancel culture" who really only seem to be concerned
about protecting racist speech? I already did that. The coup/uprising
against election results on January 6 as an outgrowth of religious
fanaticism? That too. I only let myself vent once.

But there is one subject that has bothered me. It is about the
discussions around the current hand-wringing over low US birth rates.

I actually think this is a problem - not because of demographic
concerns, but over what it means in society. The Baha'i Faith
recommends marriage and child-rearing for all. This isn't required
by any means - there are plenty of examples of early Baha'i heroes
and heroines who chose to forgo marriage for one reason or another.
But the implication is that marriage and child-rearing are normative.
In addition to this, this is widely regarded as desireable by
most Americans _already_. 

There have been recent surveys of American women
on the number of children they wish to have, and the answers are
uniform - between 2.3 and 2.6. While it is impractical to assume
that everyone will be able to have as many children as they want,
the fact that US birth rate is below replacement indicates a lot
of women are unable to have the families they wish.

And it isn't as if we don't know the reasons, either. There have
been surveys of these same women to determine why they can't have
as many children as they want. And here too, the reasons are
remarkably consistent:

* Financial considerations;
* Getting married too late;
* Difficulty finding a suitable marriage partner.

Note that I'm only talking about _women_ here. While men may have
concerns, when it comes to family size, it is women who have the
children, and they are the determining factor.

There are those who insist this is not a problem - or rather, is
not a problem for _themselves_. They do not wish to marry or have
children (or perhaps, _not now_). But aside from demographic concerns,
there is the more pressing concern that most people _want_ children,
and a society that does not allow family formation is simply going
to be an unhappy society.

If I were happy with the tenor of discussions around this, I would
remain silent. But there are a few substantial omissions in
discourse.

One rather reasonable point of view is that it is simply _too
costly_ to have children - or at least, a large family that one
might desire. To this end, they argue for social programs to assist
help defray expensive such as childcare. Whatever one may think of 
this approach, the main
problem I think everyone can agree on is _cost_. Subsidizing child
care is needed by many becuase it _is expensive_. Shifting this
burden to local or national goverments will not make it any less
expensive. While I personally think it's worth the expense, many
will disagree. A more important point is that this has already been
tried in other contries - with success! - but it still does
not raise birth rates by more than a few tenths of a point. France's
generous benefits have allowed it to be practically the only country
in Europe with a birth rate above the replacement rate, but at
a cost of several hundreds of thousands of dollars per child over
the benefit lifetimes. Those who think this inefficient often
counteroffer benefits such as tax reductions; however, these sorts
of proposals have had little effect when offered. This is
almost certainly because the benefits
are meager compared to actual childrering costs as to have no 
practical effect on one's ability to raise additional children.

Because of these problems, those who wish a solution that does
not ~~raise their taxes~~ increase the cost to society have mostly
laid blame at the culture of society. In this fact, I think most
Baha'is would be in agreement of the root cause. But may of the 
more traditional "solutions" are either misdirected or wrongheaded.

Much of the discussion around birth rates around traditionalists is
explicity focused on numbers - increasing the number of women who
have children and the number of children in the families of women
who are *already* married. Much of their approach has been laughably
unserious. The most popular approach, used by clergy the world around,
has been to simply browbeat married women of childbearing years
into having more chlidren than they want. Or perhaps press women
unready for marriage and childrearing into doing so. Far from causing
a baby boom, such advice merely confirms to the listener that the
advice is being given for the benefit of the speaker, not the recipient.
In spite of this, many politicians echo this approach, adding loud
caveats that they mean for this to apply to good solid christian
families _only_ - all the while complaining out of the other side
of their mouth about single mothers of a certain ethnicities breeding
uncontrollably.

There are a handful of traditionalists I read and respect, without
necessarily agreeing with (e.g. Ross Douthat). They rarely make this
mistake. They also zero in on the cultural impediments that keeps
birthrates low. Unfortunately, the cultural impediments zeroed in
are usually the wrong ones, usually around denigration of "traditional
families." It is true that if every woman were pressed into serving
their "traditional roles" as childrearers in single-income families,
there would be more time for childrearing. If you pressed homosexual
men to marry "beards" and have children for appearences sake, there would
be more children. There would likewise be more children if we had
strict zero-abortion policies and forced all women to carry unplanned
pregnancies to term. Indeed, some traditionalists who don't mind getting
laughed at still rail against birth control.
The result of all of these changes would be more babies, at the cost of
more unhappiness, all the while doing nothing to assist those women
who wish to have children and cannot. Traditionalists would no doubt
say that I am attacking a straw-man - they never proposed forcing
homosexuals to marry, or forcing women out of the workforce, or reviving
discredited Comstock laws. Yet given
the preferred villians they claim are forcing down birthrates - women
in the workforce, homosexuals, abortion and sex without pregnancy - it 
is hard to conclude
otherwise.

I don't have an answer to this, and I don't pretend to. What I can say,
however, is it seems that much of the discusson around childrearing seems
aimed toward forcing the implementation of policies that people very
much want for entirely different reasons other than increasing
birth rate.

Rather than use this as an excuse to push my pet policies, let's actually
look at these impediments.

* Financial considerations

Many of the traditionalists look back to the fifties and sixties as a
Golden Era of American Families. Unfortunately, they seem to avoid
considering the economic environment in which it happened.
In the fifties and sixties in mid-America, on a single blue-collar salary
requiring only a high school degree and a bit of trade school, it was 
possible to afford:

* A very modest house
* Food for the family and
* Medical insurance

This wasn't true for everyone - you had to be white and be suitably located
to pull this off, but the fact remained that the average marriage age was
very low by modern standards (mid-twenties) and a lot of people were
having children because they could have children. This is a dramatic contract
to the present situation, where the bulk of young people have no way of
meeting even these modest requirements, so either consider themselves
unready for marriage or are considered unmarriageable by potential partners.

The Baha'i Faith believes that the widening gap between poor and wealthy 
people is a serious problem. But also the problem is the attitude that
marriage is reserved for "society's winners": those with not just a job,
but a well-paying job, and a high-status one, not the jobs held by the
sort of "necessary workers" that kept us afloat during the pandemic by doing
jobs nobody else wants; the job that lets everyone know "you're successful
and will remain so." As Shoghi Effendi's secretary once wrote on his
behalf:

>  [Young Baha'is]... should be advised, nay even encouraged, to contract 
>  marriage while still young and in full possession of their physical vigour.
>  Economic factors, no doubt, are often a serious hindrance to early 
>  marriage, but in most cases are only an excuse, and as such should not 
>  be overstressed.

Want more families? Allow people to form families. It's as simple as that.

Now let's look at two of the reasons given by women as to why
they can't have the families they want:

* Difficulty finding a suitable marriage partner.
* Getting married later than was desired

These seem like cultural constraints, and given that, it is bewildering
that cultural critics on various stripes have argued over blaming everything
else - the role of marriage, homosexuality, women in the workforce, the
influence of feminism, literally everything other than impediments to relationship
formation and marriage. While much of the arguments may be well-intentioned, this
omission may be an unfortunate side-effect of the fact that getting to the bottom
of these problems will require changing deep-seated attitudes that all sides
hold dear for their own reasons.

Let's take the first difficulty first, since it partly explains the second.
Yes, it is difficult for women to find a suitable marriage partner. It has
always been this way, and it is wrong to force women into bad marriages, a
practice that was accepted and excused for eons before. It is also explicitly
against the Baha'i laws to do so. So the problem is as stated: there are few
suitable marriage partners.
