title: What to Do After Democracy
category: article
---

Those of us raised in the United States are given, as our birthright,
two world views which generally reign unquestioned, at least among
educated society:

* A capitalistic economy, based on "market-based" principles;
* A government which nominally democratic, and technically republican.

One measure of the widespread acceptance of these two world views is
the fact that most educated citizens cannot imagine any form of
economy or government that could possibly be superior in nature to
it. Efforts at reform or improvement tend to be framed in accordance
with how conformant any improvements are with these two world
views. Indeed, one reason for "the end of history" narrative at the
completion of the 20th century was due to a lack of any realistic
compelling alernative for these world views.

At this point, the capitalistic economy is a given. The failed
alternative economies of the late twentieth century all posed very
similar alternatives - that of massive state control. Marxist
governments imposed this for theoretical reasons; other regimes, be
they fascist, military juntas or other states imposted state control
out of convenience, all the better to confiscate the goods necessary
to pay off supporters and favored classes. Since all forms relied on
excessive state control, all suffered the same general problems.
State control caused such economies to develope inefficiencies
that made them unable to compete with capitalistic
alternatives. Whatever one may think the root cause of collaps of
these governments was, the fact that economic inefficiencies and an
inability to compete on the world states was a crucial contributor.

The nature of these inefficiencies is debateable. The textbook
explanation is that state-controlled economies lacked the pricing
mechanisms that served to send signals throughout the economy that
kept demand and supply balanced. While that may be true, it is
possible that even more damage was caused because by placing all
control in the economy in the hands of government. By doing so, it
made the government itself the prime target for the sociopathically
greedy and the grifter. As a result, these economies were not only
inefficient, but frequently run through with corruption through the
highest levels. In any event, alternatives to capatalist economies are
generally framed as _different_ capitalist economies. One may think of
the United States, China and the Nordic countries as all having
different economic systems, but it is remarkable that all of them are, in
fact, identifiably capitalistic, and it is
remarkable that the only alternative agreed upon by critics of
capitalism are heavily redistributive tax levies that transfer wealth
from the wealthy to the poor - all the while, keeping the entire basic
capitalist structure otherwise intact.

The primary problem is a lack of a thinkable, appealing
alternative. There are in fact, glimmerings of alternatives for those
who wish to look: social enterpreneurs working off of grants and
funding aggregators; economic theorists testing alternate currencies;
the open source software community, where product is given away and
services based on that product are sold. Indeed, much of the wealth
created today is in the form of intellectual property, which once
created, can be used by any number of people. But as of yet, there is no
sign of an alternative to market economies as efficient models for distribution.

If an alternative to market economics is unthinkable for lack of appealing
alternatives, alternatives to democracy is just as unthinkable. While
known alternatives to capitalism are generally viewed as disagreeable,
known alternatives to democracy are generally feared outright. It's
difficult to find alternatives to market economies, but quite easy to
find its primary alternative: the antidemocratic kleptocracy.
Indeed, much of the present concern with US Government is the
possiblity that the same thing could happen here through a
_herrenvolk_ corruption of our current system. Indeed, for all of
the alternatives of democracy in the 20th century - communism,
military dictatorships, fascism - all of them had this same underlying
dynamic of an authoritarian ruler propped up by a broad-based favored
class that worked to ensure the stability of the system. Whether this
favored class was membership in a political party, oligarchy, or
military group, did not matter; the underlying mechanism was the
same. And the result was just as horrifying for the citizens
unfortunate enough to fall under such misrule.

Perhaps as a result, alternatives to representative democracy are
rarely envisioned, if at all. While democracy has its problems, such
problems are generally aired by the extremely marginalied, or
alternatively, those who generally have little concern for a just
society. The good-government believers in liberalism, while well aware
of such flaws, instead refer to democracy as "the worst form of
government, except for all the others." Problems with democracy are
generally thought only in terms of fixing them by eliminating
corporate bias, corruption and influence-buying, or structural fixes
aimed at making the system more pure.

There is another, disagreeable, possibility: that improving government
may mean moving away from representative democracy as it is presently
thought of throughout the world. Democracies throughout the world have
similar problems:

* easy corruption
of the system by entrenched, monied interest;

* the creation of
disconnected beaurocracies that frequently have to ignore the popular
will in the name of "getting something done";

* the formation of elite decision-making bodies that frequently have
neither the skills nor the mandate to defend their decisions against
propaganda by entrenched interests that benefit from the status quo;

* a remarkable vulnerability to corruption and majoritarian abuses of
power due to the repeated ability of socoipathic demagogues to repeatednly get
themselves elected to positions of power, from which they can rig
democratic systems to serve their ends.

Defenders of both liberalism and democracy, therefore, have a
challenge: it seems they can either have a society in conformance with
liberal values, or one that values the ability of voters to chose
their representatives through majority vote, since their
representatives so frequently seem inclined to take a hammer to said
liberal values.

There is an alternative approach, though, that is frequently not
discussed: that something else is needed, besides democracy. Something
besides democracy which still
does not repeat the mistaken abuses of power that brought down those
that democracy replaced, be they monarchical, authoritarian,
totalitarian, oligarchical or otherwise.

It must be acknowledged that there is a very reasonable fear for any
government that does not incorporate democratic structures or
uses them in an indrect manner (say, by electing electors to actually
select leaders). Movements
to limit democracy and public input have frequently been
used by powerful minorities as a way to assert their power over a
majority, or by historically privileged groups to retain this
privelege in the face of public unpopularity. Yet this sort of
antidemocracy need not be the only sort, if there is a vision of
something beyond democracy that remedies its flaws without introducing
other problems.

This being a Baha'i blog, the question is if the Baha'i Faith has
ideas to lead to the next stage beyond democracy. While there ideas,
the answer is complex. The Baha'i Faith has many ideals enshrined that
are worth examining. Many of these ideals are not new, but instead
reflect some of the ideals of the founders of The United States of
America. If adopted, such ideals would surely strengthen
democracy. But the main contribution may be to suggest models that
move beyond the democratic model, while at their core remaining
democratic in form.

--------------------------------------------

    Leaders of religion, exponents of political theories, governors of
    human institutions, who at present are witnessing with perplexity
    and dismay the bankruptcy of their ideas, and the disintegration
    of their handiwork, would do well to turn their gaze to the
    Revelation of Baha'u'llah. (Shoghi Effendi, _World Order of
    Baha'u'llah_ 21-Mar-1930).

The World Order of Baha'u'llah, as spelled out by Shoghi Effendi, is
_sui generis_ among governing institutions. Its democratic makeup
frequently leads people to classify it as a democratic institution. As
such, it is seen to have all of the elements of a representational
democracy, with representatives (assemblies), executive offices, and
the normal functionaries.
 
It doesn't take much study of this structure to note that, at least
with respect to a representative democracy, there is much that doesn't
"look right" to Western eyes. Assembly votes are by plurality, not
majority. There is no formal "separation of powers." There is no
system of political parties or factions, to seemingly organize people
on the basis of comon interest. There are no nominations or runoff
elections. The representatives are not held as responsible to the
voters, which is just as well, since in practice there is no way of
knowing the way any assemblyperson voted.

From the point of view of any political scientist, then, this looks
like a flawed democracy. And the response of some Baha'is was to make
exactly that diagnosis. There have been several well-known
controversies in the past for that reason, as some academics, no doubt
steeped in the knowledge of democracies, initiated a campaign to "fix"
the elected institutions to many democratic norms. Indeed, even before
these controversies, the Universal House of Justice indicate the
difficulty some tendencies of thought were causing in the communities
of the west:

    We have noticed with concern evidences of a confusion of attitudes
    among some of the friends when they encounter difficulties in
    applying Bahá'í principles to questions of the day. On the one
    hand, they acknowledge their belief in Bahá'u'lláh and His
    teachings; on the other, they invoke Western liberal democratic
    practices when actions of Bahá'í institutions or of some of their
    fellow Bahá'ís do not accord with their expectations.

	(The Universal House of Justice, A Wider Horizon, Selected Letters 1983-1992, p. 218)

The problem is a misunderstanding of the governing structure, as set
forth in writings such as The
World Order of Baha'u'llah. While the Baha'i Faith uses "democratic
methods," the Baha'i Faith is not governed democratically, at least
not in the sense we are used to:

   This new-born Administrative Order incorporates within its
   structure certain elements which are to be found in each of the
   three recognized forms of secular government [democracy, despotism
   or aristocracy], without being in any sense a mere replica of any
   one of them, and without introducing within its machinery any of
   the objectionable features which they inherently possess.
       (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Baha'u'llah, p. 152)

What is the Baha'i Faith, then? What can be said about it, and how is
it classified? We are told that it is a model for future governance of
the human race, but if it is not a democracy, what is it?

It is a form of _participative government_ for sure. In the west, we
generally think of participative government as meaning a
representative democracy. These representative democracies may take
different forms - some are ruled with a separate executive and legislative
branch, some with a parliament. But this hides the fact that there is
really very little variance in the structure of governance. Most of
what we study in political science applies to these forms of
governance exactly, and such governments are so dominant that even
autocracies find it convenient to mimic the institutions of such
government, in spite of the fact that the resulting assemblies rarely
carry out any meaningful mandate. After all, if the government is
superfluous, why spend time being creative about it?

Such thinking overlooks the fact that there are forms of
participative government that are not representative
governments. The the alternative most westerners are familiar with is
the "direct democracy," where all matters or voted for directly by the
community. But there are other alternatives involving indirect
democracy, delegation to committees determined by lots (sortition),
consensus democracies, and numerous other variants.

A complete examination of all of the variants of democracies or
participative forms of government is out of the scope of this
paper. The point is not to enumerate them, but to show that the
western liberal outlook has become associated with an unnecessarily
narrow perspective on what a "good government" should look like. Given
this narrowing vision, even the most well-engineered, well-meaning
alternative will be discareded thoughtlessly simply on the basis of
it being unfamiliar. This is ironic given the open minded nature that
otherwise is associated with this discourse.

It is necessary to examine the Baha'i Faith with an open viewpoint to
ensure that its strengths are recognized and that it is properly
understood. If one wishes to use Baha'i governance as a model and apply its
principles to secular governances, one must surely understand the
model first, rather than misclassifying it. And any recommendations to
"reform" it cannot be done without acknowledging its strengths and
mechanisms. Once properly understood, such reasons for reform may
disappear; contrariwise, if after understood, reasons for reform
remain, then surely a strong case for such reform can be made and
justified in consultation with the community. However, if
one has misclassified its structure entirely, one has likely made
other mistakes in analysis.

Finally, such an accounting is key for the necessary defense of the
faith. There are some communities within which the Baha'i community
operates that is skeptical of any organization with governance that
does not carefully follow "Robert's Rules of Order" and give the
necessary traceability for decisions made. Others are defenders of
liberalism who would otherwise be well-wishers but react negatively to
unfamiliar constructs which may seem undemocratic. Finally there are
those who are negatively disposed toward organized religion itself and
will take any opportunity to use points of novelty to paint our
administrative organization as regressive. Proper conceptualization is
necessary to defend our institutions from a point of strength.

## A Summary of Key Baha'i Principles

There are a number of key principles that underlie Baha'i
governance. While all of these are familiar to Baha'is, it is worth
reiterating in this paper. Many are unusual for civic bodies, and all
are worth examining.

Ironically, many of these have their antecedents in recommendations by
the "founding fathers" of the US. As Baha'is, we are well aware of the
flaws of many of the historical figures that founded the United
States; for some, the accomidation made by such figures with slavery
makes any recommendations by such figures immediately
suspect. However, we should not overlook the reverence with which many
US Citizens hold such figures. This is unsurprising; at the time of
the American Revolution, the American Government, too, was _sui
generis_, and some of these ideas were adopted for the early
republic. Over time, many were discarded, some for reasons of
expedience; others, because they could not work in isolation.

Let's revisit these one at a time:

**Governing Representatives Have No Constituency**

The reasons given for elections for governing bodies are very clear
and were outlined very early in the history of the Baha'i Faith. Per
'Abdu'l-Baha:

    In the present writer's view it would be preferable if the
    election of nonpermanent members of consultative assemblies in
    sovereign states should be dependent on the will and choice of the
    people. For elected representatives will on this account be
    somewhat inclined to exercise justice, lest their reputation
    suffer and they fall into disfavor with the public.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 23)

These elected assemblies at the varying levels are conducted to legislate. Much
like in parliamentary systems, there is no formally separate executive to
carry out their orders. However, the elected persons are not to be
though of as representatives. Per Shoghi Effendi:
    
    The Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah must in no
    wise be regarded as purely democratic in character inasmuch as the
    basic assumption which requires all democracies to depend
    fundamentally upon getting their mandate from the people is
    altogether lacking in this Dispensation. In the conduct of the
    administrative affairs of the Faith, in the enactment of the
    legislation necessary to supplement the laws of the Kitab-i-Aqdas,
    the members of the Universal House of Justice, it should be borne
    in mind, are not, as Baha'u'llah's utterances clearly imply,
    responsible to those whom they represent, nor are they allowed to
    be governed by the feelings, the general opinion, and even the
    convictions of the mass of the faithful, or of those who directly
    elect them.

Rather, they are elected to come to a correct decision:

    They are to follow, in a prayerful attitude, the
    dictates and promptings of their conscience.

Additionally, in these consultations, elected assembly members are
told to disregard their own inclinations:

    The members of these Assemblies, on their part, must disregard
    utterly their own likes and dislikes, their personal interests and
    inclinations, and concentrate their minds upon those measures that
    will conduce to the welfare and happiness of the Baha'i Community
    and promote the common weal.

In other words, even should one vote for assembly members with an eye
toward electing assembly members whose views they prefer, this
strategy would be ineffective, as a dutiful assembly member would not
allow his own inclinations to interfere with decisions.

Contrariwise, the conditions of the community are indeed important,
and must inform all deliberations. Continuing, Shoghi Effendi elaborates:

    They may, indeed they
    must, acquaint themselves with the conditions prevailing among the
    community, must weigh dispassionately in their minds the merits of
    any case presented for their consideration, but must reserve for
    themselves the right of an unfettered decision. (WOB 8-Feb-1934)

Assembly members must not make their decision in isolation from the
community, but should rather be very informed with any information
community members present:

    Their function [elected representatives] is not to dictate, but to
    consult, and consult not only among themselves, but as much as
    possible with the friends whom they represent.

And futher,

    They must, at all times, avoid the spirit of exclusiveness, the
    atmosphere of secrecy, free themselves from a domineering
    attitude, and banish all forms of prejudice and passion from their
    deliberations. They should, within the limits of wise discretion,
    take the friends into their confidence, acquaint them with their
    plans, share with them their problems and anxieties, and seek
    their advice and counsel.

Indeed, the solicitaiton of advice from other Baha'is and the
cultivation of personal initiatives is one of the requirements of
anyone serving on these elcted bodies:

    Let it be made clear to every inquiring reader that among the most
    outstanding and sacred duties incumbent upon those who have been
    called upon to initiate, direct and coordinate the affairs of the
    Cause, are those that require them to win by every means in their
    power the confidence and affection of those whom it is their
    privilege to serve. Theirs is the duty to investigate and acquaint
    themselves with the considered views, the prevailing sentiments,
    the personal convictions of those whose welfare it is their solemn
    obligation to promote. Theirs is the duty to purge once for all
    their deliberations and the general conduct of their affairs from
    that air of self-contained aloofness, from the suspicion of
    secrecy, the stifling atmosphere of dictatorial assertiveness, in
    short, from every word and deed that might savor of partiality,
    self-centeredness and prejudice. Theirs is the duty, while
    retaining the sacred and exclusive right of final decision in
    their hands, to invite discussion, provide information, ventilate
    <p144> grievances, welcome advice from even the most humble and
    insignificant members of the Baha'i family, expose their motives,
    set forth their plans, justify their actions, revise if necessary
    their verdict, foster the spirit of individual initiative and
    enterprise, and fortify the sense of interdependence and
    co-partnership, of understanding and mutual confidence between
    them on one hand and all local Assemblies and individual believers
    on the other. (BA 18-Oct-1927)

**Unusual Requirements for Governing Body Representatives**


Meanwhile, the delegates to the national conventions representing the
secondary institutions have their own guidelines:

    ... it is incumbent upon the chosen delegates to consider without
    the least trace of passion and prejudice, and irrespective of any
    material consideration, the names of only those who can best
    combine the necessary qualities of unquestioned loyalty, of
    selfless devotion, of a well-trained mind, of recognized ability
    and mature experience. (BA 3-Jun-1925)

**Complete Ban on Campaigning and Electioneering**
**Necessity of Proper Control of Election Environment**

**Plurality Voting for Governing Representatives, Without Nominations**

As regards to plurality voting and voting without nominations: while
Baha'is are used to doing this, it is worth pointing out exactly how
novel this is. Additionally, as pointed out below, this was not an
early requirement. It is what was settled on during the early Assembly
formation prior even to Shoghi Effendi:

    I have consequently refrained from establishing a settled and
    uniform procedure for the election of the Assemblies of the East
    and the West, leaving them free to pursue their own methods of
    procedure which in most cases had been instituted and practiced
    during the last two decades of the life of Abdu'l-Baha.

    The general practice prevailing throughout the East is the one
    based upon the principle of plurality rather than absolute
    majority, whereby those candidates that have obtained the highest
    number of votes, irrespective of the fact whether they command an
    absolute majority of the votes cast or not, are automatically and
    definitely elected. It has been felt, with no little
    justification, that this method, admittedly disadvantageous in its
    disregard of the principle that requires that each elected member
    must secure a majority of the votes cast, does away on the other
    hand with the more serious disadvantage of restricting the freedom
    of the elector who, unhampered and unconstrained by electoral
    necessities, is called upon to vote for none but those whom prayer
    and reflection have inspired him to uphold. Moreover, the practice
    of nomination, so detrimental to the atmosphere of a silent and
    prayerful election, is viewed with mistrust inasmuch as it gives
    the right to the majority of a body that, in itself under the
    present circumstances, often constitutes a minority of all the
    elected delegates, to deny that God-given right of every elector
    to vote only in favor of those who he is conscientiously convinced
    are the most worthy candidates. Should this simple system be
    provisionally adopted, it would safeguard the spiritual principle
    of the unfettered freedom of the voter, who will thus preserve
    intact the sanctity of the choice he first made. It would avoid
    the inconvenience of securing advance nominations from absent
    delegates, and the impracticality of associating them with the
    assembled electors in the subsequent ballots that are often
    required to meet the exigencies of majority vote.

Note that this is made primarily for reasons of "freedom of
conscience." There are other reasons for this that will be described
later. Interestingly, Shoghi Effendi did not dictate this process, but
suggested it to the community:

    I would recommend these observations to your earnest
    consideration, and whatever decision you arrive at, all local
    Assemblies and individual believers, I am certain, will uphold,
    for their spiritual obligation and privilege is not only to
    consult freely and frequently with the National Spiritual
    Assembly, but to uphold as well with <p137> confidence and
    cheerfulness whatever is the considered verdict of their national
    representatives. (BA 27-May-1926)

To this author, these arrangements seem to have been provisional in
nature. However, I am aware of no effort by the institutions to
ever change or ratify this, and this author cannot ever recall this subject ever
being brought up in consultation. In any case, this is the practice
for Baha'i Assembly elections. The Universal House of Justice is free
to change such practices, any such change will be provisional, as it
could later be reversed.

**Decisions Made through Consultation**

Decisions are not to be made through diktat by a majority. Instead,
they should be made through consultation:

    Their function is not to dictate, but to consult, and consult not
    only among themselves, but **as much as possible with the friends
    whom they represent**. They must regard themselves in no other light
    but that of chosen instruments for a more efficient and dignified
    presentation of the Cause of God.

	(Shoghi Effendi, Baha'i Administration, p. 64), emphasis added
	by this author.


**Ease of Changing Governing Structures**
(see notes below)


**Strong Preference for Unanimity**


**No Political Parties or Partisan Behavior**


**Indirect Election of Secondary and Tertiary Representatives**

The local assemblies are elected through direct elections by all
community members in good standing. Not only are such members directly
elected, but they get a steady stream of input from the community in
the form of resolutions and recommendations from the nineteen-day
feast.

However, at the level of the secondary (national) and tertiary (House
of Justice) levels, the bodies are elected through indirect
elections. This is laid out in Abdu'l-Baha's Will and Testament:

    And now, concerning the House of Justice which God hath ordained
    as the source of all good and freed from all error, it must be
    elected by universal suffrage, that is, by the believers... By
    this House is meant the Universal House of Justice, that is, in
    all countries, a secondary House of Justice must be instituted,
    and these secondary Houses of Justice must elect the members of
    the Universal one. (WTAB)

These secondary Houses of Justice themselves are elected by delegates,
but these delegates represent districts based on proportional
representation, rather than by assembly. Per Shoghi Effendi:

    ...were the local
    Spiritual Assemblies, the number of whose members is strictly
    confined to <p85> nine, to elect directly the members of the
    National Spiritual Assembly -- thus maintaining the principle of a
    three-stage election -- all Baha'i localities, which must
    necessarily differ in numerical strength, would then have to share
    equally in the election of the National Spiritual Assembly -- a
    practice which would be contrary to fairness and
    justice. (BA 12-May-1925)

This is not happenstance; it appears Abdu'l-Baha himself was drawn
towards indirect elections for positions of importance. Consider this excerpt,
from _Star of the West_:

   Someone else asked regarding election and whether the country
   should be ruled by the people or by the wise ones among the people.
   
   'Abdu'l-Bahá answered: "It is evident that it is better if the
   people elect the noble ones among them, and then these elect the
   president of the republic. That is to say, the president should be
   the elect of the elect, because the public in general are not as
   well informed as they should be in regard to political affairs. The
   common people follow fame. In reality, whatever affair the wise
   people desire to execute, the common people agree to. The affairs
   should be in the hands of the wise and not of the common
   people. But the wise people must be in the utmost faithfulness and
   sincerity of purpose; they must serve all the people, and protect
   and safeguard their welfare. Consider, if you put the general
   affairs into the hands of the common people they will be ruined. If
   you put all the work into the hands of the labourer the house will
   not be built. A wise architect is needed. The work is done by the
   architect, but the common labourer suffers the hardships. The
   general draws the map of war, but the common people do the
   fighting. We cannot give them the map. Is it possible to leave a
   regiment in the hands of a soldier? But if we want to be victorious
   and conquerors, a wise, experienced person must be made commander."

	(SOW - Star of the West, Star of the West -  4)



**Expectation of Member Involvement and Input**


**Importance of Civic Virtues**


**Limited Transparency in Deliberations**

Minutes of meetings are kept, but the courses of deliberations are
held in confidence and are not released. The reason is to ensure that
Baha'is express themselves freely:

    Let us also remember that at the very root of the Cause lies the
    principle of the undoubted right of the individual to
    self-expression, his freedom to declare his conscience and set
    forth his views. (BA 23-Feb-1924)


**Emphasis on Decentralization and Federalism**

As much as possible, the secondary Houses of Justice should be
independent as possible, from interference from any other governing body:

    Moreover, the central principle guiding for the present
    the administration of the Cause has been to make the Baha'i
    National Spiritual Assemblies as independent as possible in the
    conduct of such affairs as fall within their province, and to
    lessen the hampering influence of any institution within their
    jurisdiction that might, whether directly or indirectly, impair
    their authority and prestige. (BA 12-May-1925)

While the Universal House of Justice remains the final authority, this
particular passage from Shoghi Effendi seems to warn against an
excessive involvement which would "hamper" the secondary institutions.

Likewise the secondary institutions must maintain their own balance:

    They should, within the limits imposed upon them by present-day
    circumstances, endeavor to maintain the balance in such a manner
    that the evils of over-centralization which clog, confuse and in
    the long run depreciate the value of the Baha'i services rendered
    shall on one hand be entirely avoided, and on the other the perils
    of utter decentralization with the consequent lapse of governing
    authority from the hands of the national representatives of the
    believers definitely averted. (BA 18-Oct-1927)

A similar tradeoff is given in the use of committees and andvisory
bodies in the same letter, advising them not to grant "undue
discretion to bodies that should be regarded in no other light than
that of expert advisers and executive assistants." But the primary
point is given: centralization is a problem.


Many of the ground principles of Baha'i governance are laid forth in
Shoghi Effendi's _World Order of Baha'u'llah_. Summarized among them
are the following:

    The concentration of authority in the hands of the elected
    representatives of the believers; the necessity of the submission
    of every adherent of the Faith to the considered judgment of
    Baha'i Assemblies; His preference for unanimity in decision; the
    decisive character of the majority vote; and even the desirability
    for the exercise of close supervision over all Baha'i
    publications, have been sedulously instilled by Abdu'l-Baha, as
    evidenced by His authenticated and widely-scattered Tablets. (27-Feb-1929)



To this end, there are several principles that the Baha'i Faith would
have to recommend for the evolution of secular governance. An
incomplete list would include the following:

All of these should be easily recognizable to Baha'is. 

Let's go through these recommendations one at a time.


## An Example: Rule By Jury (Sortition)

I have tended to use the phrase "participative democracy" when
describing the Baha'i governing system. Let no one doubt - the Baha'i
Administrative Order **is** a democracy. However, it is unusual enough
that one may legitimately consider it as an entirely new structure.

However, there is one historical structure that this has some elements
in common with - the rule by "sortition," or rule by jury. The best
known example is that of certain Greek communities of antiquity, where
rulers were drawn from citizens by lots.


## Some Further Notes

Before discussing what the Baha'i Faith has to offer in this area,
there are some important caveats that need to be acknowledged. This is
important to prevent overselling how much the Baha'i
Faith can assist.

The Baha'i Faith has much writings discussing the issue of
governance. However, it is important to note this is not the primary
purpose of the Baha'i Faith. It addresses this issue extensively,
insofar as it serve the purpose of "creating an ever-advancing
civilization." However, the Baha'i Faith cannot be confused with a
political system, or even a movement of social reform, much as it can
contribute to those areas.

A first point is that the Baha'i Institutions, as they currently
exists, are primary spiritual instatutions for the propagation and
protection of The Faith. As such, they are limited in both the power
and sphere of operation. While this does not mean it is impractical to
look at Baha'i governance and decision-making as I am now doing, it
does mean that certain values and ethical mores may reasonably be
presumed in Baha'i governance that cannot be presumed to exist in
secular political solutions. This means that one cannot will the
existence of certain values habits of behavior without creating
institutions for their inclulation - whereas with any religious
institution, what presumes that these values are present, them being
the entire reason for said religious institution!

For instance, the fact that elections must take place in an atmosphere
of reverent reflection and prayer is seen as central to governance,
but it requires more elaboration and controls in practice. For an
example of such controls, compare the ban against electioneering in
the Baha'i Faith against ordinances against electioneering at polling
booth in the US. Electioneering in Baha'i voting is so unthinkable
that controls are rarely thought of, while in the United States, there
are usually law enforcement officials who will slap handcuffs on you
if you don't stay outside of the orange pylons at the polling booth
when handing out pamphlets.

This means we need to cast a more
skeptical eye on practices that could be easy to corrupt due to bad
faith and agency concerns. For instance, the diversity necessary for proper
selection of Spiritual Assemblies could easily be frustrated by the
use of "block voting" by groups within organizations. Wispering
campaigns could be used to target elected members, perhaps initiated
by electees who wish to drive out a member with unknown views. Members
could likewise selectively leak their opposition to initiatives
sponsored by their own bodies, to limit its effectiveness. This does
not mean that secular governance cannot learn from the Baha'i Faith,
but it does mean that additional safeguards not practiced by Baha'is
must be introduced.

## Not a Final Stage

Second, and possibly more importantly, is the fact that it is easy to
misread the current development of the institutions of the Faith and
presume that future developments will inevitably lead to a rebirth of the
"corporate state," similar to the Catholic Church in the time prior to
Vatican I reform - a unitary merge of State and Religion in which the
Baha'i Faith's own institution of governance, as it _currently
exists_, is the central point of centralized control for this
government. The Baha'i Faith has much to say about government, but it
is a misreading to think that _current_ institutions are anything more
than an embryonic foreshadowing of what may happen in the future. It
is tempting, but probably inappropriate at this present moment, to
envision how the involvement of Baha'i institutions will secular
institutions in the future.

The Baha'i Faith anticipates the formation of a world government; it
anticipates the formation over time of an entire world commonwealth;
it even prophecies a golden age in which these two merge. This is quite
explicit in Shoghi Effendi's _World Order of Baha'u'llah_:

    ... as the Baha'i Faith permeates the masses of the peoples of
    East and West, and its truth is embraced by the majority of the
    peoples of a number of the Sovereign States of the world, will the
    Universal House of Justice attain the plenitude of its power, and
    exercise, as the supreme organ of the Baha'i Commonwealth, all the
    rights, the duties, and responsibilities incumbent upon the
    world's future super-state.

Critics have used this fact to levy against the Faith the charge that
what we seek is a new Caliphate. Baha'is have tended to react by
pointing out the noncoercive nature of Baha'i membership and the
democratic mechanism of elections. What both critics and defenders
fail to realize that the institutions of the Faith themselves are
intended to evolve over time. The current form of Baha'i governance is
not in its ideal, finished state - no more than the present
presedential or parliamentary forms of democratic governance are in
their finished state. Shoghi Effendi explicitly indicates that the
primary difference between these rests in the fact that it is
explicitly outlined by our Prophet and Founder Baha'u'llah, but such
an argument is unlikely to convince a skeptic. The other primary
difference he gives may be more meaningful:

    ... whatever is deemed necessary to incorporate into it in order
    to keep it in the forefront of all progressive movements, can,
    according to the provisions made by Baha'u'llah, be safely
    embodied therein. To this testify the words of Baha'u'llah, as
    recorded in the Eighth Leaf of the exalted Paradise: "It is
    incumbent upon the Trustees of the House of Justice to take
    counsel together regarding those things which have not outwardly
    been revealed in the Book, and to enforce that which is agreeable
    to them. God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He willeth,
    and He, verily, is the Provider, the Omniscient." Not only has the
    House of Justice been invested by Baha'u'llah with the authority
    to legislate whatsoever has not been explicitly and outwardly
    recorded in His holy Writ, upon it has also been conferred by the
    Will and Testament of Abdu'l-Baha the right and power to abrogate,
    according to the changes and requirements of the time, whatever
    has been already enacted and enforced by a preceding House of
    Justice. (21-Mar-1930)

That is, because the law and structure of the governance is not laid
down, it is possible to make whatever changes to administrative
structure that is required going forward. Very importantly, it implies
that decisions made are never final, and prior decision is never truly
binding. This implies a level of dynamism in its structure that many
believers may not be aware of. Most Americans are used to the
near-impossibility of amending the constitution and believe it to be a
necessary part of democracy, unaware that many political scientists
consider that to be its most serious flaw. Again, Shoghi Effendi:

    Not only will the present-day Spiritual Assemblies be styled
    differently in future, but they will be enabled also to add
    to their present functions those powers, duties, and prerogatives
    necessitated by the recognition of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, not
    merely as one of the recognized religious systems of the world,
    but as the State Religion of an independent and Sovereign Power.
    (27-Feb-1929)

And similarly with regard to the institutions of that time:

    ... the whole machinery of assemblies, of committees and
    conventions is to be regarded as a means, and not an end in
    itself; that they will rise or fall according to their capacity to
    further the interests, to coordinate the activities, to apply the
    principles, to embody the ideals and execute the purpose of the
    Baha'i Faith.

While this was written in 1929, Baha'is will readly admit that this
quote covers the present-day orders of the Baha'i Faith with equal accuracy.

Unfortunately, some of the wrongheaded criticism of Baha'i
institutions and Baha'i governance has actually come from influential
academics inside the Faith working with outsiders as a bloc, to change things
more to their liking. Such critics have posed "reforms" intended to
fix what they perceive as deficiencies in the present Baha'i
administrative order. Inevitably, these reforms are all things
borrowing from present-day secular governance, things such as
nominations, guarantees of separation of church and state, and various
other things. Many Baha'i defenders were quick to reject these
reforms, seeing a campaign carried out in isolation from the greater
community. A greater flaw was that some of this campaign may have been
simply an attempt to get Baha'i institutions to 
conform to civic best-practices. As stated by the Guardian:

    Let us be on our guard lest we measure too strictly the Divine
    Plan with the standard of men. I am not prepared to state that it
    agrees in principle or in method with the prevailing notions now
    uppermost in men's minds, nor that it should conform with those
    imperfect, precarious, and expedient measures feverishly resorted
    to by agitated humanity. (BA )

Meanwhile, not all of the defenders have the awareness to point out that
the institutions of the Baha'i Faith are hardly and an ideal state
themselves. Nor should they be expected to be. Perhaps some Baha'is
are offended by the idea of "reform," as they may think it implies the
fact the Baha'i Faith is imperfect. But in fact, the institutions are
themselves not finished; indeed, they are "reformed" every time a
change is introduced, such as Area Teaching committees or Regional
councils. Talking about "reform" is only a problem when such a
campaign is carried out in an orchestrated manner with help from
parties outside of the Baha'i Faith that excludes dissenting voices
from such a conversation; and this is particularly so when such efforts
bypass existing channels for suggesting change and instead are
directed to a world at large that is still quite ignorant and
suspicious about anything this Faith may offer.

The caveat, therefore, is that what the Baha'i Faith has to offer are
probably not specific structures or models for consitutions.
Instead, what it has to offer at this point are principles. We know
based on the writings that however the Administrative Order may
evolve, there are certain principles that it must conform with. It is
mainly these principles that can be used to evolve the next step in
the life of secular institutions.


---------------------------------

    The Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah must in no
    wise be regarded as purely democratic in character inasmuch as the
    basic assumption which requires all democracies to depend
    fundamentally upon getting their mandate from the people is
    altogether lacking in this Dispensation. In the conduct of the
    administrative affairs of the Faith, in the enactment of the
    legislation necessary to supplement the laws of the Kitab-i-Aqdas,
    the members of the Universal House of Justice, it should be borne
    in mind, are not, as Baha'u'llah's utterances clearly imply,
    responsible to those whom they represent, nor are they allowed to
    be governed by the feelings, the general opinion, and even the
    convictions of the mass of the faithful, or of those who directly
    elect them. They are to follow, in a prayerful attitude, the
    dictates and promptings of their conscience. They may, indeed they
    must, acquaint themselves with the conditions prevailing among the
    community, must weigh dispassionately in their minds the merits of
    any case presented for their consideration, but must reserve for
    themselves the right of an unfettered decision. (WOB 8-Feb-1934)

    And now, concerning the House of Justice which God hath ordained
    as the source of all good and freed from all error, it must be
    elected by universal suffrage, that is, by the believers. Its
    members must be manifestations of the fear of God and daysprings
    of knowledge and understanding, must be steadfast in God's faith
    and the well-wishers of all mankind. By this House is meant the
    Universal House of Justice, that is, in all countries, a secondary
    House of Justice must be instituted, and these secondary Houses of
    Justice must elect the members of the Universal one. Unto this
    body all things must be referred. It enacteth all ordinances and
    regulations that are not to be found in the explicit Holy Text. (WTAB)

    [In order to avoid division and disruption, that the Cause may not
    fall a prey to conflicting interpretations, and lose thereby its
    purity and pristine vigor, that its affairs may be conducted with
    efficiency and promptness], it is necessary that every one should
    conscientiously take an active part in the election of these
    Assemblies, abide by their decisions, enforce their decree, and
    cooperate with them wholeheartedly in their task of stimulating
    the growth of the Movement throughout all regions. The members of
    these Assemblies, on their part, must disregard utterly their own
    likes and dislikes, their personal interests and inclinations, and
    concentrate their minds upon those measures that will conduce to
    the welfare and happiness of the Baha'i Community and promote the
    common weal. (BA 12-Mar-1923)

    Let us also remember that at the very root of the Cause lies the
    principle of the undoubted right of the individual to
    self-expression, his freedom to declare his conscience and set
    forth his views. (BA 23-Feb-1924)

    Their function [elected representatives] is not to dictate, but to
    consult, and consult not only among themselves, but as much as
    possible with the friends whom they represent. They must regard
    themselves in no other light but that of chosen instruments for a
    more efficient and dignified presentation of the Cause of
    God. They should never be led to suppose that they are the central
    ornaments of the body of the Cause, intrinsically superior to
    others in capacity or merit, and sole promoters of its teachings
    and principles. They should approach their task with extreme
    humility, and endeavor, by their open-mindedness, their high sense
    of justice and duty, their candor, their modesty, their entire
    devotion to the welfare and interests of the friends, the Cause,
    and humanity, to win, not only the confidence and the genuine
    support and respect of those whom they serve, but also their
    esteem and real affection. They must, at all times, avoid the
    spirit of exclusiveness, the atmosphere of secrecy, free
    themselves from a domineering attitude, and banish all forms of
    prejudice and passion from their deliberations. They should,
    within the limits of wise discretion, take the friends into their
    confidence, acquaint them with their plans, share with them their
    problems and anxieties, and seek their advice and counsel. And,
    when they are called upon to arrive at a certain decision, they
    should, after dispassionate, anxious and cordial consultation,
    turn to God in prayer, and with earnestness and conviction and
    courage record their vote and abide by the voice of the majority,
    which we are told by our Master to be the voice of truth, never to
    be challenged, and always to be whole-heartedly enforced. To this
    voice the friends must heartily respond, and regard it as the only
    means that can insure the protection and advancement of the
    Cause. (BA 23-Feb-1924)

    In one of His earliest Tablets, however, addressed to a friend in
    Persia, the following is expressly recorded: --

	"At whatever time all the beloved of God in each country
	appoint their delegates, and these in turn elect their
	representatives, and these representatives elect a body, that
	body shall be regarded as the Supreme Baytu'l-'Adl (Universal
	House of Justice)."

    These words clearly indicate that a three-stage election has been
    provided by Abdu'l-Baha for the formation of the International
    House of Justice, and as it is explicitly provided in His Will and
    Testament that the "Secondary House of Justice (i.e., National
    Assemblies) must elect the members of the Universal One," it is
    obvious that the members of the National Spiritual Assemblies will
    have to be indirectly elected by the body of the believers in
    their respective provinces.

    Should the appointing of the delegates be made a part of the
    functions of local Spiritual Assemblies, who are already elected
    bodies, the principle of a four-stage election would be introduced
    which would be at variance with the provisions explicitly laid
    down in the Master's Tablet. On the other hand, were the local
    Spiritual Assemblies, the number of whose members is strictly
    confined to <p85> nine, to elect directly the members of the
    National Spiritual Assembly -- thus maintaining the principle of a
    three-stage election -- all Baha'i localities, which must
    necessarily differ in numerical strength, would then have to share
    equally in the election of the National Spiritual Assembly -- a
    practice which would be contrary to fairness and
    justice. Moreover, the central principle guiding for the present
    the administration of the Cause has been to make the Baha'i
    National Spiritual Assemblies as independent as possible in the
    conduct of such affairs as fall within their province, and to
    lessen the hampering influence of any institution within their
    jurisdiction that might, whether directly or indirectly, impair
    their authority and prestige. (BA 12-May-1925)

    ... it is incumbent upon the chosen delegates to consider without
    the least trace of passion and prejudice, and irrespective of any
    material consideration, the names of only those who can best
    combine the necessary qualities of unquestioned loyalty, of
    selfless devotion, of a well-trained mind, of recognized ability
    and mature experience. (BA 3-Jun-1925)

    I have consequently refrained from establishing a settled and
    uniform procedure for the election of the Assemblies of the East
    and the West, leaving them free to pursue their own methods of
    procedure which in most cases had been instituted and practiced
    during the last two decades of the life of Abdu'l-Baha.

    The general practice prevailing throughout the East is the one
    based upon the principle of plurality rather than absolute
    majority, whereby those candidates that have obtained the highest
    number of votes, irrespective of the fact whether they command an
    absolute majority of the votes cast or not, are automatically and
    definitely elected. It has been felt, with no little
    justification, that this method, admittedly disadvantageous in its
    disregard of the principle that requires that each elected member
    must secure a majority of the votes cast, does away on the other
    hand with the more serious disadvantage of restricting the freedom
    of the elector who, unhampered and unconstrained by electoral
    necessities, is called upon to vote for none but those whom prayer
    and reflection have inspired him to uphold. Moreover, the practice
    of nomination, so detrimental to the atmosphere of a silent and
    prayerful election, is viewed with mistrust inasmuch as it gives
    the right to the majority of a body that, in itself under the
    present circumstances, often constitutes a minority of all the
    elected delegates, to deny that God-given right of every elector
    to vote only in favor of those who he is conscientiously convinced
    are the most worthy candidates. Should this simple system be
    provisionally adopted, it would safeguard the spiritual principle
    of the unfettered freedom of the voter, who will thus preserve
    intact the sanctity of the choice he first made. It would avoid
    the inconvenience of securing advance nominations from absent
    delegates, and the impracticality of associating them with the
    assembled electors in the subsequent ballots that are often
    required to meet the exigencies of majority vote.

    I would recommend these observations to your earnest
    consideration, and whatever decision you arrive at, all local
    Assemblies and individual believers, I am certain, will uphold,
    for their spiritual obligation and privilege is not only to
    consult freely and frequently with the National Spiritual
    Assembly, but to uphold as well with <p137> confidence and
    cheerfulness whatever is the considered verdict of their national
    representatives. (BA 27-May-1926)

    They should, within the limits imposed upon them by present-day
    circumstances, endeavor to maintain the balance in such a manner
    that the evils of over-centralization which clog, confuse and in
    the long run depreciate the value of the Baha'i services rendered
    shall on one hand be entirely avoided, and on the other the perils
    of utter decentralization with the consequent lapse of governing
    authority from the hands of the national representatives of the
    believers definitely averted. The absorption of the petty details
    of Baha'i administration by the personnel of the National
    Spiritual Assembly is manifestly injurious to efficiency and an
    expert discharge of Baha'i duties, whilst the granting of undue
    discretion to bodies that should be regarded in no other light
    than that of expert advisers and executive assistants would
    jeopardize the very vital and pervading powers that are the sacred
    prerogatives of bodies that in time will evolve into Baha'i
    National Houses of Justice. (BA 18-Oct-1927)

    Let it be made clear to every inquiring reader that among the most
    outstanding and sacred duties incumbent upon those who have been
    called upon to initiate, direct and coordinate the affairs of the
    Cause, are those that require them to win by every means in their
    power the confidence and affection of those whom it is their
    privilege to serve. Theirs is the duty to investigate and acquaint
    themselves with the considered views, the prevailing sentiments,
    the personal convictions of those whose welfare it is their solemn
    obligation to promote. Theirs is the duty to purge once for all
    their deliberations and the general conduct of their affairs from
    that air of self-contained aloofness, from the suspicion of
    secrecy, the stifling atmosphere of dictatorial assertiveness, in
    short, from every word and deed that might savor of partiality,
    self-centeredness and prejudice. Theirs is the duty, while
    retaining the sacred and exclusive right of final decision in
    their hands, to invite discussion, provide information, ventilate
    <p144> grievances, welcome advice from even the most humble and
    insignificant members of the Baha'i family, expose their motives,
    set forth their plans, justify their actions, revise if necessary
    their verdict, foster the spirit of individual initiative and
    enterprise, and fortify the sense of interdependence and
    co-partnership, of understanding and mutual confidence between
    them on one hand and all local Assemblies and individual believers
    on the other. (BA 18-Oct-1927)

a 1914 redux: "Inspired by ideologies ranging from an almost
    incoherent anarchism at one extreme to sharply honed racist and
    nationalist obsessions at the other, these underground forces
    shared one naïve conviction: if the particular part of the
    prevailing order that had become their target could somehow be
    brought down, the inherent nobility of the segment of humankind
    that supported their aims—or the assumed nobility of humankind in
    general—would by itself ensure a new era of freedom and
    justice. (COL)

    ... it was ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá who made certain that the Divine Order
    conceived by Bahá’u’lláh for the unification of the human race and
    the institution of justice in humanity’s collective life would be
    provided with the means required to realize its Founder’s
    purpose. For unity to exist among human beings — at even the
    simplest level — two fundamental conditions must pertain. Those
    involved must first of all be in some agreement about the nature
    of reality as it affects their relationships with one another and
    with the phenomenal world. They must, secondly, give assent to
    some recognized and authoritative means by which decisions will be
    taken that affect their association with one another and that
    determine their collective goals. 

    Unity is not, that is, merely a condition resulting from a sense
    of mutual goodwill and common purpose, however profound and
    sincerely held such sentiments may be, any more than an organism
    is a product of some fortuitous and amorphous association of
    various elements. Unity is a phenomenon of creative power, whose
    existence becomes apparent through the effects that collective
    action produces and whose absence is betrayed by the impotence of
    such efforts. However handicapped it often has been by ignorance
    and perversity, this force has been the primary influence driving
    the advancement of civilization, generating legal codes, social
    and political institutions, artistic works, technological
    achievements without end, moral breakthroughs, material
    prosperity, and long periods of public peace whose afterglow lived
    in the memories of subsequent generations as imagined “golden
    ages.” (COL)

    regarding current conditions anticipated by Shoghi Effendi: 
    The landscape of international affairs would, he said, be
    increasingly reshaped by twin forces of “integration” and
    “disintegration”, both of them ultimately beyond human control. In
    the light of what meets our eyes today, his previsioning of the
    operation of this dual process is breathtaking: the creation of “a
    mechanism of world inter-communication … functioning with
    marvellous swiftness and perfect regularity”;[62] the undermining
    of the nation-state as the chief arbiter of human destiny; the
    devastating effects that advancing moral breakdown throughout the
    world would have on social cohesion; the widespread public
    disillusionment produced by political corruption; and—
    unimaginable to others of his generation—the rise of global
    agencies dedicated to promoting human welfare, coordinating
    economic activity, defining international standards, and
    encouraging a sense of solidarity among diverse races and
    cultures. These and other developments, the Guardian explained,
    would fundamentally alter the conditions in which the Bahá’í Cause
    would pursue its mission in the decades lying ahead. (COL)
 
    As the Bahá’í community was constructing administrative
    foundations which would permit it to play an effective role in
    human affairs, the accelerating process of disintegration that
    Shoghi Effendi had discerned was undermining the fabric of social
    order. Its origins, however determinedly ignored by many social
    and political theorists, are beginning, after the lapse of several
    decades, to gain recognition at international conferences devoted
    to peace and development. In our own time, it is no longer unusual
    to encounter in such circles candid references to the essential
    role that “spiritual” and “moral” forces must play in achieving
    solutions to urgent problems (COL)

    The yearning for belief is inextinguishable, an inherent part of
    what makes one human. When it is blocked or betrayed, the rational
    soul is driven to seek some new compass point, however inadequate
    or unworthy, around which it can organize experience and dare
    again to assume the risks that are an inescapable aspect of
    life. It was in this perspective that Shoghi Effendi warned the
    members of the Faith, in unusually strong language, that they must
    try to understand the spiritual calamity engulfing a large part of
    humankind during the decades between the two world wars:
 
        God Himself has indeed been dethroned from the hearts of men,
        and an idolatrous world passionately and clamorously hails and
        worships the false gods which its own idle fancies have
        fatuously created, and its misguided hands so impiously
        exalted.… Their high priests are the politicians and the
        worldly-wise, the so-called sages of the age; their sacrifice,
        the flesh and blood of the slaughtered multitudes; their
        incantations, outworn shibboleths and insidious and irreverent
        formulas; their incense, the smoke of anguish that ascends
        from the lacerated hearts of the bereaved, the maimed, and the
        homeless.[79]
 
    Like opportunistic infections, aggressive ideologies took
    advantage of the situation created by the decline of religious
    vitality. (COL)

    Long before it and its leader had been swept into oblivion during
    the concluding months of the second world war, Fascism had become
    an object of ridicule among the majority of even those who had
    originally supported it. Its significance lies, rather, in the
    host of imitators it spawned and which were to proliferate
    throughout the world like some malignant series of mutations, in
    the decades since then. Fuelled by a manic nationalism, this
    aberration of the human spirit deified the state, discovered
    everywhere imaginary threats to the national survival of whatever
    unhappy people it had fastened upon, and preached to all who would
    listen the notion that war has an “ennobling” influence on the
    human soul. The comic opera parade of uniforms, jackboots, banners
    and trumpets usually associated with it should not conceal from a
    contemporary observer the virulent legacy it has left in our own
    age, enshrining in political vocabulary such anguished terms as
    desaparecidos (“the disappeared”). (COL)

    Like Fascism, Naziism has left a detritus in our own time. In its
    case, this takes the form of a language and symbols through which
    fringe elements in present-day society, demoralized by the
    economic and social decay around them and made desperate by the
    absence of solutions, vent their impotent rage on minorities whom
    they blame for their disappointments. (COL)

    To a degree never before imagined, let alone attempted, the
    Leninist conspiracy against human nature also sought
    systematically to extinguish faith in God. Whatever view of the
    situation political theorists may currently hold, no one can be
    surprised that such deliberate violence to the roots of human
    motivation led inexorably to the economic and political ruin of
    those societies luckless enough to fall under Soviet sway. Its
    longer-term spiritual effect, tragically, was to pervert to the
    service of its own amoral agenda the legitimate yearnings for
    freedom and justice of subject peoples throughout the world. 

    From a Bahá’í point of view, humanity’s worship of idols of its
    own invention is of importance not because of the historical
    events associated with these forces, however horrifying, but
    because of the lesson it taught. Looking back on the twilight
    world in which such diabolical forces loomed over humanity’s
    future, one must ask what was the weakness in human nature that
    rendered it vulnerable to such influences. To have seen in someone
    like Benito Mussolini the figure of a “Man of Destiny”, to have
    felt obliged to understand the racial theories of Adolf Hitler as
    anything other than the self-evident products of a diseased mind,
    to have seriously entertained the reinterpretation of human
    experience through dogmas that had given birth to the Soviet Union
    of Josef Stalin—so wilful an abandonment of reason on the part of
    a considerable segment of the intellectual leadership of society
    demands an accounting to posterity. (COL)

     What Bahá’í institutions do, rather, is to strive to align the
     work of the Cause with the Divinely impelled process they see
     steadily unfolding in the world, a process that will ultimately
     realize its purpose, regardless of historical circumstances or
     events. The challenge to the Administrative Order is to ensure
     that, as Providence allows, Bahá’í efforts are in harmony with
     this Greater Plan of God, because it is in doing so that the
     potentialities implanted in the Cause by Bahá’u’lláh bear their

    How pathetic indeed are the efforts of those leaders of human
    institutions who, in utter disregard of the spirit of the age, are
    striving to adjust national processes, suited to the ancient days
    of self-contained nations, to an age which must either achieve the
    unity of the world, as adumbrated by Baha'u'llah, or perish. At so
    critical an hour in the history of civilization it behooves the
    leaders of all the nations of the world, great and small, whether
    in the East or in the West, whether victors or vanquished, to give
    heed to the clarion call of Baha'u'llah and, thoroughly imbued
    with a sense of <p37> world solidarity, the sine qua non of
    loyalty to His Cause, arise manfully to carry out in its entirety
    the one remedial scheme He, the Divine Physician, has prescribed
    for an ailing humanity. (WOB 28-Nov-1931)

    The call of Baha'u'llah is primarily directed against all forms of
    provincialism, all insularities and prejudices. If long-cherished
    ideals and time-honored institutions, if certain social
    assumptions and religious formulae have ceased to promote the
    welfare of the generality of mankind, if they no longer minister
    to the needs of a continually evolving humanity, let them be swept
    away and relegated to the limbo of obsolescent and forgotten
    doctrines. Why should these, in a world subject to the immutable
    law of change and decay, be exempt from the deterioration that
    must needs overtake every human institution? For legal standards,
    political and economic theories are solely designed to safeguard
    the interests of humanity as a whole, and not humanity to be
    crucified for the preservation of the integrity of any particular
    law or doctrine. (WOB 28-Nov-1931)

    The principle of the Oneness of Mankind -- the pivot round which
    all the teachings of Baha'u'llah revolve <p43> -- is no mere
    outburst of ignorant emotionalism or an expression of vague and
    pious hope... It does not constitute merely the enunciation of an
    ideal, but stands inseparably associated with an institution
    adequate to embody its truth, demonstrate its validity, and
    perpetuate its influence. It implies an organic change in the
    structure of present-day society, a change such as the world has
    not yet experienced. It constitutes a challenge, at once bold and
    universal, to outworn shibboleths of national creeds -- creeds
    that have had their day and which must, in the ordinary course of
    events as shaped and controlled by Providence, give way to a new
    gospel, fundamentally different from, and infinitely superior to,
    what the world has already conceived. It calls for no less than
    the reconstruction and the demilitarization of the whole civilized
    world -- a world organically unified in all the essential aspects
    of its life, its political machinery, its spiritual aspiration,
    its trade and finance, its script and language, and yet infinite
    in the diversity of the national characteristics of its federated
    units. (WOB 28-Nov-1931)

    Their common, their fundamental object is to insure the continuity
    of that divinely-appointed authority which flows from the Source
    of our Faith, to safeguard the unity of its followers and to
    maintain the integrity and flexibility of its teachings. Acting in
    conjunction with each other these two inseparable institutions
    administer its affairs, coordinate its activities, promote its
    interests, execute its laws and defend its subsidiary
    institutions.  (WOB 8-Feb-1934)

    This new-born Administrative Order incorporates within its
    structure certain elements which are to be found in each of the
    three recognized forms of secular government [democracy,
    autocracy/dictatorship, aristocracy/monarchy/oligarchy;
    cross-reference to Aristotle's three types], without being in any
    sense a mere replica of any one of them, and without introducing
    within its machinery any of the objectionable features which they
    inherently possess. It blends and harmonizes, as no government
    fashioned by mortal hands has as yet accomplished, the salutary
    truths which each of these systems undoubtedly contains <p153>
    without vitiating the integrity of those God-given verities on
    which it is ultimately founded. (WOB 8-Feb-1934)

    A parallel might almost be drawn between these confused and
    confusing systems of thought that are the direct outcome of the
    helplessness and confusion afflicting the Christian Faith and the
    great variety of popular cults, of fashionable and evasive
    philosophies which flourished in the opening centuries of the
    Christian Era, and which attempted to absorb and pervert the state
    religion of that Roman people. The pagan worshipers who
    constituted, at that time, the bulk of the population of the
    Western Roman Empire, found themselves surrounded, and in certain
    instances menaced, by the prevailing sect of the Neo-Platonists,
    by the followers of nature religions, by Gnostic philosophers, by
    Philonism, Mithraism, the adherents of the Alexandrian cult, and a
    multitude of kindred sects <p185> and beliefs, in much the same
    way as the defenders of the Christian Faith, the preponderating
    religion of the western world, are realizing, in the first century
    of the Baha'i Era, how their influence is being undermined by a
    flood of conflicting beliefs, practices and tendencies which their
    own bankruptcy had helped to create. It was, however, this same
    Christian Religion, which has now fallen into such a state of
    impotence, that eventually proved itself capable of sweeping away
    the institutions of paganism and of swamping and suppressing the
    cults that had flourished in that age.

	Such institutions as have strayed far from the spirit and
	teachings of Jesus Christ must of necessity, as the embryonic
	World Order of Baha'u'llah takes shape and unfolds, recede
	into the background, and make way for the progress of the
	divinely-ordained institutions that stand inextricably
	interwoven with His teachings. The indwelling Spirit of God
	which, in the Apostolic Age of the Church, animated its
	members, the pristine purity of its teachings, the primitive
	brilliancy of its light, will, no doubt, be reborn and revived
	as the inevitable consequence of this redefinition of its
	fundamental verities, and the clarification of its original
	purpose. (WOB 11-Mar-1936)

    ... the dignity and unity of the Cause urgently demands --
    particularly throughout the American continent -- that the friends
    should in their words and conduct emphasize and give absolute
    prominence to the constructive dynamic principles of Baha'u'llah,
    rather than attach undue importance to His negative Teachings. (BA
    5-Mar-1922)

    [regarding the continued necessity of publication review]
    So great
    is the importance and so supreme is the authority of these
    assemblies that once Abdu'l-Baha after having himself and in his
    own handwriting corrected the translation made into Arabic of the
    Ishraqat (the Effulgences) by Sheikh Faraj, a Kurdish friend from
    Cairo, directed him in a Tablet to submit the above-named
    translation to the Spiritual Assembly of Cairo, that he may seek
    from them before publication their approval and consent. These are
    His very words in that Tablet: -- "His honor, Sheikh Faraju'llah,
    has here rendered into Arabic with greatest care the Ishraqat and
    yet I have told him that he must submit his version to the
    Spiritual Assembly of Egypt, and I have conditioned its
    publication upon the approval of the above-named Assembly. This is
    so that things may be arranged in an orderly manner, for should it
    not be so any one may translate a certain Tablet and print and
    circulate it on his own account. Even a non-believer might
    undertake such work, and thus cause confusion and disorder. If it
    be conditioned, however, upon the approval of the Spiritual
    Assembly, a translation prepared, printed and circulated by a
    non-believer will have no recognition whatever.

    This is indeed a clear indication of the Master's express desire
    that nothing whatever should be given to the public by any
    individual among the friends, unless fully considered and approved
    by the Spiritual Assembly in his locality; and if this (as is
    undoubtedly the case) is a matter that pertains to the general
    interest of the Cause in that land, then it is incumbent upon the
    Spiritual Assembly to submit it to the consideration and approval
    of the national body representing all the various local
    assemblies. (BA 5-Mar-1922)


Adjunct Texts (from _Baha'i Administration_)

	Duties of Spiritual Assemblies

	The matter of Teaching, its direction, its ways and means, its extension, its consolidation, essential as they are to the interests of the Cause, constitute by no means the only issue which should <p38> receive the full attention of these Assemblies. A careful study of Baha'u'llah's and Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets will reveal that other duties, no less vital to the interests of the Cause, devolve upon the elected representatives of the friends in every locality. 

	It is incumbent upon them to be vigilant and cautious, discreet and watchful, and protect at all times the Temple of the Cause from the dart of the mischief-maker and the onslaught of the enemy. 

	They must endeavor to promote amity and concord amongst the friends, efface every lingering trace of distrust, coolness and estrangement from every heart, and secure in its stead an active and whole-hearted cooperation for the service of the Cause. 

	They must do their utmost to extend at all times the helping hand to the poor, the sick, the disabled, the orphan, the widow, irrespective of color, caste and creed. 

	They must promote by every means in their power the material as well as the spiritual enlightenment of youth, the means for the education of children, institute, whenever possible, Baha'i educational institutions, organize and supervise their work and provide the best means for their progress and development. 

	They must make an effort to maintain official, regular, and frequent correspondence with the various Baha'i centers throughout the world, report to them their activities, and share the glad-tidings they receive with all their fellow-workers in the Cause. 

	They must encourage and stimulate by every means at their command, through subscription, reports and articles, the development of the various Baha'i magazines, such as the "Star of the West" and the "Magazine of the Children of the Kingdom" in the United States of America, the " Baha'i News" of India, the "Sun of the East" (Khurshid-i Khavar) in Turkestan, the "Star of the East" in Japan, the "Sun of Truth" in Germany. 

	They must undertake the arrangement of the regular meetings of the friends, the feasts and the anniversaries, as well as the special gatherings designed to serve and promote the social, intellectual and spiritual interests of their fellow-men. 

	They must supervise in these days when the Cause is still in its infancy all Baha'i publications and translations, and provide in general for a dignified and accurate presentation of all Baha'i literature and its distribution to the general public. <p39> 

	These rank among the most outstanding obligations of the members of every Spiritual Assembly. In whatsoever locality the Cause has sufficiently expanded, and in order to insure efficiency and avoid confusion, each of these manifold functions will have to be referred to a special Committee, responsible to that Assembly, elected by it from among the friends in that locality, and upon whose work the Assembly will have to exercise constant and general supervision. 

	These local Spiritual Assemblies will have to be elected directly by the friends, and every declared believer of 21 years and above, far from standing aloof and assuming an indifferent or independent attitude, should regard it his sacred duty to take part conscientiously and diligently, in the election, the consolidation and the efficient working of his own local Assembly.

	National Assemblies

	Regarding the establishment of "National Assemblies," it is of vital importance that in every country, where the conditions are favorable and the number of the friends has grown and reached a considerable size, such as America, Great Britain and Germany, that a "National Spiritual Assembly" be immediately established, representative of the friends throughout that country. 

	Its immediate purpose is to stimulate, unify and coordinate by frequent personal consultations, the manifold activities of the friends as well as the local Assemblies; and by keeping in close and constant touch with the Holy Land, initiate measures, and direct in general the affairs of the Cause in that country. 

	It serves also another purpose, no less essential than the first, as in the course of time it shall evolve into the National House of Justice (referred to in Abdu'l-Baha's Will as the "secondary House of Justice"), which according to the explicit text of the Testament will have, in conjunction with the other National Assemblies throughout the Baha'i world, to elect directly the members of the International House of Justice, that Supreme Council that will guide, organize and unify the affairs of the Movement throughout the world. 

	It is expressly recorded in Abdu'l-Baha's Writings that these National Assemblies must be indirectly elected by the friends; that <p40> is, the friends in every country must elect a certain number of delegates, who in their turn will elect from among all the friends in that country the members of the National Spiritual Assembly. In such countries, therefore, as America, Great Britain and Germany, a fixed number of secondary electors must first be decided upon (95 for America, including the Pacific Islands; 95 for Germany; and 19 for Great Britain). The friends then in every locality where the number of adult declared believers exceeds nine must directly elect its quota of secondary electors assigned to it in direct proportion to its numerical strength. These secondary electors will then, either through correspondence, or preferably by gathering together, and first deliberating upon the affairs of the Cause throughout their country (as the delegates to the Convention), elect from among all the friends in that country nine who will be the members of the National Spiritual Assembly. 

	This National Spiritual Assembly, which, pending the establishment of the Universal House of Justice, will have to be re-elected once a year, obviously assumes grave responsibilities, for it has to exercise full authority over all the local Assemblies in its province, and will have to direct the activities of the friends, guard vigilantly the Cause of God, and control and supervise the affairs of the Movement in general. 

	Vital issues, affecting the interests of the Cause in that country such as the matter of translation and publication, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, the Teaching Work, and other similar matters that stand distinct from strictly local affairs, must be under the full jurisdiction of the National Assembly. 

	It will have to refer each of these questions, even as the local Assemblies, to a special Committee, to be elected by the members of the National Spiritual Assembly, from among all the friends in that country, which will bear to it the same relation as the local committees bear to their respective local Assemblies. 

	With it, too, rests the decision whether a certain point at issue is strictly local in its nature, and should be reserved for the consideration and decision of the local Assembly, or whether it should fall under its own province and be regarded as a matter which ought to receive its special attention. The National Spiritual Assembly will also decide upon such matters which in its opinion <p41> should be referred to the Holy Land for consultation and decision. 

	With these Assemblies, local as well as national,
	harmoniously, vigorously, and efficiently functioning
	throughout the Baha'i world, the only means for the
	establishment of the Supreme House of Justice will have been
	secured. And when this Supreme Body will have been properly
	established, it will have to consider afresh the whole
	situation, and lay down the principle which shall direct, so
	long as it deems advisable, the affairs of the Cause.

    This sad history is of importance to an understanding of the Cause
    in the twentieth century not only because of what the Guardian
    called the “havoc” it wreaked in the Holy Family, but because of
    the light it casts on the challenges the Bahá’í community will
    increasingly face in the years ahead, challenges predicted in
    explicit language by both the Master and the Guardian. Apart from
    the insincerity that marked all too many of them, the relatives of
    Shoghi Effendi demonstrated little or no awareness of the
    spiritual nature of the role conferred on him in the Will and
    Testament. That the Revelation of God to the age of humanity’s
    maturity should have brought with it, as a central feature of its
    mission, an authority essential for the restructuring of social
    order represented a spiritual challenge they seemed unable, or
    perhaps never sought, to understand. Their abandonment of the
    Guardian is a lesson that will remain with posterity down through
    the centuries of the Bahá’í Dispensation. (COL)
