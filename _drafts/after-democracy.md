title: What to Do After Democracy
category: article
---

Those of us raised in the United States are given, as our birthright,
two world views which generally reign unquestioned, at least among
educated society:

* A capitalistic economy, based on "market-based" principles;
* A government which nominally democratic, and technically republican.

One measure of the widespread acceptance of these two world views is
the fact that most educated citizens cannot imagine any form of
economy or government that could possibly be superior in nature to
it. Efforts at reform or improvement tend to be framed in accordance
with how conformant any improvements are with these two world
views. Indeed, one reason for "the end of history" narrative at the
completion of the 20th century was due to a lack of any realistic
compelling alernative for these world views.

At this point, the capitalistic economy is a given. The failed
alternative economies of the late twentieth century all posed very
similar alternatives - that of massive state control. Marxist
governments imposed this for theoretical reasons; other regimes, be
they fascist, military juntas or other states imposted state control
out of convenience, all the better to confiscate the goods necessary
to pay off supporters and favored classes. Since all forms relied on
excessive state control, all suffered the same general problems.
State control caused such economies to develope inefficiencies
that made them unable to compete with capitalistic
alternatives. Whatever one may think the root cause of collaps of
these governments was, the fact that economic inefficiencies and an
inability to compete on the world states was a crucial contributor.

The nature of these inefficiencies
is debateable. The textbook explanation is that state-controlled
economies lacked the pricing mechanisms that served to send signals
throughout the economy that kept demand and supply balanced. While
that may be true, it is possible that even more damage was caused
because by placing all control in the economy in the hands of
government. By doing so, it made the government itself the prime target for the
sociopathically greedy and the grifter. As a result, these economies
were not only inefficient, but frequently run through with corruption
through the highest levels.

The result is that nowadays, alternatives to capatalist economies are generally
framed as _different_ capitalist economies. One may think of the
United States, China and the Nordic countries as all having different
countries, but it is remarkable that all of them are, in fact,
identifiably capitalistic. The only difference is the sphere for
regulation and how much targeted government intervention certain
narrow industries receive. Given what we know about the uneven
distribution of resources in economies throughout the world, it is
remarkable that the only alternative agreed upon by critics of
capitalism are heavily redistributive tax levies that transfer wealth
from the wealthy to keep the poor while keeping the entire basic
system otherwise intact.

If an alternative to market economics is unthinkable for lack of
alternatives, alternatives to democracy is just as unthinkable because
of the unappealing nature of known alternatives. Alternatives
to democracy are generally compared nowadays against the only
remaining alternative in the world: antidemocratic kleptocracies.
These are regimes that maintain power through delivering
favors to priveledged subgroups that maintains the regime in
place. Indeed, much of the present concern with US Government is the
possiblity that the same thing could happen here through a
_herrenvolk_ corruption of our current system. Indeed, for all of
the alternatives of democracy in the 20th century - communism,
military dictatorships, fascism - all of them had this same underlying
dynamic of an authoritarian ruler propped up by a broad-based favored
class that worked to ensure the stability of the system. Whether this
favored class was membership in a political party, oligarchy, or
military group, did not matter; the underlying mechanism was the
same. And the result was just as horrifying for the citizens
unfortunate enough to fall under such misrule.

The catalogue of failures in the present market economy is clear;
while many "market fundamentalists" have responded to shortcomings by ardently
wishing them away or dismissing them, there are plenty of more
moderate defenders will instead simply insist that it is the best
mechanism for running an economy that has yet been found. They will do
so by pointing to the nordic countries as having an ideal blend. What
such reformers frequently overlook is that this economy is at best a
happy historical accident, in spite of its obvious merits, it has yet to be
adopted in other countries. Nor is there any sign that it is possible
to keep these merits if every country adopts this model, implying it
only works simply because so few countries have committed to keeping
this path. And there is no working around the fact that this model is
a capitalistic model, albeit one with fewer evident shortcomings.

Meanwhile, failures of democracy are many. Democracy is frequently
refered to as "the worst form of government, except for all the
others." Many of the problems of democracy would seem to be one of
structure. Whether through a presidential or parliamentary system,
democracies through the world have similar problems:
* easy corruption
of the system by entrenched, monied interest;
* the creation of
disconnected beaurocracies that frequently have to ignore the popular
will in the name of "getting something done";
* the formation of elite decision-making bodies that frequently have
neither the skills nor the mandate to defend their decisions against
propaganda by entrenched interests that benefit from the status quo;
* a remarkable vulnerability to corruption and majoritarian abuses of
power due to the repeated ability of socoipathic demagogues to repeatednly get
themselves elected to positions of power, from which they can rig
democratic systems to serve their ends.

So we have two world views that are under seige. With these two world
views, there is a remarkable contrast between these challenges by most
people of good will. With regard to economic fixes, there are many
thinkers able to propose even the most radical of changes to the
economic order. Most of them are wildy impractical, requiring the sort
of massive redistrubution in wealth and resources that only seems to
happen under conditions of world war and failing empire. Yet these
alternatives do exist.

With democracy, the opposite is the case - the fix proposed for
democracy is, generally, "more democracy." And so structural changes,
such as they are, are generally aimed at this level: regulations to
ensure that monied interests do not bankroll candidates and entire
parties, constitutional fixes to make legislative bodies more
representative, and propositions to allow some measure of direct
democracy for issues of importance.

There is an alternative approach, though, that is frequently not
discussed: that something else is needed, besides democracy. Something
besides democracy which still
does not repeat the mistaken abuses of power that brought down those
that democracy replaced, be they monarchical, authoritarian,
totalitarian, oligarchical or otherwise. One reason for this
skepticism of better alternatives may have been the historical nature
of antidemocratic movements; such movements have frequently been
sought by powerful minorities as a way to assert their power over a
majority, or by historically privileged groups to retain this
privelege in the face of public unpopularity. Yet this sort of
antidemocracy need not be the only sort, if there is a vision of
something beyond democracy that seems superior.

Historically, now is the time
for something beyond both market economicas and democracy. But doing
so requires both a quantum leap of faith and imagination. And by
quantum leap, I mean this as a direct analogy - a change which is as
small as possible, but distinct enough as to be qualitatively
different.

This being a Baha'i blog, the question is if the Baha'i Faith has
ideas to lead to the next stage beyon democracy. While there ideas,
the answer is complex. While it does not have a full system, there are
some ideals enshrined in Baha'i law that are worth examining. In many
cases, these ideal are not new, but reflect many of the more
enlightened ideals of the founders of The United States of
America. This is notable, as the founders were steeped in the classic
writings from which the democratic tradition derived ligitimacy.

--------------------------------------------

Before discussing what the Baha'i Faith has to offer in this area,
there are some important caveats that need to be acknowledged. This is
important to prevent overselling, to some extent, how much the Baha'i
Faith can assist.

As indicated, with both economics and politics, the current order is
defective. While the Baha'i Faith has much to say about both, it is
important to note that it is not the primary purpose of the Baha'i
Faith to address those issues. It does address these issues
extensively, only insofar as they serve the purpose of "creating an
ever-advancing civilization." The Baha'i Faith cannot be confused with
an economic system, a political system, or even a movement of social
reform, as much as it can contribute to all threa.

A first point is that the Baha'i Institutions, as they currently
exists, are primary spiritual instatutions for the propagation and
protection of The Faith. As such, they are limited in both the power
and sphere of operation. While this does not mean it is impractical to
look at Baha'i governance and decision-making as I am now doing, it
does mean that certain values and ethical mores may reasonably be
presumed in Baha'i governance that cannot be presumed to exist in
secular political solutions. This means that one cannot will the
existence of certain values habits of behavior without creating
institutions for their inclulation - whereas with any religious
institution, what presumes that these values are present, them being
the entire reason for said religious institution!

For instance, the
fact that elections must take place in an atmosphere of reverent
reflection and prayer is seen as central to governance, but it
requires more elaboration and controls in practice. For an example of
such controls, compare the ban against electioneering in the Baha'i
Faith against ordinances against electioneering at polling booth in
the US; electioneering in Baha'i voting is so unthinkable that
controls are rarely thought of, while in the United States, there are
usually law enforcement officials who will slap handcuffs on you if
you don't stay outside of the orange pylons at the polling booth when
handing out pamphlets. This means we need to cast a more skeptical eye
on practices that could be easy to corrupt due to bad faith and agency
concerns.

Second, and possibly more importantly, is the fact that it is easy to
misread the current development of the institutions of the Faith and
impose it in a fashion reminiscent of old atttempts to establish a
"corporate state," similar to the Catholic Church in the time prior to
Vatican I reform - a unitary merge of State and Religion in which the
Baha'i Faith's own institution of governance, as it _currently
exists_, is the central point of centralized control for this
government. The Baha'i Faith has much to say about government, but it
is a misreading to think that _current_ institutions are anything more
than an embryonic foreshadowing of what may happen in the future. It
is tempting, but probably inappropriate, to use current governance
models of the Baha'i Faith and impose them as a schematic for new
forms of government on the greater world.

The Baha'i Faith anticipates the formation of a world government; it
anticipates the formation over time of an entire world commonwealth;
it even prophecies a golden age in which these two merge. Critics have
used this fact to levy against the Faith the charge that what we seek
is a new Caliphate. Baha'is have tended to react by pointing out the
noncoercive nature of Baha'i membership and the democratic mechanism
of elections. What both critics and defenders fail to realize that the
institutions of the Faith themselves are intended to evolve over time;
the current form of Baha'i governance is not in its ideal, finished
state - no more than the present presedential or parliamentary forms
of democratic governance are in its finished state.

Indeed, some of the more wrongheaded criticism of Baha'i institutions
and Baha'i governance has actually come from inside the Faith. Such
critics have posed "reforms" intended to fix what they perceive as
deficiencies in the present Baha'i administrative order. Inevitably,
these reforms are all seen as things borrowing from secular
governance, things such as nominations, guarantees of separation of
church and state, and various other things. While Baha'i defenders were
quick to reject these, not all of them had the awareness to point out
that the institutions of the Baha'i Faith are hardly and an ideal
state themselves, nor should they be expected to be. Perhaps some
Baha'is are offended by the idea of "reform," as they may think it
implies the fact the Baha'i Faith is imperfect. But in fact, the
institutions are themselves not finished, and as such; they are
"reformed" every time a change is introduced, such as Area Teaching
committees or Regional councils. Talking about "reform" is only
a problem when such a campaign is carried out in an orchestrated
manner with help from parties outside of the Baha'i Faith.

The caveat, therefore, is that what the Baha'i Faith has to offer to
the world are not structural reforms, or reforms in the nature of
mechanics of elections, separations of power and the like. Instead,
what it has to offer at this point are principles. We know based on
the writings that however the Administrative Order may evolve, there are
certain principles that it must conform with. It is mainly these
principles that can be used to evolve the next step in the life of
secular institutions.

To this end, there are several principles that the Baha'i Faith would
have to recommend for the evolution of secular governance. An
incomplete list would include the following:

1. Elimination of partisan politics
2. Re-emphasis on federalism and decentralization as a governing
principle
3. Emphasis on "republican" principle of leadership by representatives
4. Emphasis on universal participation in politics
5. Improved participation by individuals in matters of governance
6. Proper education in civic virtues
7. Indirect election of higher-level offices

All of these should be easily recognizable to Baha'is. Ironically,
many of these have their antecedents in recommendations by the
"founding fathers" of the US. As Baha'is, we are well aware of the
flaws of many of the historical figures that founded the United
States; for some, the accomidation made by such figures with slavery
makes makes any recommendations by such figures immediately
suspect. However, we should not overlook the reverence with which many
US Citizens hold such figures. If we can use their arguments to
advance the ways in which the Baha'i Faith can improve our own civic
governance, we should do so.

Let's go through these recommendations one at a time.
