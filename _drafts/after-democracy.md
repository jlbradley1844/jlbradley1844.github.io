title: What to Do After Democracy
category: article
---

Those of us raised in the United States are given, as our birthright,
two world views which generally reign unquestioned, at least among
educated society:

* A capitalistic economy, based on "market-based" principles;
* A government which nominally democratic, and technically republican.

One measure of the widespread acceptance of these two world views is
the fact that most educated citizens cannot imagine any form of
economy or government that could possibly be superior in nature to
it. Efforts at reform or improvement tend to be framed in accordance
with how conformant any improvements are with these two world
views. Indeed, one reason for "the end of history" narrative at the
completion of the 20th century was due to a lack of any realistic
compelling alernative for these world views.

At this point, the capitalistic economy is a given. The failed
alternative economies of the late twentieth century all posed very
similar alternatives - that of massive state control. Marxist
governments imposed this for theoretical reasons; other regimes, be
they fascist, military juntas or other states imposted state control
out of convenience, all the better to confiscate the goods necessary
to pay off supporters and favored classes. Since all forms relied on
excessive state control, all suffered the same general problems.
State control caused such economies to develope inefficiencies
that made them unable to compete with capitalistic
alternatives. Whatever one may think the root cause of collaps of
these governments was, the fact that economic inefficiencies and an
inability to compete on the world states was a crucial contributor.

The nature of these inefficiencies is debateable. The textbook
explanation is that state-controlled economies lacked the pricing
mechanisms that served to send signals throughout the economy that
kept demand and supply balanced. While that may be true, it is
possible that even more damage was caused because by placing all
control in the economy in the hands of government. By doing so, it
made the government itself the prime target for the sociopathically
greedy and the grifter. As a result, these economies were not only
inefficient, but frequently run through with corruption through the
highest levels.

The result is that nowadays, alternatives to capatalist economies are
generally framed as _different_ capitalist economies. One may think of
the United States, China and the Nordic countries as all having
different countries, but it is remarkable that all of them are, in
fact, identifiably capitalistic. The only difference is the sphere for
regulation and how much targeted government intervention certain
narrow industries receive. Given what we know about the uneven
distribution of resources in economies throughout the world, it is
remarkable that the only alternative agreed upon by critics of
capitalism are heavily redistributive tax levies that transfer wealth
from the wealthy to keep the poor while keeping the entire basic
system otherwise intact.

If an alternative to market economics is unthinkable for lack of
alternatives, alternatives to democracy is just as unthinkable because
of the unappealing nature of known alternatives. Alternatives
to democracy are generally compared nowadays against the only
remaining alternative in the world: antidemocratic kleptocracies.
These are regimes that maintain power through delivering
favors to priveledged subgroups that maintains the regime in
place. Indeed, much of the present concern with US Government is the
possiblity that the same thing could happen here through a
_herrenvolk_ corruption of our current system. Indeed, for all of
the alternatives of democracy in the 20th century - communism,
military dictatorships, fascism - all of them had this same underlying
dynamic of an authoritarian ruler propped up by a broad-based favored
class that worked to ensure the stability of the system. Whether this
favored class was membership in a political party, oligarchy, or
military group, did not matter; the underlying mechanism was the
same. And the result was just as horrifying for the citizens
unfortunate enough to fall under such misrule.

The catalogue of failures in the present market economy is clear;
while many "market fundamentalists" have responded to shortcomings by ardently
wishing them away or dismissing them, there are plenty of more
moderate defenders will instead simply insist that it is the best
mechanism for running an economy that has yet been found. They will do
so by pointing to the nordic countries as having an ideal blend. What
such reformers frequently overlook is that this economy is at best a
happy historical accident, in spite of its obvious merits, it has yet to be
adopted in other countries. Nor is there any sign that it is possible
to keep these merits if every country adopts this model, implying it
only works simply because so few countries have committed to keeping
this path. And there is no working around the fact that this model is
a capitalistic model, albeit one with fewer evident shortcomings.

Meanwhile, failures of democracy are many. Democracy is frequently
refered to as "the worst form of government, except for all the
others." Many of the problems of democracy would seem to be one of
structure. Whether through a presidential or parliamentary system,
democracies through the world have similar problems:
* easy corruption
of the system by entrenched, monied interest;
* the creation of
disconnected beaurocracies that frequently have to ignore the popular
will in the name of "getting something done";
* the formation of elite decision-making bodies that frequently have
neither the skills nor the mandate to defend their decisions against
propaganda by entrenched interests that benefit from the status quo;
* a remarkable vulnerability to corruption and majoritarian abuses of
power due to the repeated ability of socoipathic demagogues to repeatednly get
themselves elected to positions of power, from which they can rig
democratic systems to serve their ends.

So we have two world views that are under seige. With these two world
views, there is a remarkable contrast between these challenges by most
people of good will. With regard to economic fixes, there are many
thinkers able to propose even the most radical of changes to the
economic order. Most of them are wildy impractical, requiring the sort
of massive redistrubution in wealth and resources that only seems to
happen under conditions of world war and failing empire. Yet these
alternatives do exist.

With democracy, the opposite is the case - the fix proposed for
democracy is, generally, "more democracy." And so structural changes,
such as they are, are generally aimed at this level: regulations to
ensure that monied interests do not bankroll candidates and entire
parties, constitutional fixes to make legislative bodies more
representative, and propositions to allow some measure of direct
democracy for issues of importance.

There is an alternative approach, though, that is frequently not
discussed: that something else is needed, besides democracy. Something
besides democracy which still
does not repeat the mistaken abuses of power that brought down those
that democracy replaced, be they monarchical, authoritarian,
totalitarian, oligarchical or otherwise. One reason for this
skepticism of better alternatives may have been the historical nature
of antidemocratic movements; such movements have frequently been
sought by powerful minorities as a way to assert their power over a
majority, or by historically privileged groups to retain this
privelege in the face of public unpopularity. Yet this sort of
antidemocracy need not be the only sort, if there is a vision of
something beyond democracy that seems superior.

Historically, now is the time
for something beyond both market economicas and democracy. But doing
so requires both a quantum leap of faith and imagination. And by
quantum leap, I mean this as a direct analogy - a change which is as
small as possible, but distinct enough as to be qualitatively
different.

This being a Baha'i blog, the question is if the Baha'i Faith has
ideas to lead to the next stage beyond democracy. While there ideas,
the answer is complex. While it does not have a full system, there are
some ideals enshrined in Baha'i law that are worth examining. In many
cases, these ideal are not new, but reflect many of the more
enlightened ideals of the founders of The United States of
America. This is notable, as the founders were steeped in the classic
writings from which the democratic tradition derived ligitimacy.

--------------------------------------------

    Leaders of religion, exponents of political theories, governors of
    human institutions, who at present are witnessing with perplexity
    and dismay the bankruptcy of their ideas, and the disintegration
    of their handiwork, would do well to turn their gaze to the
    Revelation of Baha'u'llah. (Shoghi Effendi, _World Order of
    Baha'u'llah_ 21-Mar-1930).

Before discussing what the Baha'i Faith has to offer in this area,
there are some important caveats that need to be acknowledged. This is
important to prevent overselling how much the Baha'i
Faith can assist.

As indicated, with both economics and politics, the current order is
defective. While the Baha'i Faith has much to say about both, it is
important to note that it is not the primary purpose of the Baha'i
Faith to address those issues. It does address these issues
extensively, only insofar as they serve the purpose of "creating an
ever-advancing civilization." However, the Baha'i Faith cannot be confused with
an economic system, a political system, or even a movement of social
reform, as much as it can contribute to all three areas.

A first point is that the Baha'i Institutions, as they currently
exists, are primary spiritual instatutions for the propagation and
protection of The Faith. As such, they are limited in both the power
and sphere of operation. While this does not mean it is impractical to
look at Baha'i governance and decision-making as I am now doing, it
does mean that certain values and ethical mores may reasonably be
presumed in Baha'i governance that cannot be presumed to exist in
secular political solutions. This means that one cannot will the
existence of certain values habits of behavior without creating
institutions for their inclulation - whereas with any religious
institution, what presumes that these values are present, them being
the entire reason for said religious institution!

For instance, the
fact that elections must take place in an atmosphere of reverent
reflection and prayer is seen as central to governance, but it
requires more elaboration and controls in practice. For an example of
such controls, compare the ban against electioneering in the Baha'i
Faith against ordinances against electioneering at polling booth in
the US; electioneering in Baha'i voting is so unthinkable that
controls are rarely thought of, while in the United States, there are
usually law enforcement officials who will slap handcuffs on you if
you don't stay outside of the orange pylons at the polling booth when
handing out pamphlets. This means we need to cast a more skeptical eye
on practices that could be easy to corrupt due to bad faith and agency
concerns.

Second, and possibly more importantly, is the fact that it is easy to
misread the current development of the institutions of the Faith and
impose it in a fashion reminiscent of old atttempts to establish a
"corporate state," similar to the Catholic Church in the time prior to
Vatican I reform - a unitary merge of State and Religion in which the
Baha'i Faith's own institution of governance, as it _currently
exists_, is the central point of centralized control for this
government. The Baha'i Faith has much to say about government, but it
is a misreading to think that _current_ institutions are anything more
than an embryonic foreshadowing of what may happen in the future. It
is tempting, but probably inappropriate, to use current governance
models of the Baha'i Faith and impose them as a schematic for new
forms of government on the greater world.

The Baha'i Faith anticipates the formation of a world government; it
anticipates the formation over time of an entire world commonwealth;
it even prophecies a golden age in which these two merge. This is quite
explicit in Shoghi Effendi's _World Order of Baha'u'llah_:

    ... as the Baha'i Faith permeates the masses of the peoples of
    East and West, and its truth is embraced by the majority of the
    peoples of a number of the Sovereign States of the world, will the
    Universal House of Justice attain the plenitude of its power, and
    exercise, as the supreme organ of the Baha'i Commonwealth, all the
    rights, the duties, and responsibilities incumbent upon the
    world's future super-state.

Critics have
used this fact to levy against the Faith the charge that what we seek
is a new Caliphate. Baha'is have tended to react by pointing out the
noncoercive nature of Baha'i membership and the democratic mechanism
of elections. What both critics and defenders fail to realize that the
institutions of the Faith themselves are intended to evolve over time;
the current form of Baha'i governance is not in its ideal, finished
state - no more than the present presedential or parliamentary forms
of democratic governance are in its finished state. Shoghi Effendi
explicitly indicates that the primary difference between these rests
is the fact that it is explicitly outlined by our Prophet and Founder
Baha'u'llah, but such an argument is unlikely to convince a
skeptic. The other primary difference he gives may be more meaningful:

    ... whatever is deemed necessary to incorporate into it in order
    to keep it in the forefront of all progressive movements, can,
    according to the provisions made by Baha'u'llah, be safely
    embodied therein. To this testify the words of Baha'u'llah, as
    recorded in the Eighth Leaf of the exalted Paradise: "It is
    incumbent upon the Trustees of the House of Justice to take
    counsel together regarding those things which have not outwardly
    been revealed in the Book, and to enforce that which is agreeable
    to them. God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He willeth,
    and He, verily, is the Provider, the Omniscient." Not only has the
    House of Justice been invested by Baha'u'llah with the authority
    to legislate whatsoever has not been explicitly and outwardly
    recorded in His holy Writ, upon it has also been conferred by the
    Will and Testament of Abdu'l-Baha the right and power to abrogate,
    according to the changes and requirements of the time, whatever
    has been already enacted and enforced by a preceding House of
    Justice. (21-Mar-1930)

That is, because the law and structure of the governance is not laid
down, it is possible to make whatever changes to administrative
structure that is required going forward. Very importantly, it implies
that decisions made are never final, and prior decision is never truly
binding. This implies a level of dynamism that many believers may not be aware
of. Again, Shoghi Effendi:

    Not only will the present-day Spiritual Assemblies be styled
    differently in future, but they will be enabled also to add
    to their present functions those powers, duties, and prerogatives
    necessitated by the recognition of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, not
    merely as one of the recognized religious systems of the world,
    but as the State Religion of an independent and Sovereign Power.
    (27-Feb-1929)

And similarly with regard to the institutions of that time:

    ... the whole machinery of assemblies, of committees and
    conventions is to be regarded as a means, and not an end in
    itself; that they will rise or fall according to their capacity to
    further the interests, to coordinate the activities, to apply the
    principles, to embody the ideals and execute the purpose of the
    Baha'i Faith.

While this was written in 1929, Baha'is will readly admit that this
quote covers the present-day orders of the Baha'i Faith with equal accuracy.

Unfortunately, some of the wrongheaded criticism of Baha'i
institutions and Baha'i governance has actually come from influential
academics inside the Faith working with outsiders, to change things
more to their liking. Such critics have posed "reforms" intended to
fix what they perceive as deficiencies in the present Baha'i
administrative order. Inevitably, these reforms are all things
borrowing from present-day secular governance, things such as
nominations, guarantees of separation of church and state, and various
other things. Many Baha'i defenders were quick to reject these, seeing
that much of this was caused by a desire to get Baha'i institutions to
conform to civic best-practices. As stated by the Guardian:

    Let us be on our guard lest we measure too strictly the Divine
    Plan with the standard of men. I am not prepared to state that it
    agrees in principle or in method with the prevailing notions now
    uppermost in men's minds, nor that it should conform with those
    imperfect, precarious, and expedient measures feverishly resorted
    to by agitated humanity. (BA )

However, not
all of the defenders had the awareness to point out that the institutions of
the Baha'i Faith are hardly and an ideal state themselves, nor should
they be expected to be. Perhaps some Baha'is are offended by the idea
of "reform," as they may think it implies the fact the Baha'i Faith is
imperfect. But in fact, the institutions are themselves not finished,
and as such; they are "reformed" every time a change is introduced,
such as Area Teaching committees or Regional councils. Talking about
"reform" is only a problem when such a campaign is carried out in an
orchestrated manner with help from parties outside of the Baha'i
Faith, particularly when such efforts bypass existing channels for
suggesting change.

The caveat, therefore, is that what the Baha'i Faith has to offer to
the world are not structural reforms, or reforms in the nature of
mechanics of elections, separations of power and the like; many of
these mechanics may be subject to further abrogation and changes.
Instead, what it has to offer at this point are principles. We know
based on the writings that however the Administrative Order may
evolve, there are certain principles that it must conform with. It is
mainly these principles that can be used to evolve the next step in
the life of secular institutions.

Many of the ground principles of Baha'i governance are laid forth in
Shoghi Effendi's _World Order of Baha'u'llah_. Summarized among them
are the following:

    The concentration of authority in the hands of the elected
    representatives of the believers; the necessity of the submission
    of every adherent of the Faith to the considered judgment of
    Baha'i Assemblies; His preference for unanimity in decision; the
    decisive character of the majority vote; and even the desirability
    for the exercise of close supervision over all Baha'i
    publications, have been sedulously instilled by Abdu'l-Baha, as
    evidenced by His authenticated and widely-scattered Tablets. (27-Feb-1929)



To this end, there are several principles that the Baha'i Faith would
have to recommend for the evolution of secular governance. An
incomplete list would include the following:

1. Elimination of partisan politics
2. Emphasis on smaller legislative units aiming toward consensus decisions
2. Re-emphasis on federalism and decentralization as a governing
principle
3. Emphasis on "republican" principle of leadership by representatives
4. Limited transparency in deliberations
4. Emphasis on universal participation in politics
5. Improved participation by individuals in matters of governance
6. Proper education in civic virtues
7. Indirect election of higher-level offices


All of these should be easily recognizable to Baha'is. Ironically,
many of these have their antecedents in recommendations by the
"founding fathers" of the US. As Baha'is, we are well aware of the
flaws of many of the historical figures that founded the United
States; for some, the accomidation made by such figures with slavery
makes makes any recommendations by such figures immediately
suspect. However, we should not overlook the reverence with which many
US Citizens hold such figures. If we can use their arguments to
advance the ways in which the Baha'i Faith can improve our own civic
governance, we should do so.

Let's go through these recommendations one at a time.

---------------------------------

    The Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah must in no
    wise be regarded as purely democratic in character inasmuch as the
    basic assumption which requires all democracies to depend
    fundamentally upon getting their mandate from the people is
    altogether lacking in this Dispensation. In the conduct of the
    administrative affairs of the Faith, in the enactment of the
    legislation necessary to supplement the laws of the Kitab-i-Aqdas,
    the members of the Universal House of Justice, it should be borne
    in mind, are not, as Baha'u'llah's utterances clearly imply,
    responsible to those whom they represent, nor are they allowed to
    be governed by the feelings, the general opinion, and even the
    convictions of the mass of the faithful, or of those who directly
    elect them. They are to follow, in a prayerful attitude, the
    dictates and promptings of their conscience. They may, indeed they
    must, acquaint themselves with the conditions prevailing among the
    community, must weigh dispassionately in their minds the merits of
    any case presented for their consideration, but must reserve for
    themselves the right of an unfettered decision. (WOB 8-Feb-1934)

    And now, concerning the House of Justice which God hath ordained
    as the source of all good and freed from all error, it must be
    elected by universal suffrage, that is, by the believers. Its
    members must be manifestations of the fear of God and daysprings
    of knowledge and understanding, must be steadfast in God's faith
    and the well-wishers of all mankind. By this House is meant the
    Universal House of Justice, that is, in all countries, a secondary
    House of Justice must be instituted, and these secondary Houses of
    Justice must elect the members of the Universal one. Unto this
    body all things must be referred. It enacteth all ordinances and
    regulations that are not to be found in the explicit Holy Text. (WTAB)

    [In order to avoid division and disruption, that the Cause may not
    fall a prey to conflicting interpretations, and lose thereby its
    purity and pristine vigor, that its affairs may be conducted with
    efficiency and promptness], it is necessary that every one should
    conscientiously take an active part in the election of these
    Assemblies, abide by their decisions, enforce their decree, and
    cooperate with them wholeheartedly in their task of stimulating
    the growth of the Movement throughout all regions. The members of
    these Assemblies, on their part, must disregard utterly their own
    likes and dislikes, their personal interests and inclinations, and
    concentrate their minds upon those measures that will conduce to
    the welfare and happiness of the Baha'i Community and promote the
    common weal. (BA 12-Mar-1923)

    Let us also remember that at the very root of the Cause lies the
    principle of the undoubted right of the individual to
    self-expression, his freedom to declare his conscience and set
    forth his views. (BA 23-Feb-1924)

    Their function [elected representatives] is not to dictate, but to
    consult, and consult not only among themselves, but as much as
    possible with the friends whom they represent. They must regard
    themselves in no other light but that of chosen instruments for a
    more efficient and dignified presentation of the Cause of
    God. They should never be led to suppose that they are the central
    ornaments of the body of the Cause, intrinsically superior to
    others in capacity or merit, and sole promoters of its teachings
    and principles. They should approach their task with extreme
    humility, and endeavor, by their open-mindedness, their high sense
    of justice and duty, their candor, their modesty, their entire
    devotion to the welfare and interests of the friends, the Cause,
    and humanity, to win, not only the confidence and the genuine
    support and respect of those whom they serve, but also their
    esteem and real affection. They must, at all times, avoid the
    spirit of exclusiveness, the atmosphere of secrecy, free
    themselves from a domineering attitude, and banish all forms of
    prejudice and passion from their deliberations. They should,
    within the limits of wise discretion, take the friends into their
    confidence, acquaint them with their plans, share with them their
    problems and anxieties, and seek their advice and counsel. And,
    when they are called upon to arrive at a certain decision, they
    should, after dispassionate, anxious and cordial consultation,
    turn to God in prayer, and with earnestness and conviction and
    courage record their vote and abide by the voice of the majority,
    which we are told by our Master to be the voice of truth, never to
    be challenged, and always to be whole-heartedly enforced. To this
    voice the friends must heartily respond, and regard it as the only
    means that can insure the protection and advancement of the
    Cause. (BA 23-Feb-1924)

    In one of His earliest Tablets, however, addressed to a friend in
    Persia, the following is expressly recorded: --

	"At whatever time all the beloved of God in each country
	appoint their delegates, and these in turn elect their
	representatives, and these representatives elect a body, that
	body shall be regarded as the Supreme Baytu'l-'Adl (Universal
	House of Justice)."

    These words clearly indicate that a three-stage election has been
    provided by Abdu'l-Baha for the formation of the International
    House of Justice, and as it is explicitly provided in His Will and
    Testament that the "Secondary House of Justice (i.e., National
    Assemblies) must elect the members of the Universal One," it is
    obvious that the members of the National Spiritual Assemblies will
    have to be indirectly elected by the body of the believers in
    their respective provinces.

    Should the appointing of the delegates be made a part of the
    functions of local Spiritual Assemblies, who are already elected
    bodies, the principle of a four-stage election would be introduced
    which would be at variance with the provisions explicitly laid
    down in the Master's Tablet. On the other hand, were the local
    Spiritual Assemblies, the number of whose members is strictly
    confined to <p85> nine, to elect directly the members of the
    National Spiritual Assembly -- thus maintaining the principle of a
    three-stage election -- all Baha'i localities, which must
    necessarily differ in numerical strength, would then have to share
    equally in the election of the National Spiritual Assembly -- a
    practice which would be contrary to fairness and
    justice. Moreover, the central principle guiding for the present
    the administration of the Cause has been to make the Baha'i
    National Spiritual Assemblies as independent as possible in the
    conduct of such affairs as fall within their province, and to
    lessen the hampering influence of any institution within their
    jurisdiction that might, whether directly or indirectly, impair
    their authority and prestige. (BA 12-May-1925)

    ... it is incumbent upon the chosen delegates to consider without
    the least trace of passion and prejudice, and irrespective of any
    material consideration, the names of only those who can best
    combine the necessary qualities of unquestioned loyalty, of
    selfless devotion, of a well-trained mind, of recognized ability
    and mature experience. (BA 3-Jun-1925)

    I have consequently refrained from establishing a settled and
    uniform procedure for the election of the Assemblies of the East
    and the West, leaving them free to pursue their own methods of
    procedure which in most cases had been instituted and practiced
    during the last two decades of the life of Abdu'l-Baha.

    The general practice prevailing throughout the East is the one
    based upon the principle of plurality rather than absolute
    majority, whereby those candidates that have obtained the highest
    number of votes, irrespective of the fact whether they command an
    absolute majority of the votes cast or not, are automatically and
    definitely elected. It has been felt, with no little
    justification, that this method, admittedly disadvantageous in its
    disregard of the principle that requires that each elected member
    must secure a majority of the votes cast, does away on the other
    hand with the more serious disadvantage of restricting the freedom
    of the elector who, unhampered and unconstrained by electoral
    necessities, is called upon to vote for none but those whom prayer
    and reflection have inspired him to uphold. Moreover, the practice
    of nomination, so detrimental to the atmosphere of a silent and
    prayerful election, is viewed with mistrust inasmuch as it gives
    the right to the majority of a body that, in itself under the
    present circumstances, often constitutes a minority of all the
    elected delegates, to deny that God-given right of every elector
    to vote only in favor of those who he is conscientiously convinced
    are the most worthy candidates. Should this simple system be
    provisionally adopted, it would safeguard the spiritual principle
    of the unfettered freedom of the voter, who will thus preserve
    intact the sanctity of the choice he first made. It would avoid
    the inconvenience of securing advance nominations from absent
    delegates, and the impracticality of associating them with the
    assembled electors in the subsequent ballots that are often
    required to meet the exigencies of majority vote.

    I would recommend these observations to your earnest
    consideration, and whatever decision you arrive at, all local
    Assemblies and individual believers, I am certain, will uphold,
    for their spiritual obligation and privilege is not only to
    consult freely and frequently with the National Spiritual
    Assembly, but to uphold as well with <p137> confidence and
    cheerfulness whatever is the considered verdict of their national
    representatives. (BA 27-May-1926)

    They should, within the limits imposed upon them by present-day
    circumstances, endeavor to maintain the balance in such a manner
    that the evils of over-centralization which clog, confuse and in
    the long run depreciate the value of the Baha'i services rendered
    shall on one hand be entirely avoided, and on the other the perils
    of utter decentralization with the consequent lapse of governing
    authority from the hands of the national representatives of the
    believers definitely averted. The absorption of the petty details
    of Baha'i administration by the personnel of the National
    Spiritual Assembly is manifestly injurious to efficiency and an
    expert discharge of Baha'i duties, whilst the granting of undue
    discretion to bodies that should be regarded in no other light
    than that of expert advisers and executive assistants would
    jeopardize the very vital and pervading powers that are the sacred
    prerogatives of bodies that in time will evolve into Baha'i
    National Houses of Justice. (BA 18-Oct-1927)

    Let it be made clear to every inquiring reader that among the most
    outstanding and sacred duties incumbent upon those who have been
    called upon to initiate, direct and coordinate the affairs of the
    Cause, are those that require them to win by every means in their
    power the confidence and affection of those whom it is their
    privilege to serve. Theirs is the duty to investigate and acquaint
    themselves with the considered views, the prevailing sentiments,
    the personal convictions of those whose welfare it is their solemn
    obligation to promote. Theirs is the duty to purge once for all
    their deliberations and the general conduct of their affairs from
    that air of self-contained aloofness, from the suspicion of
    secrecy, the stifling atmosphere of dictatorial assertiveness, in
    short, from every word and deed that might savor of partiality,
    self-centeredness and prejudice. Theirs is the duty, while
    retaining the sacred and exclusive right of final decision in
    their hands, to invite discussion, provide information, ventilate
    <p144> grievances, welcome advice from even the most humble and
    insignificant members of the Baha'i family, expose their motives,
    set forth their plans, justify their actions, revise if necessary
    their verdict, foster the spirit of individual initiative and
    enterprise, and fortify the sense of interdependence and
    co-partnership, of understanding and mutual confidence between
    them on one hand and all local Assemblies and individual believers
    on the other. (BA 18-Oct-1927)

-------------------------------

    How pathetic indeed are the efforts of those leaders of human
    institutions who, in utter disregard of the spirit of the age, are
    striving to adjust national processes, suited to the ancient days
    of self-contained nations, to an age which must either achieve the
    unity of the world, as adumbrated by Baha'u'llah, or perish. At so
    critical an hour in the history of civilization it behooves the
    leaders of all the nations of the world, great and small, whether
    in the East or in the West, whether victors or vanquished, to give
    heed to the clarion call of Baha'u'llah and, thoroughly imbued
    with a sense of <p37> world solidarity, the sine qua non of
    loyalty to His Cause, arise manfully to carry out in its entirety
    the one remedial scheme He, the Divine Physician, has prescribed
    for an ailing humanity. (WOB 28-Nov-1931)

    The call of Baha'u'llah is primarily directed against all forms of
    provincialism, all insularities and prejudices. If long-cherished
    ideals and time-honored institutions, if certain social
    assumptions and religious formulae have ceased to promote the
    welfare of the generality of mankind, if they no longer minister
    to the needs of a continually evolving humanity, let them be swept
    away and relegated to the limbo of obsolescent and forgotten
    doctrines. Why should these, in a world subject to the immutable
    law of change and decay, be exempt from the deterioration that
    must needs overtake every human institution? For legal standards,
    political and economic theories are solely designed to safeguard
    the interests of humanity as a whole, and not humanity to be
    crucified for the preservation of the integrity of any particular
    law or doctrine. (WOB 28-Nov-1931)

    The principle of the Oneness of Mankind -- the pivot round which
    all the teachings of Baha'u'llah revolve <p43> -- is no mere
    outburst of ignorant emotionalism or an expression of vague and
    pious hope... It does not constitute merely the enunciation of an
    ideal, but stands inseparably associated with an institution
    adequate to embody its truth, demonstrate its validity, and
    perpetuate its influence. It implies an organic change in the
    structure of present-day society, a change such as the world has
    not yet experienced. It constitutes a challenge, at once bold and
    universal, to outworn shibboleths of national creeds -- creeds
    that have had their day and which must, in the ordinary course of
    events as shaped and controlled by Providence, give way to a new
    gospel, fundamentally different from, and infinitely superior to,
    what the world has already conceived. It calls for no less than
    the reconstruction and the demilitarization of the whole civilized
    world -- a world organically unified in all the essential aspects
    of its life, its political machinery, its spiritual aspiration,
    its trade and finance, its script and language, and yet infinite
    in the diversity of the national characteristics of its federated
    units. (WOB 28-Nov-1931)

    Their common, their fundamental object is to insure the continuity
    of that divinely-appointed authority which flows from the Source
    of our Faith, to safeguard the unity of its followers and to
    maintain the integrity and flexibility of its teachings. Acting in
    conjunction with each other these two inseparable institutions
    administer its affairs, coordinate its activities, promote its
    interests, execute its laws and defend its subsidiary
    institutions.  (WOB 8-Feb-1934)

    This new-born Administrative Order incorporates within its
    structure certain elements which are to be found in each of the
    three recognized forms of secular government [democracy,
    autocracy/dictatorship/monarchy, aristocy/oligarchy;
    cross-reference to Aristotle's three types], without being in any
    sense a mere replica of any one of them, and without introducing
    within its machinery any of the objectionable features which they
    inherently possess. It blends and harmonizes, as no government
    fashioned by mortal hands has as yet accomplished, the salutary
    truths which each of these systems undoubtedly contains <p153>
    without vitiating the integrity of those God-given verities on
    which it is ultimately founded. (WOB 8-Feb-1934)

A parallel might almost be drawn between these confused and confusing systems of thought that are the direct outcome of the helplessness and confusion afflicting the Christian Faith and the great variety of popular cults, of fashionable and evasive philosophies which flourished in the opening centuries of the Christian Era, and which attempted to absorb and pervert the state religion of that Roman people. The pagan worshipers who constituted, at that time, the bulk of the population of the Western Roman Empire, found themselves surrounded, and in certain instances menaced, by the prevailing sect of the Neo-Platonists, by the followers of nature religions, by Gnostic philosophers, by Philonism, Mithraism, the adherents of the Alexandrian cult, and a multitude of kindred sects <p185> and beliefs, in much the same way as the defenders of the Christian Faith, the preponderating religion of the western world, are realizing, in the first century of the Baha'i Era, how their influence is being undermined by a flood of conflicting beliefs, practices and tendencies which their own bankruptcy had helped to create. It was, however, this same Christian Religion, which has now fallen into such a state of impotence, that eventually proved itself capable of sweeping away the institutions of paganism and of swamping and suppressing the cults that had flourished in that age. 

	Such institutions as have strayed far from the spirit and
	teachings of Jesus Christ must of necessity, as the embryonic
	World Order of Baha'u'llah takes shape and unfolds, recede
	into the background, and make way for the progress of the
	divinely-ordained institutions that stand inextricably
	interwoven with His teachings. The indwelling Spirit of God
	which, in the Apostolic Age of the Church, animated its
	members, the pristine purity of its teachings, the primitive
	brilliancy of its light, will, no doubt, be reborn and revived
	as the inevitable consequence of this redefinition of its
	fundamental verities, and the clarification of its original
	purpose. (WOB 11-Mar-1936)

    ... the dignity and unity of the Cause urgently demands --
    particularly throughout the American continent -- that the friends
    should in their words and conduct emphasize and give absolute
    prominence to the constructive dynamic principles of Baha'u'llah,
    rather than attach undue importance to His negative Teachings. (BA
    5-Mar-1922)

    [regarding the continued necessity of publication review]
    So great
    is the importance and so supreme is the authority of these
    assemblies that once Abdu'l-Baha after having himself and in his
    own handwriting corrected the translation made into Arabic of the
    Ishraqat (the Effulgences) by Sheikh Faraj, a Kurdish friend from
    Cairo, directed him in a Tablet to submit the above-named
    translation to the Spiritual Assembly of Cairo, that he may seek
    from them before publication their approval and consent. These are
    His very words in that Tablet: -- "His honor, Sheikh Faraju'llah,
    has here rendered into Arabic with greatest care the Ishraqat and
    yet I have told him that he must submit his version to the
    Spiritual Assembly of Egypt, and I have conditioned its
    publication upon the approval of the above-named Assembly. This is
    so that things may be arranged in an orderly manner, for should it
    not be so any one may translate a certain Tablet and print and
    circulate it on his own account. Even a non-believer might
    undertake such work, and thus cause confusion and disorder. If it
    be conditioned, however, upon the approval of the Spiritual
    Assembly, a translation prepared, printed and circulated by a
    non-believer will have no recognition whatever.

    This is indeed a clear indication of the Master's express desire
    that nothing whatever should be given to the public by any
    individual among the friends, unless fully considered and approved
    by the Spiritual Assembly in his locality; and if this (as is
    undoubtedly the case) is a matter that pertains to the general
    interest of the Cause in that land, then it is incumbent upon the
    Spiritual Assembly to submit it to the consideration and approval
    of the national body representing all the various local
    assemblies. (BA 5-Mar-1922)


Adjunct Texts (from _Baha'i Administration_)

	Duties of Spiritual Assemblies

	The matter of Teaching, its direction, its ways and means, its extension, its consolidation, essential as they are to the interests of the Cause, constitute by no means the only issue which should <p38> receive the full attention of these Assemblies. A careful study of Baha'u'llah's and Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets will reveal that other duties, no less vital to the interests of the Cause, devolve upon the elected representatives of the friends in every locality. 

	It is incumbent upon them to be vigilant and cautious, discreet and watchful, and protect at all times the Temple of the Cause from the dart of the mischief-maker and the onslaught of the enemy. 

	They must endeavor to promote amity and concord amongst the friends, efface every lingering trace of distrust, coolness and estrangement from every heart, and secure in its stead an active and whole-hearted cooperation for the service of the Cause. 

	They must do their utmost to extend at all times the helping hand to the poor, the sick, the disabled, the orphan, the widow, irrespective of color, caste and creed. 

	They must promote by every means in their power the material as well as the spiritual enlightenment of youth, the means for the education of children, institute, whenever possible, Baha'i educational institutions, organize and supervise their work and provide the best means for their progress and development. 

	They must make an effort to maintain official, regular, and frequent correspondence with the various Baha'i centers throughout the world, report to them their activities, and share the glad-tidings they receive with all their fellow-workers in the Cause. 

	They must encourage and stimulate by every means at their command, through subscription, reports and articles, the development of the various Baha'i magazines, such as the "Star of the West" and the "Magazine of the Children of the Kingdom" in the United States of America, the " Baha'i News" of India, the "Sun of the East" (Khurshid-i Khavar) in Turkestan, the "Star of the East" in Japan, the "Sun of Truth" in Germany. 

	They must undertake the arrangement of the regular meetings of the friends, the feasts and the anniversaries, as well as the special gatherings designed to serve and promote the social, intellectual and spiritual interests of their fellow-men. 

	They must supervise in these days when the Cause is still in its infancy all Baha'i publications and translations, and provide in general for a dignified and accurate presentation of all Baha'i literature and its distribution to the general public. <p39> 

	These rank among the most outstanding obligations of the members of every Spiritual Assembly. In whatsoever locality the Cause has sufficiently expanded, and in order to insure efficiency and avoid confusion, each of these manifold functions will have to be referred to a special Committee, responsible to that Assembly, elected by it from among the friends in that locality, and upon whose work the Assembly will have to exercise constant and general supervision. 

	These local Spiritual Assemblies will have to be elected directly by the friends, and every declared believer of 21 years and above, far from standing aloof and assuming an indifferent or independent attitude, should regard it his sacred duty to take part conscientiously and diligently, in the election, the consolidation and the efficient working of his own local Assembly.

	National Assemblies

	Regarding the establishment of "National Assemblies," it is of vital importance that in every country, where the conditions are favorable and the number of the friends has grown and reached a considerable size, such as America, Great Britain and Germany, that a "National Spiritual Assembly" be immediately established, representative of the friends throughout that country. 

	Its immediate purpose is to stimulate, unify and coordinate by frequent personal consultations, the manifold activities of the friends as well as the local Assemblies; and by keeping in close and constant touch with the Holy Land, initiate measures, and direct in general the affairs of the Cause in that country. 

	It serves also another purpose, no less essential than the first, as in the course of time it shall evolve into the National House of Justice (referred to in Abdu'l-Baha's Will as the "secondary House of Justice"), which according to the explicit text of the Testament will have, in conjunction with the other National Assemblies throughout the Baha'i world, to elect directly the members of the International House of Justice, that Supreme Council that will guide, organize and unify the affairs of the Movement throughout the world. 

	It is expressly recorded in Abdu'l-Baha's Writings that these National Assemblies must be indirectly elected by the friends; that <p40> is, the friends in every country must elect a certain number of delegates, who in their turn will elect from among all the friends in that country the members of the National Spiritual Assembly. In such countries, therefore, as America, Great Britain and Germany, a fixed number of secondary electors must first be decided upon (95 for America, including the Pacific Islands; 95 for Germany; and 19 for Great Britain). The friends then in every locality where the number of adult declared believers exceeds nine must directly elect its quota of secondary electors assigned to it in direct proportion to its numerical strength. These secondary electors will then, either through correspondence, or preferably by gathering together, and first deliberating upon the affairs of the Cause throughout their country (as the delegates to the Convention), elect from among all the friends in that country nine who will be the members of the National Spiritual Assembly. 

	This National Spiritual Assembly, which, pending the establishment of the Universal House of Justice, will have to be re-elected once a year, obviously assumes grave responsibilities, for it has to exercise full authority over all the local Assemblies in its province, and will have to direct the activities of the friends, guard vigilantly the Cause of God, and control and supervise the affairs of the Movement in general. 

	Vital issues, affecting the interests of the Cause in that country such as the matter of translation and publication, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, the Teaching Work, and other similar matters that stand distinct from strictly local affairs, must be under the full jurisdiction of the National Assembly. 

	It will have to refer each of these questions, even as the local Assemblies, to a special Committee, to be elected by the members of the National Spiritual Assembly, from among all the friends in that country, which will bear to it the same relation as the local committees bear to their respective local Assemblies. 

	With it, too, rests the decision whether a certain point at issue is strictly local in its nature, and should be reserved for the consideration and decision of the local Assembly, or whether it should fall under its own province and be regarded as a matter which ought to receive its special attention. The National Spiritual Assembly will also decide upon such matters which in its opinion <p41> should be referred to the Holy Land for consultation and decision. 

	With these Assemblies, local as well as national, harmoniously, vigorously, and efficiently functioning throughout the Baha'i world, the only means for the establishment of the Supreme House of Justice will have been secured. And when this Supreme Body will have been properly established, it will have to consider afresh the whole situation, and lay down the principle which shall direct, so long as it deems advisable, the affairs of the Cause.
