So about my prior column...

Partly it was to vent. But partly because it is mathematically
fun. And gives me a chance to explain to myself why things never
worked out properly.

I got married, like a lot of other peole who won't disclose it,
through a computer dating website. I used them pretty heavily during
2002-2005. I actually attempted in 1999-2000 very unsuccessfully; at
the time the market was very fragmented and _very_
male-dominated. Many of the websites were full of false profiles. In
some cases, it was obviously a ploy to get men to pay for the website.
"User PrettyModel09 wants to talk to you. To chat, *click here* to
sign up and unlcok this feature." But even if you did pay (and I made
that mistake once, the odds were against meeting in person, even with
hours of effort. One site was stupid enough to actually post publicly
statistics on whose profile was getting responses (if you knew where
to look). Poking around, I was anguished to find that if your profile
indicated you were above 5'10" and made over $100,000, you had a 50%
chance of your messages getting returned. My return rate was perhaps 3%.

However, something happened in 2002, and for whatever reason, single
professional women in their late twenties and early thirties started
giving them a whirl. I heavily used a site associated with
_Time_Out_New_York_; the questions themselves serve to filter out
anyone emptyheaded ("What is the last really good book you read?"
"Name 5 CDs you play when you're in the mood", etc.) The women I met
through that website were interesting, literate, educated, fun to talk
to, generally good-looking, and _extremely_ hard to get. In short,
what you imagine a "New York single" to be like. The other was the
ubiquitous Match.com. That site was (and probably still is) full of
modest thirtysomething women whose dream was to get married and move
out to the suburbs. I found someone who I found unusually attractive
and whose dreams I could relate to a little more than that typical
"picket fence" stuff. I later married her. But unfortunately, I now
live in the suburbs.

In any event, I actually didn't expect this to work. Being what I
referred to in my earlier post as a "beta," I knew my strategy had to
be an "all of the above" strategy - I had to get my numbers up or I
would die a never-married. I had few friends and they weren't doing
any better than I, so I couldn't count on setups. That meant the usual
suspects - meetups, religious groups, dance lessons, that sort of
thing.

In general, my numbers from there were really horrible. And it seemed
a lot of other people weren't doing much better. However, at the time
I didn't know much probability, and in spite of my background, not
much about mathematical modeling. Had I bothered to do some, I would
have figured part of the problem. This doesn't mean it wasn't worth
doing those activites. But had I done the math, I would know what I
was up against.

One was gender imbalance - no matter what group I was in, it always
seemed to have more guys than women. Even in New York, that was the
case. Naturally, women reported the same thing for _themselves_. Why
would it be the case? Wouldn't you have a 50/50 split most of the
time? And even if you didn't, would you have just as great an odds
being in one where the split was in your favor?

There is an answer! I can't tell you exactly what to do about it,
though I can give you a hint what to avoid.

There are two things working against you:

1. The binomial distribution
2. Bayes' theorem.

*The problem with the Binomial Distribution*

The binomial distribution is the probability distribution when you
flip a coin. If you flip a coin, you get a bunch of heads and a bunch
of tails. You probably did the exercise in middle school where you
flipped the coin again and again. The more times you flipped, the
closer you got to 50%.

However, they don't tell you what happens if you flip only a few
times. Or 10 or 20 times.

As it turns out, a binomial distribution will start to approach
something called a _normal curve_ somewhere around 30 flips. The
normal curve is the one everyone uses in statistics. The normal curve
follows certain rules for variances and so forth. If you flip the coin
30 times, it will start looking like a standard distribution, with a
standard deviation of 
sqrt(30 * 0.5 * 0.5) = 2.7
This means that you have about a 65% chance of the split being no
worse than 17-13 either way, and 95% chance of the split being no
worse than 20-10.

If you look at it, that ain't great.

So think of your social group. How big is it? If it's a very "close"
group, you might have perhaps 50, or even 100 people who are often
involved. But usually the regulars boil down to a much smaller set;
perhaps a subset of ten to twenty-five.

So this can lead to a more lopsided distribution. For perhaps 15
people, as you might guess, it is MORE likely that you'll get a
lopsided distribution than one that is even. An "even" distribution is
8-7 or 9-6, but given that this has a standard deviation of 2, it's
probably more likely than not that the ration is 10-5 or worse. Hardly
enough to encourage pairing off. This is discouraging to someone doing
social direction of youth programs, who might be juggling 20 or 25
"regulars"; at any given event, you'll have what appears to be a
lopsided distribution purely based on random chance.

If you yourself are a "regular", the odds are more challenging because
Bayes' law comes into play. What is the essence of Bayes' law? It's
conditional probability - the fact that YOU are in a group. Let's look
at it this way:

Suppose you are a set of regulars that frequent a bar, meetup, or
what-have-you. There happen to be a little under 100 people
participating with a 50/50 split. Perfect, right? Your regular
meetings draw a crowd of around15. If you are a female, odds are, there will be
slightly more females than guys because YOUR PRESENCE is enough to
throw off the sample. A group of 15 people will, on average, consist
of 7.5 males and 7.5 females; once you throw yourself in there, the
average is 7 males and 8 females. Combine this with a binomial
distribution with a small number of samples, and a lot of meetings are
going to look like "girls' night out". This isn't a pure binomial,
in that you are doing "draw without replacement," but at 100 people it
is close enough. A pure binomial distribution of the meetings you show
up at would produce the following:
* about a 60% chance of more women than men
* about a 10% chance of having women outnumber men by 2 to 1
* just a 3% chance of having men outnumber women by 2 to 1.
Look on the bright sight - at least you won't face a "sausage fest."

Of course, in practice, you will tend to draw regulars more often than
not. And these regulars will not pair up, more often than not. If it's
a church group or social group that is supposed to do that explicitly,
then people can wonder, but again, math is what is going on here, not
people's bad attitudes.

The people who plan these things tend to think - just throw together
an even number of men and women. It will happen naturally, right?
Well, there are two problems. One is the fact that groups tend to be
unbalanced, which doesn't lead to coupling off. But the other is the
distribution of the types of people involved in these activities. As
you can see, unbalanced outings are the norm.

And if you manage to get large groups, you wind up with the "cocktail
party" effect. No, not the one about picking out conversations in
crowds. No, it has to do with pairing off too. The ideal goal of a
host for such a thing is to ensure everyone has a good time. And a
good time can be had by all, provided everyone is socially mature and
thoughtful (don't laugh, it happens). But pairing off? In a large
group, the pairing off happens among people who really don't need help
pairing off.

Let's look at how a party of fortysomething people might break
down. On average you'll going to have a mismatch - you need a LOT of
people to get to the point where you'll have a 50/50 split - but at
least if you have this many, if it's truly lopsided it's probably not
chance. So, plenty of opportunities for everyone, right?

Well... let's think of what happens. Let's presume a typical "New
York" crowd of twenty/thirty-somethings. You have a fair number of
charming, friendly women you'd consider attractive - enough so that most guys would be
interested. The "alphas". (Again, this isn't about looks, it's about
this person's experience dating, which is all about how easy it is to
get someone interested in them romantically). You have perhaps an
equal number of men in that group. Then maybe up to half are of
average desireability, the "betas." The remainder have their work cut
out for them. How is this going to break down?

We can pull some random, good-sounding numbers out of a hat as a rough
model. Perhaps there are 20 single women; 7 of them are attractive
enough that most guys are interested - say 2 in 3. 10 of them have perhaps a 1
in 3 chance of pulling in interest. And you have 22 single
guys. Suppose 5 of them are tall and reasonably good looking - about 1
in 2 of the women at the party would be interested. And another 10 are
meh. Perhaps 1 in 5 of the women at the party are interested. How is
this going to work out?

Your thought is that "well, the alphas will hook up with the alphas,
and the betas with the betas." It doesn't really work that way. If you
_force_ someone to "pick one" - and they've done these experiments -
you get a rather exasperating effect, if you're a social
director. Basically, the most attractive woman hooks up with the most
attractive man, the second most attractive women hooks up with the
second most attractive man, all the way down the line. Every time!
Over a more extensive period this effect goes away, but barring
anything requiring people to get to know another more deeply, you're
stuck with human nature. So
much for the exhaustive planning of your social coordinator.

But in real life, people aren't forced to pair off. You see someone
you fancy, and if you do, great! But if you don't, you aren't going to
force your company on someone when neither of you have the slightest
interest in one another - you simply won't hit it off. So what is
going to happen? Well, it's not necessarily true that people will pair
alpha with alpha.

But what happens? You need _mutual_ attraction. And look at the odds -
it is *much* more likely that you will have mutual attraction between
two alphas than two betas. Worse yet for the betas who are left over -
an alpha-beta pairing is more likely than a beta-beta pairing,
provided such a pairing is available.

So let's look at this:
7 Alpha women: there will be 
  7 * .666 * .5 * 5 = 15(!) potential pairings with alpha guys
  7 * .666 * .2 * 10 = 10 potential pairings with betas
10 Beta women: will be a
  10 * .3 * .5 * 5 = 7 potential pairings with alpha men
  10 * .3 * .2 * 10 = 6 potential pairings with beta men.
Add this up: alpha women have an average of 3.5 potential suitors;
alpha men have an average of 4.4 potential suitors; beta women an
average of 1.3 suitors; beta men an average of 1.6 suitors.

This is about a factor of 3 right? Not *that* bad, right? Here's the
problem: almost all of the pairings involve at least one alpha - by a
factor of over 4 to 5! If you stick with beta-beta pairings, you'll
only have 6, versus 32 otherwise. Think about it: if you had just
those 20 "average" people at this mixer, almost half will not hit it
off with _anyone_. Contrariwise, the presence of the alphas makes
possible 17 additional pairings with these betas.

What does this weird little model tell us, then? Well, it tells us why
setups rarely worked. In general, people are going to fix up friends
who have trouble getting dates - the above-named betas. Looks like if
you set your friend up on 10 dates, you'll have about an even chance
at least ONE will lead to a second date. Ouch.

It also tells us why guys tend to ask "up." Why? It isn't as if they
have better odds. Instead, you're going ask out who you're attracted
to. Remember, the betas aren't unattractive - they're simply
attractive to fewer people.

It also tells us it doesn't matter who's being "picky"; the men or
women. I pulled these numbers entirely out of the air, and made the
women pickier just because that's my experience, but if I swapped
numbers for the genders, you'd still get the same pairings. If you
like someone and they don't like you back, how is that any better than
for you than just not liking someone in the first place?

And finally, this analysis alludes to why that youth group never worked. What
happens in a small group like this? Well, look at the
pairings. Alpha-to-alpha pairings dominate. Once the alphas start
pairing off and leaving, things start looking a lot worse. 

The above mingler is an _ideal_ case. Let's throw in a few additional
factors, just because this is real life:
* of the 7 alpha women, 4 have steady boyfriends
* of the 5 alpha men, 3 have steady girlfriends, and 1 other has one
but isn't disclosing
* of the rest, 3 of the beta men and 2 of the beta women themselves
are also exclusive.
Let's rerun the numbers again, after adjustin the pool:
3 available alpha women: there will be 
  3 * .666 * .5 * 1 = 1 potential pairings with available alpha guy
  3 * .666 * .5 * 1 = 1 potential pairings with the unavailable alpha guy
  3 * .666 * .2 * 7 = 3 potential pairings with betas
8 available beta women: will be a
  8 * .3 * .5 * 1 = 1 potential pairings with available alpha
  8 * .3 * .5 * 1 = 1 potential pairings with unavailable alpha
  8 * .3 * .2 * 7 = 3 potential pairings with beta men.
So what happened? We only have 10 new pairings, and 2 of them are
bogus. We just went from having 38 to 10 - a factor of 4 drop.

So here's the IRL: the mixers, the youth groups, that sort of thing,
is it doing what one suppose it should? If you're an alpha, it might,
if other people you can relate to will be there. Of course, someone in
your situation will have plenty of opportunities, provided you get out
of the house and don't do dysfunctional things.

If you're a beta, these sorts of things are one of MANY things you
need to do. Look at the above group - it's a pretty sizeable one, over
40 people - yet the number of potential pairings with betas are pretty
minimal. This is in spite of the fact that by definition, a beta is
still someone that _some_ people are going to find attractive. So your
problem is not attitude, it isn't the other sex, it isn't "people
being shallow"; it's numbers. You need to aggressively jack up the
number of people you interact with on a regular basis. And this could
mean major life changes. If you're in a "dating desert," you may need
to move. Just remember that once you move, you still have to meet lots
of people on your own.

And finally, if you were the volunteer running the singles group for
the church (or similar thing); realize the best you can hope for is
the occasional coupling. I've been involved with entities that did
things like this with the explicit goal of getting young people to
form families. Unless you can deal with a truly massive population
base of singles - say, in the thousands - it won't work nearly as well
as you think. This is particularly bad if you have a sect that places
an extremely high degree of importance on chastity before
marriage. What tends to happen in that situation is is the prettiest
couples pair off quite quickly, sometimes forming "starter marriages"
the second they step out of college. What happens when you take the
alphas out of the pool? You are left with people who don't easily
match. 

The goal of these mixers is generally well thought out. People of
normal, modest attractiveness are generally "screened out" within seconds of
an interaction beginning. Attractiveness to such people only comes
with a bit of exposure. The idea that "1 in 3" or "1 in 5" of all
people would be attracted to such a person - that has to happen
through this sort of exposure. The idea of these mixers is to allow
this to happen. But once this happens, and everyone has had the
opportunity to pair up, nothing more is going to happen. And as can be
seen above, odds are that the number of actual cases of mutual
attraction are much lower than you'd think. It will work for
attractive people who are so shy or withdrawn that they wouldn't get
out otherwise. But only a handful of the normals will get lucky this way.

If you want people to get married, giving them an opportunity to
mingle past the stage of chance meetings is fine, but you should be
encouraging them to do other things besides mingle with the same
group! You are going to have to ditch the idea of being able to give a
warm protective space for the community. Instead, focus on pushing
them out in the greater community - where they have a chance of
building the life that will make them happy.
