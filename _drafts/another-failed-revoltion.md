title: So Much For Another Failed Revolution

## Why The Sexual Revolution Failed

Sorry for the long pause. I have been working on a project I've wanted to do for a long time - a
"semantic search" engine for the Baha'i Writings. The idea behind such searches is you type in information
on the subject you want and it looks up the closest thing. No more trying to find the exact word to
search for. Once I put this into a public alpha, I'll write up a post describing what I did, how
I did it, and my roadmap for extension.

Meanwhile, on with the show.

--------------------------------------------------

My thesis this time is prompted by some recent reading I've done. Not Baha'i reading, but reading from
semi-qualified randos on the internet. It is regarding the Baha'i laws around
chastity and my thesis is this:
_"the sexual revolution," as the term is commonly understood, has generally been a negative thing, and more
conservative sexual mores would better serve society and family formation. It would even make single people
who wish to remain "in the market" happier_. 
I believe
social mores associated with "sex positivity" has made relationship-formation difficult for most
singles. As a result, the more this revolution advances, the _fewer_ opportunities people have for the sort
of mature relationships the "sex positive" folk claim to be defending. It seems the more sexual mores 
loosen, the less people seem to take advantage of it! 

The idea that fewer people are having sex than ever isn't an empty one. Many
psychologists and pop culture columnists have noted that young people nowadays have less sex than
prior generations since the baby boom, in spite of having more 
ways than ever to meet people. Some of the down-trend is because high
schoolers are having less sex, something that is generally seen as positive even by some defenders of
looser sexual mores. But it has been trending down across all age groups, even prior to the pandemic.
Various theories are floated about, but very few have fingered a very non-intuitive cause: the sexual
revolution itself.

Like most revolutions, this revolution has left people with a different, just-as-miserable status quo.

I feel more confident in stating this view thanks to some work by other researchers.
Louise Perry's _The Case Against the Sexual Revolution_ is a recent entry of several coming in
from a semi-feminist, quasi-left perspective which examines how this has negatively impacted everyone,
but single women in particular. I've also noted some bemusement from many older
men, noting with alarm that many younger men seem to be unhappily opting out of the dating
market, and wondering why their younger peers are not enjoying the bacchanal lifestyle
they used to live. More thoughtful people have noted that the current dating environment 
seems particularly prone to creating
lots of lonely people. The key element all critics have noted is that the benefits of the sexual revolution
have accrued almost entirely to high status men; men of average means or less and women as a whole
have all on-balance suffered with fewer meaningful relationships and overall lower levels of intimacy
over time. 

Occasionally I find myself agreeing with people I generally don't often agree with, and when I became a
Baha'i, the teachings around chastity did not sit well with me.
Like most people, I had no issue with premarital sex, and I suspect those that do tend to be more
in agreement if they are in a relationshipw with someone they are smitten with. I generally
find myself generally not agreeing with the typical sort of person railing against premaritial sex;
such people
may also look fondly back on the days when women we pressured to marry and stay at home, and chastity
was seen as a woman's duty. While I'm too young to remember such days, enough exposure to literature
and Hollywood classics is enough to remind you that even in those days, a broad sexual double-standard
existed, as the dalliances of promiscuous
men were widely celebrated (provided those men were white). Furthermore, I think feminism has been an
unmitigated good, and I think the emphasis on some circles on "Biblical Families" is a wrongfooted
attempt to force women into certain social roles without their consent. In spite of Baha'i
law, I'm not sure couples "living in sin" really poses a big problem pragmatically.

All that being said, I think there has been enough bad behavior excused in the name of "sexual
liberation" to regard the sexual revolution as on balance negative. Likewise, I think there is a good
chance that in the near future, Baha'i law around chastity will cease being a cause for disbelief 
and modest embarrasment, and instead will
elicit a grudging admiration, in much the same way that as our laws prohibiting the 
consumption of alcohol, once seen as puratin teetotalling, have come to be regarded as generally
respected.

## Pinning Down The Problem

The goal of the sexual revolution was supposed to be freedom from restraint, and even an
improvement in relationships. Men and women,
loving freely. Eliminate the involement of patriarchy, of meddlesome families, of the restrictions
of religion, and we should get more freedom, more happiness and more healthy relationships.
So what happened?

Perhaps the largest problem was what happened during the sexual revolution, and how those
terms were defined. Louise Perry's book certainly makes the case that the sexual revolution
was defined especially on men's terms, not women's. The invention of the pill is posed by many as
benefitting women, but it certainly also benefitted sexually-agressive men, 
who no longer had to swat the objections
of potential pregnancy by women. Indeed, it allowed many men to place the responsibility and blame
for any unintended pregnancies on the women. While some women may have no doubt enjoyed their
sexual liberation as much as the men, for many, it meant their years of courtship were now filled
with men pressuring them for sex before they felt an desire for it. Perry's overarching point is well
taken: the terms on which the sexual revolution were defined were terms that overwhelmingly benefitted
high status men with access to a lot of potential partners.

Another point, perhaps even more concerning, is the fact that
on the aggregate, the social environment that resulted from the sexual revolution has left most people
unhappy. The key problem is a number of truths have been lost in the sexual revolution, and societies
are now discovering these things the hard way. The problem is one of math and family formation,
and no amount of freedom is going to fix that.

### Mating opportunities are unlimited only within same-gendered communities

The conceit behind the more materialistic elements pushing the sexual revolution - such as the glossy magazine purveyors
in Playboy and Cosmopolitan - was that it allowed anyone to live a bacchanal life of indulgence and
sexual satisfaction, provided the lived the right lifestyle (and, of course, consumed the products
in their magazines). You still see echoes of this world view in the sex advice columns that used to appear in
the free weeklies that announced club openings and live music (and phone sex) and now appear next
to similar web ads and ads for dating services. The underlying conceit behind all of this is that
thanks to the sexual revolution, sexual fulfillment is available for everyone.

This view was abetted throughout much of the psychology world, which mostly bought into the underlying
premise, and insisted as viewing sex as another *need* like any other. As there were roughly the same
number of men and women - and since they have plenty of patience both male and female complaining about
loneliness and an inability to get in relationships - then solving this riddle is just a case of everyone
getting enough therapy to eliminate their baggage and partake in the grand banquet of free love.

This is mathematically impossible, and the fact that so few people see through this betrays the individualistic
nature of American society.

To illustrate why this is, we can view the usage of
Tinder, a widely used dating app often derided as a "hook-up" app, as a proxy. What do we see?

First off, on Tinder, there is a severe sexual imbalance in the marketplace. 
Men outnumber women almost three to one. In practice,
the ratio is even worse, since many women's profiles are idle, and many other women are not technically
idle but are still out of the dating pool, using it not for finding matches but as a self-esteem boost
(one woman in an interview even referred to Tinder as the "make me feel pretty app"). The severe imbalance
results in outcomes that would be obvious to any game theorist or system analist.
The bulk of men spend hours searching for matches to no avail, and eventually have to resort to a "shotgun"
approach to reach the tiny handful of women who are actually active. Meanwhile, women complain 
of being inundated by hundreds of suitors, none of which seem willing to spend time on any interaction. The results are
predictable; the only ones that seem happy are the handful of men that are attractive enough to have even
disinterested women reach out to them.

The same dynamics that make Tinder unhappy are not special to Tinder; they're a problem with the whole
nature of dating under the sexual revolution, and it's why different datings sites operating under
different mechanics still fail. There will always be much more demand for sex from men than from
women - either in or outside of a relationship.

Think about your social circle when you were single - you probably
knew plenty of unhappy men who never seemed to have a date, and plenty of women who complained that all the
men they were interested in were uninhibited playboys uninterested in serious relationships. 
Or think back to the days of singles bars, or heck, go to one right now: they are mostly sausage-fests,
with lots of bothersome guys pestering the handful of women that walk in. The exceptions are the
velvet-rope type operations, where (suprise!) the only men that are actually let in are high-status
men.

Nor is it possible to make everyone happy under these rules. The problem
is one of math. There are simply too many "spare men" available to chase women
of childbearing age, and too few available attractive people of any sort. 
When it comes to casual sex, women do have it somewhat easier; after all, certain sorts of attrative men 
are rather easy to find and easy to lay. Not coincidentally, they frequently lie about their
relationship status and are generally the primary source of complaints women have about relationship-averse 
men. Meanwhile the "spare men" continue to pester and hassle young women tired of
full inboxes and random advances from strangers.
Put simply, if the only currency is sex itself, then the marketplace is lopsidedly against men 
and ennervates women, and
there is no way of fixing this. 

If one rejects the "free love" tenants, but still fancies that most people should be able to find love
in consenual, long-term relationships, the present situation is no better. The nonstop competition
for sex, along with the deceit used my many participants, is a gross interference.  The advice given
to unhappy singles by defenders of the sexual revolution does not reflect this fact, and the resulting
advice from these psychologists and advice columnists is
laughable and unworkable. Men are widely told that their problem is they need to "increase their confidence"
and approach a lot more women, even be pushy - in spite of the fact so many women are tired of being approached
in that fashion and frequently find it necessary to be as rude as possible to ward off the most persistent
of suitors. Women are told to "loosen up" and lower their standards, which usually results in accepting the advances of
attractive men who are not suitable relationship material rather than the other way around, 
a cycle that quickly loses its charm.
Both men and women are generally told to "stop being picky," i.e. have physical relationships 
with people you have no desire for, a piece
of advice that the givers of said advice have almost certainly never practiced.

The result? Tons of men who can't seem to get a date. Lots of women who wind up in "one and done" dating
situations with attractive but empty men who toss them overboard after one encounter. And the only winners are a
tiny handful of people who never really had trouble getting attention anyway.

One may say this is just the way things are - indeed, this is like the natural world - and the sexual revolution
had no part to play in this. But a bit of reflection will tell us that this was not ever thus. At one time,
attractive men were encouraged to get married, and most actually went "off the market." This is perhaps an unhappy thing
for young women desireous of exciting sexual encounters, but it did mean a less lopsided playing field, one
that benefitted men and women. One may not pine for the old days when you got married just to have sex, but
still long for the days when a long term committment was understood as important for a sexually functional
relationship.

### Childbearing women are always going to be outnumbered by potential suitors, sometimes overwhelmingly so.

A related issue is one a lot of the "dating coaches" and "pick up artists" would have you rather ignore,
and a fact that baffled the original proponents of the sexual revolution.

Dating began in earnest before the sexual revolution. I'm not educated in
the history of it, but it isn't a stretch to say it was yet another form of courtship, the goal of which
was to pair off and marry. For the most part, it was a young-person's game, and still is, as most people of
child-bearing age still want to marry. Long courtships - interminable years without a proposal - were 
generally a sign of family opposition or foot-dragging by one of the parties.

Unfortunately, dating nowadays does not necessarily have that goal in mind, meaning that people
dating now work at cross-purposes. There are two results of this, one that make both women and men
who date now more unhappy than those in the past.

The first is a side-effect of cruel biology: women have only a certain number of years in which to
have children. There is a biological clock. No matter how much people may pooh-pooh this, a woman's fertility
drops significantly during her thirties. Women who wish to have children must therefore nail down marriage
within a certain time frame. Unfortunately, a lot of attractive men _lie_. Psychologists even have a name
for such men - "stringers". Many women who want children and the associated legal protection of marriage 
waste years of their lives in relationships with men who pose as potential marriage partners, yet never
follow through. Such men, driven by either subconscious fears or outright deceit, string along women during
their prime childbearing years. Their unfortunate victims eventually give up, usually in their mid thirties
when it becomes difficult to both find suitors and have children. Psychologists who have studied such men
guess that each such man is probably responsible for depriving two women of their chance to have children,
and are responsible for a not insignificant fraction of the depressed birth rate in the US.

The growth of dating-as-an-amusement hasn't helped the situation. Women of childbearing ages are also the
most sexually attrative to straight men, leading to the unhappy fact that men interested in a serious
relationship, men interested in a casual fling, and men interested in a 
long-term-relationship-as-long-as-you-stay-hot are all looking for young women of child-bearing ages,
but for entirely different reasons. Women in their early
twenties cannot be expected to sort this out, and all other things being equal, since you can't tell
the difference, you might as well pick the hottest suitor. The other "nice guys" in their twenties get
ignored, but you can hardly blame women for making the same choices men would make in a similar
situation.

The result is that men who want to get married and have kids wind up in an extremely competitive dating
environment, since their prospects are limited to the most desired mates. Those who fail to meet the typical
sorting criteria for dating sites - minimum height, minimum income and natural hair - typically find
themselves locked out of the dating market in their younger years. The logical advice one would
have for such men would be to apply a healthy dose of patience and self-work in preparation for their
later years, since by the late twenties any women
who wants kids should be tired of the playboys and will be desperate an actual grown up with maturity.
If only that were the advice men given! Instead, in my depressed single years, I got the same flawed advice that
many single ment continue to receive from psychologists,
glossy magazines, and self-help books: that the key problem is entirely one of confidence and attitude;
that the only thing holding me back was my reluctance to push my acquantaince on women, no matter how
reluctant they seemed to be, and that any difficulties I had was due entirely to approach and
attitude. Or, that I was "too picky" and should date women I had no attraction to
whatsever just to "get more experience," all with the unstated knowledge that I would eventually have
to dump them - or be dumped due to my obvious disinterest.

The purveyors of the sexual revolution did intend to drive down birth rates beneath the rate that
_women themselves prefer_. Yet this may have had the exact effect. A New York Times survey found that
most women reaching the end of their childbearing years had _fewer_ children than they wanted. While
money was blamed for some of this, there were two other critical factors:
* Inability to find a ready spouse in their childbearing years
* Getting married to late to have the number of children they wanted
While you cannot blame women in their early twenties for failing to look ahead 

### Sexual attraction is a poor way to select a long term mate


### Family formation takes cultural involvement


### Sex is the most important thing only when you're young and have none
