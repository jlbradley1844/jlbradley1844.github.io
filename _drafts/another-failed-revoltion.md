title: So Much For Another Failed Revolution

## Why The Sexual Revolution Failed

Sorry for the long pause. I have been working on a project I've wanted to do for a long time - a
"semantic search" engine for the Baha'i Writings. The idea behind such searches is you type in information
on the subject you want and it looks up the closest thing. No more trying to find the exact word to
search for. Once I put this into a public alpha, I'll write up a post describing what I did, how
I did it, and my roadmap for extension.

Meanwhile, on with the show.

--------------------------------------------------

My post this time is prompted by some recent reading I've done. Not Baha'i reading, but reading from
semi-qualified randos on the internet and in the glossy "serious reader" publications. It is 
regarding the Baha'i laws around chastity and my thesis is this:
_"The sexual revolution," as the term is commonly understood, has generally been a negative thing, and more
conservative sexual mores would better serve society and family formation. It would even make single people
who wish to remain "in the market" happier_. 
I believe
social mores associated with "sex positivity" has made relationship-formation difficult for most
singles. As a result, the more this revolution advances, the _fewer_ opportunities people have for the sort
of mature relationships the "sex positive" folk claim to be defending. It seems the more sexual mores 
loosen, the less people seem to take advantage of it! My reasons are not those of the "conservative"
crowd either, but based on what I (and others) saw and are seeing socially. 

The idea that fewer people are having sex than ever isn't an empty one. Many
psychologists and pop culture columnists have noted that young people nowadays have less sex than
prior generations since the baby boom, in spite of having more 
ways than ever to meet people and less strictures. Actual surveys bear this out as a fact.
Some of the down-trend is because high
schoolers are having less sex, something generally seen as positive, even by defenders of
looser sexual mores. But it has been trending down across all age groups, even prior to the pandemic.

Various theories are floated about, but very few have fingered a very non-intuitive cause: the sexual
revolution itself.
Like most revolutions, this revolution has left people with a different, just-as-miserable status quo.

I feel more confident in stating this view thanks to some work by other researchers.
Louise Perry's _The Case Against the Sexual Revolution_ in particular is a recent example coming
from a semi-feminist, center-left perspective which examines how the sexual revolution
has had negative effects on many,
single women in particular. I've also noted with some bemusement certain older
men commenters seem quite alarmed about the fact that they know of many unhappy younger men
who are opting out of the dating
market. These older men wonder why their younger peers are not enjoying the bacchanal lifestyle
they used to live. Rather than think deeply why that is, they tend to reflexively blame internet porn
and social skills. 

However, more thoughtful people have noted that the current dating environment 
seems particularly prone to creating
lots of lonely people. The key element all critics, male and femal, have noted is that the 
benefits of the sexual revolution
have accrued almost entirely to one particular subset of people: high status men. Men of average 
attractiveness or less and women as a whole
have all on-balance suffered, with fewer opportunities to form meaningful relationships and
overall lower levels of intimacy over time. 

Occasionally I find myself agreeing with people I generally don't often agree with, and when I became a
Baha'i, the teachings around chastity did not initial sit well with me.
Like most people, I had no issue with premarital sex - the idea seemed great, even if its availability
(to me) seemed nonexistent. I generally
found myself disagreeing with the typical sort of person railing against premaritial sex; such people
also look fondly back on the days when women we pressured to marry and stay at home, and chastity
was seen strictly as a woman's duty. While I'm too young to remember such days, enough exposure to literature
and Hollywood classics is enough proof that even in "the good old days," a broad sexual double-standard
reigned, as virginal goodness was held important for young women while the dalliances of promiscuous
high-status men were widely celebrated. Provided those men were white, of course. 
Furthermore, I think feminism has been an
unmitigated good, and I think the emphasis on some circles on "Biblical Families" is a wrongfooted
attempt to force women into certain social roles without their consent. In spite of my own
acceptance of Baha'i
law, I'm not personally sure "living in sin" is as terrible as many other character flaws frequently
excused in society.

All that being said, I think there has been enough bad behavior excused in the name of "sexual
liberation" to regard the sexual revolution as negative. Likewise, I suspect that
even in the near future, Baha'i law around chastity will cease being a cause for disbelief 
and modest embarrasment, and instead will
elicit a grudging admiration, in much the same way that as our laws prohibiting the 
consumption of alcohol, once seen as puratin teetotalling, have come to be regarded as generally
respected.

## Pinning The Problem Down

All revolutions fail
in the same way - by overturning a defective order and replacing it with something no better, or even inferior.
The sexual revolution has been no different. Its virtues seem evident, in that its goal
was supposed to be freedom from unnecessary restraints and improvements
in relationships. Men and women,
loving freely. Eliminate the involement of meddlesome families, of patriarchy, of the arbitrary restictions
of religion, and we should get more freedom, more happiness and more healthy relationships.
So what happened?

Perhaps the root of the problem with the sexual revolution was how the terms of the coming order
were defined. Louise Perry's book certainly makes the case that the sexual revolution
was defined particularly on men's terms, not women's. The invention of the pill and widespread availability
of abortion is posed by many as
benefitting women, but it may have brought even more benefit to sexually-agressive men, 
who no longer had to swat the objections
of potential pregnancy by women. Indeed, it allowed many men to place the responsibility and blame
for any unintended pregnancies on the women. While some women may have no doubt enjoyed their
sexual liberation as much as the men, for many it meant their years of dating were now filled
with men pressuring them for sex before they felt an desire for it. Perry's overarching point is well
taken: the terms of the revolution overwhelmingly benefitted
high status men with access to lots of potential partners.
For everyone else on the aggregate, the social environment that resulted from the sexual 
revolution has left most people in an unhappier situation. 

The key problem is a number of truths have been lost in the sexual revolution, and societies
are now discovering these things the hard way. The problem is one of mathematics and family formation,
and no amount of freedom is going to fix that. Let's lay some of these out in detail.

### Mating opportunities are unlimited only if you ignore math

Free love is only free to a handful, and
the unlimited sexual banquet does not exist. I'll have to exclude same-sex relationships
from this discussion, for reasons that will be evident later.

The conceit behind the more materialistic elements pushing the sexual revolution - for example, 
the glossy magazine purveyors
in Playboy and Cosmopolitan and their well-funded advertizers - was that the sexual revolution allowed 
anyone to live a bacchanal life of indulgence and
sexual satisfaction, provided they lived the right lifestyle, had the right attitude, 
and of course consumed the right products, particularly those advertized in those same magazines.
You still see echoes of this world view in the sex 
advice columns that appear alongside ads for dating services and still appear in the locally-focused
leisure magazines that cover live music, bars, and other entertainments.
That is: sexual fulfillment is available for everyone, provided you get your head on straight, whether
or not a long-term relationship was what you wanted.

This view was abetted throughout much of the psychology world, which generally bought into the underlying
premise; sex was viwed as just another *need*, like eating and sleep. So it was thought the legitimization
of sex should have improved
the lives of all. It probably didn't seem impractical, either; as there are roughly the same
number of men and women, and since therapists have plenty of patients both male and female complaining about
loneliness and an inability to get in relationships, it seemed obvious that solving this issue was as easy
as everyone getting enough therapy to eliminate their baggage and pair the hell up already.

Unfortunately, "enough for everyone" turns out to be mathematically impossible, and the 
fact that so few people saw this betrays the individualistic
nature of American society. As advice given to single individuals it seems reasonable; in the heterosexual 
dating world as a system for everyone as a whole, it does not work. 

To illustrate why this is, I'll use
Tinder, a widely used dating as a proxy for the world
of casual relationships. This seems reasonable, since Tinder users,
whether using this for dating, casual sex, or finding committed relationships, are generally adjusted to the
fact that many of Tinder users are there just for the sex, and it is widely derided as a "hook-up" app. 
What do we see from studying its user base?

On Tinder, there is a severe imbalance in the marketplace. 
Men outnumber women almost three to one. In practice,
the ratio is _even worse_, since many women's profiles are idle, and many other women are not technically
idle but are still inaccessible, as they use Tinder not for finding matches, but as an
amusement or a self-esteem boost
(one woman in an interview even referred to Tinder as her "'Make me feel pretty' app"). The severe imbalance
results in outcomes that would be obvious to any game theorist or system analyst.
The bulk of men spend hours searching for matches to no avail, and eventually resort to a "shotgun"
approach, reaching out to multiple hundreds of women to find the tiny handful that will acknowledge their
existence. Meanwhile, women complain 
of being inundated by hundreds of suitors, none of which seem willing to any time on any interaction. The results are
predictable; the only people made happy are the handful of men whose quantitative specs (mainly hight and
income) are so attractive that they can punch through the wall of noise and reach the otherwise disinterested
women.

The same dynamics that make Tinder unhappy are not special to Tinder; they're a problem with the whole
nature of dating under the sexual revolution, and it's why different datings sites operating under
different mechanics still fail due to the same dynamic. It also explains why 
so many less successful dating sites eventually
succomb to creating "phantom accounts" of attractive women that do not actually exist as users.
There will always be far more demand for sex from men than from
women - either inside or outside of a relationship.
Think about your social circle when you were single - you probably
knew plenty of unhappy men who never seemed to have a date, and plenty of women who complained that all the
men they were interested in were uninhibited playboys uninterested in serious relationships. 
Think back to your singles bar experience, or even go to one right now: they are mostly sausage-fests,
with lots of bothersome guys pestering the handful of women that walk in. The exceptions are the
private parties and velvet-rope operations, where (suprise!) the only men admitted are high-status
men.

Nor is it possible to make everyone happy under these rules. The problem
is one of math. There are simply too many "spare men" available to pursue women,
and too few unattached attractive people, male or female.
When it comes to casual sex, women have it easier, should they want it (provided they get over 
their legitimate fears of sexual assault by men they barely know!). After all, many attrative men 
make themselves easy to find and easy to lay. But the fact women have it easier does not mean they have 
it better, particularly if they would prefer to gravitate toward long-term relationships with men capable
of functioning outside of the bedroom. Not coincidentally, the men they favor frequently lie about their
relationship status and are generally the primary source of complaints women have about relationship-averse 
men. Meanwhile the "spare men" continue to pester and hassle young women tired of
full inboxes and random advances from strangers.
Put simply, if the only currency is sex itself, then the marketplace is lopsidedly against men 
and does not serve women, and there is no way of fixing this. 

The result? Tons of men who can't seem to get a date. Lots of women who wind up in "one and done" dating
situations with attractive but empty men who disappear after one encounter. The "winners" are
the attractive people - the people who never really had trouble "getting any" anyway.

This has been noticed by many, and the solution often voiced by many
is that that those unable to attract a partner just need to lower their standards. Even if
this were an acceptable solution, it implies
the number of men who are DTF are going to be the same as the number of women in a similar
situation, which is not borne out by facts.
The main problem is math, and little can be done about that. 

It goes without saying that this peculiar problem does not exist in same-sex communities - because
the problem of ratios does not exist! - hence my original point. They have their other problems of
course, which I profess no knowledge of. But I'm just mentioning this as a clarification, since this
is a condition peculiar to heterosexual relationships.

There is in fact a solution to these problems, something done frequently in the past, to solve
the problem of unhappiness and instability in pairing up - the so-called "long term 
relationship." In fact, psychologists
have shown that people in long-term relationships have far more sex than people that are on the open market.
But here again, the sexual revolution has caused other problems with those who wish to do form
these, which brings us to the next few points.

### Dating Hell: Why Outnumbered Childbearing Women Still Can't Get What They Want

We've talked about the problem that plain math imposes on a lifetime of sexual hookups.
A related issue is one a lot of the "dating coaches" and "pick up artists" would have you rather ignore,
and a fact that baffled the original proponents of the sexual revolution.
It's the fact that most people seek sexual relations within the framework of a long-term relationship,
even within *gasp* marriage. On top of this, most men and
women want to one day have children, in spite of the damper it would put on any supposed bacchanal lifestyle.
Fulfilling this need means changing some cherished popular beliefs of how dating should work.

Let's start with how dating is done.
Dating began in earnest before the sexual revolution - while it was at first seen as an amusement for the
young, it was also known as a less stuffy form of courtship, and a
necessary part of vetting a partner for marriage.
Nowadays, dating does not necessarily have that goal in mind, but for many this is a motivation, even
if subconscious. So frequently two dating people
now work at cross-purposes. There are two results of this, one that make both women and men in the dating
market more unhappy than those in the past.

The first is a side-effect of cruel biology: women have only a certain number of years in which to
have children. There is a biological clock. No matter how much people may pooh-pooh this, a woman's fertility
drops significantly during her thirties. Women who wish to have children must therefore nail down marriage
commitment within a certain time frame, limiting the time women wish to spend
"just dating." Unfortunately, a lot of attractive men, the sort such women long to
marry, sometime _lie_ about their desire to exit dating. Sometimes over a very long time. Psychologists even have a name
for such men - "stringers". Men who string women along, betraying their significant other by 
promising an eventual committment that never
comes through. Many women who want children and the associated legal protection of marriage 
waste years of their lives in relationships with men who pose as potential marriage partners, only to
find themselves single in their mid thirties,
when it becomes difficult to both find suitors and have children. 

This is a common story, told so often in advice columns that some may be skeptical that 
it actually happens outside of memorable anecdotes. Unfortunately,
that is not the case; is an actual problem. The psychologists who have studied this issue
have found that such men are not rare, and
guess that every such man in the dating pool is on average responsible for depriving two 
women of their chance to have children. How common are such men? They are singlehandedly responsible for
a measurable fraction of the depressed birth rate in the US - perhaps as much as
0.2-0.3 points of the birth rate. Not only do women who fall into this trap lose their childbearing 
years, but it also means a suitable
male somewhere else loses the opportunity to pair up with such a woman - depriving him of the
chance to be a father.

The second problem created by dating at cross-purposes is that even when a woman does begin to "get serious"
about finding a suitable long-term partner, the sexually promiscuous millieu begins to work against her.
The growth of dating-as-long-term-amusement, particularly among the most marriable men,
is the primary problem. Women of childbearing age are not exclusively
appealing to those who wish to have children; they are also extremely
sexually attrative to promiscuous straight men, leading to the unhappy fact that men interested in a serious
relationship, men interested in a casual fling, and men interested in a 
long-term-relationship-with-you-as-long-as-you-stay-hot are all looking almost exclusiviely for young women,
but for entirely different reasons. Women in their early
twenties cannot be expected to sort this out, and probably aren't inclined to anyway:
all other things being equal, you might as well pick the hottest suitor. The less 
attractive "nice guys" in their twenties may feel unjustly
ignored, but you can hardly blame women for making the same choices men make in similar situations.
The assumption women might make is that as they get older and ready to settle down, their male counterpars 
will will get older and ready to settle down. Unfortunately, many of their male counterparts will 
continue to have fun as long as they find young women to date them.

The purveyors of the sexual revolution never intended to drive down birth rates beneath the rate that
_women themselves prefer_, but unfortunately, the social factors pressing young singles to extend dating as
long as possible may have had that exact effect. Many of our less talented commenters have blamed
ambitious women for our lower birth rate, but facts do not bear this out.
A New York Times survey that aimed to answer the riddle of falling birth rates found that
most women reached the end of their childbearing years having had _fewer_ children than they wanted. While
money was blamed for some of this, there were two other factors that were just as critical:
* Inability to find a ready spouse in their childbearing years
* Getting married too late to have the number of children they wanted
Given that dating is now no longer focused on marriage and family formation as an end result, it 
is no surprise that marriage and family formation has gotten more difficult.

Women have an impossible situation, given that so many men have been conditioned to regard
long-term committment as optional once a relationship is engaged. Most men have a different sort of problem.
The less-attractive or less successful
men in their twenties instead must guard against the unrealistic
expectations of romantic success, of both themselves an others. Given that men of all ages wish to date 
the only women they are reasonably suited to date, it is likely many men will fail at dating.
Men who want actually want to form families with children are in an extremely competitive dating
environment, since their prospects are limited to the most desired mates: women young enough to bear children. 
Men who fail to meet the popular
"sorting criteria" - minimum height, minimum income and natural hair, things all readily searchable on
dating sites - can easily find
themselves locked out of the dating market until their mid-thirties, when they finally get a second
look from older women discarded by their playboy boyfriends. Should such a man be fortunate enough to finally 
engage in marriage, they are looking at a small or no family.
Adding insult to injury, this fact is completely unrecognized in the popular press, and seems to 
bewilder many attractive people,
who presume that the fact single women still exist unpaired is proof enough that the unhappy
dateless men merely have an attitude problem and just need to get their act together.

The advice given
to unhappy singles by defenders of the sexual revolution, the psychologists, advice columnists and dating
consultants (yuck), does not factor in these dynamics, which mirrors the problems of the gender mismatch for
those seeking casual sex. The resulting recommendations are tone-deaf and unworkable.
Men are widely told that their problem is they need to "increase their confidence"
and approach a lot more women, even be pushy - in spite of the fact so many women are tired of being approached
in that fashion and frequently find it necessary to be as rude as possible to ward off the most persistent
suitors. Women frustrated with their single life are told to "take a break from dating" - which is something they can
easily do so long as they are culling through bland "nice guys" from the internet, but may have difficulty with if
someone particularly attractive and persistent comes along. Leading to repeating the romantic relationship with
an attractive man who is not suitable relationship material.
Both men and women are generally told to "stop being picky," i.e. have physical relationships 
with people you have no desire for, a piece
of advice that the givers of said advice have almost certainly never practiced, and certainly not one
conducive for formation of long-term relationships.

This makes contracting a marriage in time for children difficult for those who are unlucky or unattractive.
The game as it is played is stacked against most everyone. Unfortunately, the only way to win at a game stacked
against you is to play different game with different people. 

### Sexual attraction is a poor way to select a long term mate

This is going to strike some of you as a lecture, but I'll lecture away. Many
people who find themselves in and out of relationships may need a reminder.
That is: something besides sexual chemistry is
needed for a relationship to work.

People are prone to think in stories and narration, and a common script of the
college-exiting crowd goes like this:
"In my twenties, I'm going to have fun and date lots of attrative/glamourous/unthinkably-hot
people and experience whatever life has to offer me. Once I've had enough, I
will then _get serious_ and start seriously dating. I will meet _the one_ and
we'll get married hand have children."

For those who are not attractive enough to "have everything" in the romantic marketplace, this leads
to a terrible tradeoff, which leads to procrastination.
Long term compatibility and character are not terribly correlated
to sexual attractiveness, and "getting practical" may mean dating attractive people than one would
prefer to date, since attractive relationship-minded people tend to stay in relationships. 
If the circumstances in one's dating circle are favorable, the sexual marketplace
makes the choice even more difficult, as fulfilling sexual relations are available provided one is
quick to "fall in love" and consummate things. For the commitment-minded, this frequently leads to
accidentally entering into the **the relationship** - something a bit like
marriage but without the cohabitation and legal strictures. At which points, things go great
until you or your partner find a flaw that will
keep you from committing to the other person. This will happen frequently - because
"the relationship" was entered based on physical chemistry rather than compatiblity.

Perhaps you're so attractive that this poses no problem to you: an unending series of monogamous 
relationships based on fantastic sexual chemistry sounds appealing. If you're lucky enough to
be able to cycle through many romatic partners, you may eventually find one compatible enough
that you stay together long term, even marry and have children.
Unfortunately, this is not a world of eternal youth, and even those who find themselves in this stuation
may find none of these relationships work out. 
One may exit your mid-thirties and be no closer to finding a marriage partner
than when they left college. And this is the best case only.

In fact, someone who is less attractive may have an easier time getting married -
provided they are actually able to find someone who will date them more than once!
Such people rarely experience blind infatuation or love at first
sight that is actually reciprocated. That means that if they can date, they are probably
dating people with whom they may have only
modest initial physical attraction, but if they meet someone compatible, they may find
themselves entranced for reasons having to do with personality and
character. In other words, falling in love for the sort of reasons one is supposed to
have when one decides
to "get practical." Those spoiled by repeated romantic fulfillment may have it harder,
since no matter how much experience they may have in relationships,
many cannot stand the idea of "getting practal," particularly if their entire
relationship history was sustained entirely by a sexual-romantic cocktail that gets
difficult to find once you and your dating partners are older.

This topic is a bit fraught because of the fact many women have doubtless heard this
before, and men hear it _hardly at all_ and should here it much more. Books like 
_Fertility on Ice_ document the struggles of many women who want to get 
married but are entagled in serious relationships with incompatible, commitment-averse partners. 
The authors of these books sometimes
focus on the fact that it is the men themselves that are causing this situation - can't those
lousy guys just grow up and commit anyway?? - overlooking the fact that in many of these cases,
the men involved frequently never made a secret of their antipathy to marriage, and the mistake
that was made was the presumption by the woman entering this relationship in a romantic whirlwind
that things would change over time.

The problem is not women who choose badly, or the men who refuse to commit. No, once again,
the problem is the behavioral mores of the sexual revolution, and the permanent adolesence 
that it lulls many young single people into. 
There have been surveys that ask people when they believe they are "ready for
marriage." One would hope that most people would answer when they are mature enough to properly identify
a suitable life partner. That is not the answer most people give - instead, based on the answers
given, it seems to be
"when being single stops being fun." Not surprisingly, this happens to both men and women
after their attractiveness in
the dating marketplace has peaked and suitors in the dating pool start to thin out. 
Many blue-collar men say they are ready to marry at twenty-five; not
surprising, given how many women beyond their mid-twenties require only educated suitors. After high school,
dating is all downhill from there. On the other hand, the most sought-after men - the
tall, very educated professionals - often indicate they are ready for marriage in their mid-thirties or even later.
When they do marry, it may be to a much younger woman.

The fact that both men and women push off marriage until dating is difficult is almost certainly
one reason for the increasing number of the unhappily single.
Meanwhile, being "in a relationship" as a young person
can be a pleasant interlued to hide the fact one is subconsciously
pushing off marriage - by being with someone one knows is unsuited for marriage.
The ideal solution is not fun but must be spelled out: it is
* to look at dating for marriage as something one does _instead of_ dating for sexual chemistry, 
* and start doing it while dating is "still fun." 
This is unfortunately
difficult to do in the current dating environment, as so many participants in the dating
market seem driven by something else.

### Family formation takes cultural involvement

When discussing the problems single people have, it is tempting to focus on those who are actually
doing "single person" stuff - dating, courting, living together and generally having a romantic
life. It is far more interesting to write about the travails of those who
have plenty of prospects than for those at the bottom of the dating pool.
It is assumed by the winners of the sexual revolution that the riches are available to everyone;
all, except perhaps a handful of unattractive people, who merely need to adjust their sights downward
and start making others of the less attractive persuasion hapy. 

This is not the way that numbers break
out, and this may speak to the fact why there was so much family involvement in "the bad old days" 
where families were involved and marriage was presumed.
Who couples up? One would think, "well, everybody, eventually." Again, there are just as many
men and women - if people adjust their sights downward, everyone can find someone. Perhaps so.
But things really were different back then.

One thing that is true is that in the past, attractiveness was not a great disqualifier, partly because
it was expected that everyone was expected to marry. Family formation was considered important, and in
monogamous societies, both men and women were expected to marry. Study of every sort
of culture shows that no matter what form the family unit took - and cultures have shown a wide diversity
of family units - family formation was considered a key element in the culture. My purpose is not to explore
the mating rituals and courtship rites of the past, but merely to note that this was almost always present
and considered important.

Generally, courtship and mating involved levels of family and community support and involvement that
is unimaginable today. There was an easily-explained reason for that:
in the mostly-rural environment in which people grew up, opportunities to find mates were
rare and infrequent. Usually, one's extended family and community was the only mechanism by which you might
meet other people looking to wed. For the few in the cities, the well-to-do had their own circumscribed
rites, well familiar to anyone who has come within a few yards of a Jane Austen book. Leaving
things to chance was not only unusual, it was a surefire way to reduce your chance of sex
(let alone marriage) to close to nil, and leave any parents lucky to make it to old age without means of support by
healthy grandchildren. 

The sexual revolution launched its own set of expectations around both courtship and family formation.
Setting aside one's opinion of the views of sexual morality that were propounded, the general outlook that
it led to was extremely individualistic. The expectation of the relationship was that was as soon as
it ceased to be enjoyable for one of the partners, it was terminated. Critically, it was not necessary
that everyone "buy into" this view. Many people do so for goals other than casual sex - to find a long
term mate or even marry. However, dating is a cooperative endeavor, and the terms are generally going to
typically be set by the least committed and more desireable partners. If the people who are most desireable
as mates would prefer to avoid committment, then others will have to choose between dating desireable
low-commitment individuals or dating less desireable individuals.

Urbanization may have supercharged dating by allowing people to meet many other suitable
mates, but the sexual revolution greased the skids by making pairing off even simpler for a certain
sort of "morally casual" individual, where the only standard was "hot or not." In such an environment,
involvement of social networks and extended families not only because unnecessary, but in many ways
presents a bother. Many young people had no desire of pairing up with the "nice people"
their relatives found, people who were mainly made available through relatives because their
appearance and personality made them difficult to pair up in their own social networks.
What replaced them, then, was far more anonymous and oriented towards physical appearances;
first with singles bars in the sixties, then with internet dating in the
naughties. These impersonal marketplaces existed to let people couple up on their own.
The result is similar to the result in the commercial marketplace; a winner-take-all system
where the bulk of opportunity goes to those best able to compete in the marketplace.

The book _Dataclysm_ by former OkCupid CEO Christian Rudder is a fun book which gives a 
uniquely unfettered look at the mathematics and
economic behind dating websites. The book makes available hard statistics, most of which back
up depressing theories you suspected but would rather not hear confirmed.
For instance: over fifty percent of
all couplings that take place are between people in the top twenty percent of attractiveness. 
In other words, over half of all relationships are just hot people dating each other.
Those in the bottom third hardly play the game. It isn't hard to
find validation of this statistical fact either - go to a fancy restaurant in a big city on
Valentine's day, or go to a resort marketed as a romantic getaway and look at the people. You
will quickly notice: these are all people who look better than you. Perhaps much better.
That's not your eyes deceiving you; that's just the odds.
Such people are able to enter relationships
freely, are able to select partners who would meed their needs in a number of ways, and can
generally get married should they even choose to do so. 

That is not a problem. The problem is what to do for the rest of us, those of us who must find 
relationships in which mutual attraction exists among other available
singles, even though they may not be the hottest of our desires.

This is the same as it ever was. People of modest attractiveness don't just want to marry a
"nice person" who will make a good-enough spouse; they still want partners attractive
enough to "fall in love with," and there are never enough such people in the dating market. The social
pressures to "settle," looks-wise, no longer exist; nor do the necessary signals exist in the dating
marketplace telling other people their only realistic hope is to be more realistic. Indeed, the
we have entire industries dedicated to telling people that is not the case.

This is not an unsolved puzzle, and most psychologist have no problem pinning down the secret
to "love among the average." Familiarity and friendship are the two key elements that make it easier
become attracted to each other, and if one has personality and character, people will often find
themselves as attracted to them as someone more beautiful but lacking other qualities. 
Half of all relationships may be amoung the most attractive people,
but given that most will still wed sometime in their life, it is obviously the case that people who
are not in that elect can still become happily married, and it is doubtful all of them woke up one
day and decide

The problem is that modern life seems to discourage the sorts of casual friendships that might
lead to something. Many people live in cities where they are unlikely to run into the same people
repeatedly, other than a few close friends. Others live in communities that are "dating deserts";
areas where you are unlikely to be in contact with anyone single of the opposite sex. 
This is compounded by some of the bizarre beliefs of the under-forty set that rule out dating
co-workers, regard friends as off-limits for dating, and otherwise discourage dating anyone that isn't
a complete stranger under the guise of "respect for the relationship. The result
is that those of modest attractiveness, who rarely meet the large number of people they would need
to meet to find someone attracted to them, stay single as they are denied the sorts of repeated interations that
would allow someone to _develop_ an attraction to them. The older mechanisms
of meeting did a better job facilitating such matches. Things like dating sites, speed dating,
and more anonymous mechanisms do a much poorer job, and when that is the only thing the culture
has in the offering, it is no wonder that only attractive people pair up.

While this it is easy to state this is a result of "things nowadays" and "social changes,"
there is a reason for this, and the reason is evident to see. A large number of people in the
dating market are out for casual sex, and the demand for that is a lot easier to cater to.
Indeed, stable relationships are far harder to make money off of than the churn of people
looking for the next hot thing.

It isn't possible to make everyone happy in casual sexual relationships. It is possible to
help most people enter into long term relationships which lead towards marriage. This will only
be possible with the help of our social culture and norms, perhaps meaning giving some of the
old ways of meeting people a chance. The new, more anonymous mechanisms developed in the period of the sexual
revolution has failed too many of its participants.

### Sex is the most important thing only when you're young and have none

Time for a possibly new vocabulary term: _hedonic adaptation_.

That is the term by which something that used to make you very happy now longer brings happiness.
It's the reason the first bite of the cheesecake is so much better than the last, the reason
a raise makes you happy the day you get it but not when months later after it allowed you to
pay your bills, the reason one can easily develop a bad habit even when you've stopped enjoying
it. You simply stop being happy over something.

Those who have studied hedonic adaptation have found one thing is particular is vulnerable
to hedonic adaptation: _romantic and sexual fulfillment_.

It's the reason certain suitable people who claim to desire marriage instead wind up in
a series of whirlwind romances that peter out within the year. If you luck into someone who is
totally sexually fulfilling, that feeling will last six to twelve months. After that, you'd better
hope you still actually like the person you're banging.

There is no way to work around this: sexual attraction in your partner is important. The question
is exactly how this fact is handled by anyone in the dating market. When the purpose of dating is
sexual activity, then sexual attraction is really _the only_ thing that matters. Well, other than
personal safety; you don't want to hook up with anyone insane or someone who will rob you. But those
are primarily disqualifiers. There is no reason to look past anything but sex.

If your goals are something other than sex though, then one has determine how important it is
relative to the other reasons you are dating. Yes, some readers may find things like character
and kindness important parts of sexual attractiveness, but there are limits to this. Such things
are typically borne of first impressions, and if you are viewing someone you're already physically
attracted to, your judgement of their actions may be influenced by "the halo effect". The halo
effect is the well known cognitive bias where actions performed by attractive people are judged
more positively than those same actions when performed by someone unattractive; indeed, if someone
is ugly or viewed as "different," that same bias causes people to read negative intent in neutral
actions.

So sexual attractiveness makes it very difficult to judge the suitability of a partner.
Unfortunately the fog of lust can be so thick that one cannot see neutrally until
a relationship has actually been consummated and hedonic adaptation sets in several months later.

The key is to realize that no matter who one dates, no matter how attractive or lovely this
person may seem, several months in your happiness will depend not upon your romantic fulfillment,
but upon much simpler standards of their character, things you will not grow inured to within
the lifespan of a bottle of shampoo.

While the sexual revolution was never about making everyone _happy_, there are certainly those
that promised this implicitly. And there are plenty of eighteen-year-olds (mostly men, but still)
who think that if they had all the sex they ever wanted, or if they had that _one special person_
with whom they had dynamite sexual chemistry, that they would never be unhappy about anything
else again. In this case, however, the cake is a lie. Hedonic adaptation ensures that even should you
find whatever you want in a willing sexual partner,`it will never be enough.

For those who are dating in a lopsided dating market and feel their chances are ruined, there is
hope. But it is not to be done by playing the same game as everyone else. It can only be done by
looking for something that no one else seems terribly interested in. Dating for personaltiy seems
terribly boring - why would you date someone you'd rather have as a friend than a lover? But if this
is the position you find yourself in again and again, some reflection is in order.

Because, over the span of years, if you find someone of the opposite sex that is _sympatico_ on
a special level, and felt that way with this person consistently, then there is a level of connection
that is as likely to sustain you as any initial physical spark. This can certainly be taken too far.
If out of desperation one starts a romance with a friend whom you actually find physically unattractive, one
you cannot imagine intimacy with, the relationship is doomed, and so is your friendship. But 
that is almost certainly not
the case with most of the people of the opposite sex. This is not easy; it is much 
harder to find someone with whom
one can develop a special connection with than it is to find the hottest person in the bar. But
you're far more likely to have such a person to yourself.

Those who are young are substantially penalized in this area; young people are still maturing,
and their sex drives frequently swamp out other considerations. One should not be surprised that
young people frequently mistake sexual infatuation for some sort of deep abiding connection based
on a person's innermost character. But with personal growth, most do not stay at this stage
long. Perhaps when one exits this stage, they can truly say to themselves and to others that
they are "ready for marriage."

## What To Do As an Single Unhappy with All That




 - no matter when you go back into history, sexual attractiveness
was always very desired in mates. Today, it seems natural that you pursue others based on sexual
attractivenes; in the past, when choice was circumscribed by society, 
societies that 



This does not mean things are impossible, however. 
If more attractive people are single for longer, it is illogical that this would pose problems
for anyone else! Indeed, the initial reaction to suggesting it does would be bizarre
bewilderment for most readers here. Unfortunately, it does, and the problem is simply one of human nature.
When evaluating whether to enter into a relationship with anyone, the temptation is to 
judge their partner based on _perceived_ other available singles, rather than on their own. 
It is much harder to commit when one things of themselves as settling, particularly if one
thinks something hotter is right around the corner.

There is nothing novel about very desireable people being picky because they can; what is different
now is there is no longer pressure for such people to commit to marriage until their biological
clock forces them to think differently. In the past, social pressures prevailed upon people to get
married well before one's "biological clock" was even a factor, and no one is calling for the bad
old days of teenage brides. This creates a challenge for those who want committment.

In "the bad old days" there were two countervailing factors. First, the most eligible men and
women were pressured into marriage; indeed, given the religious mores of the time, many eagerly
married early simply so they could have sex. This created a dynamic where the most attrative
partners left the dating pool at a reasonably early age. The other force was that those who were
in danger of marrying late were generally encouraged, in one way or another, to be "more realistic"
at an early age, when they still had the attractiveness of their youth. The result was that for
the most part, "the biological clock" was rarely an issue.
The problem with hurrying up marriage is, of course, the unsuitable marriages that often resulted
from such social pressures. 

However, there is no forced binary choice between early, unhappy marriages and "too-late-for-children"
marriages. It is quite possible to date intentionally when you wish to get married, somehow cull
through the noise and find someone that is suited for you. The key is, unfortunately, to block
the noise created by the sexual revolution. If you wanted to get married, at least the culture was
on your side. It is now not the case.

#### Dating Websites: A Special Problem

There is another pernicious influence that really can't be blamed
on the sexual revolution. It is the way internet dating websites are run.

ong-term relationships. Their purpose is to create what appears to be a working "marketplace"
for dating, and they get money by selling premium memberships. The way they sell those is
by promising people they will get better responses from more attrative people from such premium
memberships. The key is to keep everyone engaged in the marketplace, even if only the most
attractive people see a benefit. And to sign up as many young women as possible, since that
is the one thing most struggling dating websites are lacking.

Were people pairing off and exiting the dating market, it would quickly become an
unprofitable business. The business, therefore, is one of selling hope. For women, that means
making it free to join and giving even the free joiners the ability to 
search and filter on the two most desireable, easily quantifiable attributes of men:
their height and their income. What better improvement on "the real world" if you can get rid of
the losers you don't want to talk to. For men, that means profiles of attractive women - real
or not, active or not - and making it easy to contact as many of them as humanly possible. And for
everyone, lots of free articles about how to make internet dating work for you, just so you
don't bail.

Of course, many stil fail even with the premium membership, particularly the guys and older women,
who make up the bulk of such purchases. This is why why so many less-reputable
websites have been caught using chatbots to emulate user on fictional profiles, particularly for
the usual case where there are far more guys than women. The
dating websites have also found that if someone exits the dating website, they can be tempted
to rejoin if you send them a batch of very attractive profiles - just enough temptation to
shake them out of the new relationship that might have caused them to exit the website.

This is probably the way things will remain in the forseeable future; it's unlikely that
the free market and the internet will ever provide a superior replacement to the 
mating rituals of cultures gone by, flawed as they were.
Unfortunately, there is no nonprofit dating-site equivalent of CraigsList, the website that
singlehandedly put classified ads out of business by doing for free what people had previously
paid a lot of money doing. Dating websites have enormous network effects, and the result
is expected; most websites are now owned by the same publishing quasi-monopoly AIG, for which
the profit motive remains front and center, and given the thin margins the business has had
historically, it will probably remain that way.


If the sexual revolution is at all to blame on this, it is due to the fact that internet dating
is much more suited to pairing up attractive people so they can have sex with each other than it
is for pairing up those with average levels of acctractiveness for more significant relationships. That was
the main reason Tinder took off; it turned out the most attractive people really couldn't be bothered
with creating an elaborate profile, that all most people were interested in were looks, and that many
were more interested in dreaming about endless choices of possible partners than they were the
interested in the reality of making one of them work long term. As a way for alpha men to find alpha
women, it excelled. For the rest of us, not so much.






The logical advice one would
have for such unhappy men would be to apply a healthy dose of patience and self-work in preparation for their
later years, since by the late twenties any women
who wants kids should be tired of the "playas" and will be desperate to date an actual grown up with maturity.
If only that were the advice such men were given! Instead, the advice they are given just makes things worse for
both themselves and women: _be the sort of person women complain about_. I can speak of this from personal experience;
I entered my twenties as a shorter-than-average, introverted, depressed,
inexperienced young male - not the sort of man that women find appealing. And I got the same flawed advice from
therapists that many single men received from psychologists,
glossy magazines and self-help books: that the key romantic problem men 
have is entirely one of lacking confidence and attitude;
that the only thing holding men back from success was a reluctance to push their acquantaince onto women, no matter how
reluctant they seemed to be; that any difficulties a man has is due entirely to approach and
attitude; and finally, that any man who still cannot change is look is just "too picky" and should 
date women they have no attraction to in order to
"get more experience" - with the implied promise they can just dump them later when something hotter
comes along. As for the last point, psychologists
may claim valid reasons to do this; oftentimes, the main problem a guy might have dating is a complete lack
of relationship experience outside of "one-and-done" casual dates that never went anywhere, and the only way to 
treat inexperience is to push a guy hard into experience, even if an ill-fitting one.
But such experience is just as likely to be unhelpful, and makes
things worse for the unhappy women who have unwittingly been elected to housebreak such men.

The result of all of this is that the dating environment is made worse by the sexual revolution. If dating
consisted entirely of what relationship counselors recommend - a way of sizing up other people and potentially entering
into relationships based on their personality and suitability - it would still be very difficult. Unfortunately,
it is made far worse by those who are simply out to gain sexual congress by whatever means necessary. 
I'll restate something said earlier: the main problem is the rules of the game are rigged against you, and the only
way to win is to play a different game. This means rethinking some of the assumptions about proper behavior
when dating.


Both men and have to think hard about marriage and kids earlier than
they wish. For women, it means giving up spending years in the hope of finally "roping in"
a Mr. Big, someone who has never shown signs of being serious
about committment, into long term committment and parenthood. And for men, if they are serious about family,
that means dating women who are actually ready for such a thing and making themselves availabe and attractive to them,
rather than continuing to take a swing at the extremely attractive, extremly young out-of-college crowd, who are far
more likely to be looking for thrills than settling down. Oh, and leave off the
self pity about "women not wanting a nice guy"; in the unlikely case that really and truly is your only problem,
you need to start hanging with a different crowd - and 
maybe start looking for partners with the traits that you claim others should
value in you.


Let's set the stage for the present state of affairs.
Back in the old days, it was presumed that one would find their marriage partner in high school (!)
or college. No matter how someone might long for those days, it has little to recommend it. People who
get married very early in life are responsible for the bulk of the divorices that occur.
Ideally, the collapse
of this world view should lead to happier marriages somewhat later in life, complete with children. People would
be exposed to more partners, grow psychologically, know more about who they are compatible with, and after years
of dating and "finding themselves," would marry someone uniquely suited to them. Certainly nobod expected
a fallof in family formation and a collapse in child birth. Yet that is precisely what happened. 
The cause is unfortunately a side effect of the way most people think about relationships after the sexual revolution.


This lays a trap for both men and women. For the less attractive men, their twenties
are marked both by immaturity and extremly long dry spells in dating, as so many of their
women peers are in committed relationships. By the time such men reach their thirties and
older women are willing to give them a second look, they still have so little relationship
experience that their female peers find them undateable. Meanwhile
many young women in their twenties
feel it is far to early to search for a suitable life partner, but this is unfortunately the time of their
life where they are the most attractive to men and likely to be inundated with attention, wanted and
otherwise, and particularly to men looking for strictly physical relationships without any possibility
of marriage. The time when they are forced to "get serious" is unfortunately the time when they 
may no longer be getting
attention from the sort of men they like, and instead are stuck with the "spare men" I just mentioned. 
While I know this advice will not be eagerly received by 
many, the solution is evident: stop dating-for-fun while it is still fun.

\* There are two risk factors that are responsible for the vast majority of divorices:
1) getting married too early in life;
2) getting married too quickly.
In the northeast where I live, this is far less common than other parts in the country. The
divorce rate is actually far less - perhaps 35%, and even lower for first marriages. This is
in spite of its reputation among some parts of America as being an immoral hellhole.

\*\* Certain self-regarding social critics often hold up the fact that people in small towns
get married more readily than people in big cities as yet another way that Small Town Folk are
morally superior to those Nasty People In The Big City. I strongly suspect it has nothing to do with
any alleged moral superiority, and everything to do with the
fact that the thinning pools date out so quickly in the small towns - dating in a small town
stops being fun fast.
