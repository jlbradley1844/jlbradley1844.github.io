title: So Much For Another Failed Revolution

## Why The Sexual Revolution Failed

Sorry for the long pause. I have been working on a project I've wanted to do for a long time - a
"semantic search" engine for the Baha'i Writings. The idea behind such searches is you type in information
on the subject you want and it looks up the closest thing. No more trying to find the exact word to
search for. Once I put this into a public alpha, I'll write up a post describing what I did, how
I did it, and my roadmap for extension.

Meanwhile, on with the show.

--------------------------------------------------

My thesis this time is prompted by some recent reading I've done. Not Baha'i reading, but reading from
semi-qualified randos on the internet. It is regarding the Baha'i laws around
chastity and my thesis is this:
_"the sexual revolution," as the term is commonly understood, has generally been a negative thing, and more
conservative sexual mores would better serve society and family formation. It would even make single people
who wish to remain "in the market" happier_. 
I believe
social mores associated with "sex positivity" has made relationship-formation difficult for most
singles. As a result, the more this revolution advances, the _fewer_ opportunities people have for the sort
of mature relationships the "sex positive" folk claim to be defending. It seems the more sexual mores 
loosen, the less people seem to take advantage of it! 

The idea that fewer people are having sex than ever isn't an empty one. Many
psychologists and pop culture columnists have noted that young people nowadays have less sex than
prior generations since the baby boom, in spite of having more 
ways than ever to meet people. Some of the down-trend is because high
schoolers are having less sex, something that is generally seen as positive even by some defenders of
looser sexual mores. But it has been trending down across all age groups, even prior to the pandemic.
Various theories are floated about, but very few have fingered a very non-intuitive cause: the sexual
revolution itself.

Like most revolutions, this revolution has left people with a different, just-as-miserable status quo.

I feel more confident in stating this view thanks to some work by other researchers.
Louise Perry's _The Case Against the Sexual Revolution_ is a recent entry of several coming in
from a semi-feminist, quasi-left perspective which examines how this has negatively impacted everyone,
but single women in particular. I've also noted some bemusement from many older
men who seem quite alarmed about the prospects of many younger men; these younger 
men seem to be unhappily opting out of the dating
market, and wondering why their younger peers are not enjoying the bacchanal lifestyle
they used to live. Rather than think of why that is, most of these older men blame internet porn.
More thoughtful people have noted that the current dating environment 
seems particularly prone to creating
lots of lonely people. The key element all critics have noted is that the benefits of the sexual revolution
have accrued almost entirely to high status men; men of average means or less and women as a whole
have all on-balance suffered with fewer meaningful relationships and overall lower levels of intimacy
over time. 

Occasionally I find myself agreeing with people I generally don't often agree with, and when I became a
Baha'i, the teachings around chastity did not initial sit well with me.
Like most people, I had no issue with premarital sex - the idea seemed great, even if its availability
(to me) seemed nonexistent. I generally
find myself disagreeing with the typical sort of person railing against premaritial sex; such people
also look fondly back on the days when women we pressured to marry and stay at home, and chastity
was seen strictly as a woman's duty. While I'm too young to remember such days, enough exposure to literature
and Hollywood classics is enough to remind you that even in "the good old days," a broad sexual double-standard
reigned, as virginal goodness was held important for young women while as the dalliances of promiscuous
men were widely celebrated. Provided those men were white, that is. Furthermore, I think feminism has been an
unmitigated good, and I think the emphasis on some circles on "Biblical Families" is a wrongfooted
attempt to force women into certain social roles without their consent. In spite of Baha'i
law, I'm not personally sure couples "living in sin" really poses a big problem to one's spiritual growth.

All that being said, I think there has been enough bad behavior excused in the name of "sexual
liberation" to regard the sexual revolution as on balance negative. Likewise, I think there is a good
chance that in the near future, Baha'i law around chastity will cease being a cause for disbelief 
and modest embarrasment, and instead will
elicit a grudging admiration, in much the same way that as our laws prohibiting the 
consumption of alcohol, once seen as puratin teetotalling, has come to be regarded as generally
respected.

## Pinning Down The Problem

The goal of the sexual revolution was supposed to be freedom from restraint, and even an
improvement in relationships. Men and women,
loving freely. Eliminate the involement of patriarchy, of meddlesome families, of the restrictions
of religion, and we should get more freedom, more happiness and more healthy relationships.
So what happened?

Perhaps the largest problem was what happened during the sexual revolution, and how those
terms were defined. Louise Perry's book certainly makes the case that the sexual revolution
was defined particularly on men's terms, not women's. The invention of the pill is posed by many as
benefitting women, but it certainly also benefitted sexually-agressive men, 
who no longer had to swat the objections
of potential pregnancy by women. Indeed, it allowed many men to place the responsibility and blame
for any unintended pregnancies on the women. While some women may have no doubt enjoyed their
sexual liberation as much as the men, for many, it meant their years of courtship were now filled
with men pressuring them for sex before they felt an desire for it. Perry's overarching point is well
taken: the terms on which the sexual revolution were defined were terms that overwhelmingly benefitted
high status men with access to a lot of potential partners.

Another point, perhaps even more concerning, is the fact that
on the aggregate, the social environment that resulted from the sexual revolution has left most people
unhappy. The key problem is a number of truths have been lost in the sexual revolution, and societies
are now discovering these things the hard way. The problem is one of math and family formation,
and no amount of freedom is going to fix that.

### Mating opportunities are unlimited only if you ignore math

Here I'll explain why the unlimited sexual banquet does not exist. I'll have to exclude same-sex relationships
from this discussion, for reasons will be evident later.

The conceit behind the more materialistic elements pushing the sexual revolution - the glossy magazine purveyors
in Playboy and Cosmopolitan and their well-funded advertizers, for one - was that it allowed 
anyone to live a bacchanal life of indulgence and
sexual satisfaction, provided the lived the right lifestyle. And, of course, consumed the products
heavily advertized by these materialists. You still see echoes of this world view in the sex 
advice columns that used to appear in
the free weeklies that announced club openings and live music and now appear alongside
ads for dating services. The underlying conceit behind all of this is that
thanks to the sexual revolution, sexual fulfillment is available for everyone.

This view was abetted throughout much of the psychology world, which generally bought into the underlying
premise and insisted as viewing sex as another *need* like any other. This legitimation should have improved
the lives of all, it was felt; as there are roughly the same
number of men and women, and since therapists have plenty of patients both male and female complaining about
loneliness and an inability to get in relationships, then solving this riddle is just required everyone
getting enough therapy to eliminate their baggage and partake in the grand banquet of free love.

This is mathematically impossible, and the fact that so few people see through this betrays the individualistic
nature of American society. As advice given to single individuals it seems reasonable; in the heterosexual 
dating world as a system, it does not work. To illustrate why this is, I'll use
Tinder, a widely used dating as a proxy for the world
of casual relationships. This is ideal, since Tinder users,
whether using this for dating, casual sex, or finding committed relationships, are generally adjusted to the
fact that many of Tinder users are there just for the sex; it is widely derided as a "hook-up" app. 
What do we see from studying the user base?

On Tinder, there is a severe imbalance in the marketplace. 
Men outnumber women almost three to one. In practice,
the ratio is even worse, since many women's profiles are idle, and many other women are not technically
idle but are still out of the dating pool, using it not for finding matches but as a self-esteem boost
(one woman in an interview even referred to Tinder as the "make me feel pretty app"). The severe imbalance
results in outcomes that would be obvious to any game theorist or system analist.
The bulk of men spend hours searching for matches to no avail, and eventually have to resort to a "shotgun"
approach, reaching out to multiple hundreds of women to reach the tiny handful that are actually active. 
Meanwhile, women complain 
of being inundated by hundreds of suitors, none of which seem willing to any time on any interaction. The results are
predictable; the only people made happy are the handful of men that are attractive enough to have even
disinterested women reach out to them.

The same dynamics that make Tinder unhappy are not special to Tinder; they're a problem with the whole
nature of dating under the sexual revolution, and it's why different datings sites operating under
different mechanics still fail due to the same dynamic. There will always be much more demand for sex from men than from
women - either inside or outside of a relationship.
Think about your social circle when you were single - you probably
knew plenty of unhappy men who never seemed to have a date, and plenty of women who complained that all the
men they were interested in were uninhibited playboys uninterested in serious relationships. 
Or think back to the days of singles bars, or heck, go to one right now: they are mostly sausage-fests,
with lots of bothersome guys pestering the handful of women that walk in. The exceptions are the
velvet-rope type operations, where (suprise!) the only men admitted are high-status
men.

Nor is it possible to make everyone happy under these rules. The problem
is one of math. There are simply too many "spare men" available to chase women
of childbearing age, and too few available attractive people of any sort. 
When it comes to casual sex, women have it easier; after all, many attrative men 
make themselves easy to find and easy to lay. Not coincidentally, such men frequently lie about their
relationship status and are generally the primary source of complaints women have about relationship-averse 
men. Meanwhile the "spare men" continue to pester and hassle young women tired of
full inboxes and random advances from strangers.
Put simply, if the only currency is sex itself, then the marketplace is lopsidedly against men 
and ennervates women, and
there is no way of fixing this. 

If one rejects the "free love" tenants, but still fancies that most people should be able to find love
in consenual, long-term relationships, the present situation is no better. The nonstop competition
for sex, along with the deceit used my many participants, is a gross interference.  The advice given
to unhappy singles by defenders of the sexual revolution, the psychologists, advice columnists and dating
consultants (yuck), does not reflect this fact, leading to recommendations that are laughable and unworkable.
Men are widely told that their problem is they need to "increase their confidence"
and approach a lot more women, even be pushy - in spite of the fact so many women are tired of being approached
in that fashion and frequently find it necessary to be as rude as possible to ward off the most persistent
suitors. Women are told to "loosen up" and lower their standards, which usually results in accepting the advances of
attractive men who are not suitable relationship material, a cycle that quickly loses its charm.
Both men and women are generally told to "stop being picky," i.e. have physical relationships 
with people you have no desire for, a piece
of advice that the givers of said advice have almost certainly never practiced.

The result? Tons of men who can't seem to get a date. Lots of women who wind up in "one and done" dating
situations with attractive but empty men who toss them overboard after one encounter. And the only winners are a
tiny handful of very attractive people - the sorts who never really had trouble getting attention anyway.
As for the suggestion that those unable to attraced a partner just need to lower their standards, this
still implies the number of men who are DTF are going to be the same as the number of women in a similar
situation. This is not even close to being the case. 

The main problem being math, there is very little tht can be done. In fact, there is something that has
been done in the past, very frequently - the so-called "long term relationship." In fact, psychologists
have shown that people in long-term relationships have far more sex than people that are on the open market.
But here again, the sexual revolution has caused other problems.

### Childbearing women are outnumbered by potential suitors, but still can't get what they want

A related issue is one a lot of the "dating coaches" and "pick up artists" would have you rather ignore,
and a fact that baffled the original proponents of the sexual revolution.

It's the fact that most people seek sexual relations within the framework of a long-term relationship,
even within *gasp* marriage. And people in such relationships have more sex - frequently far more sex - than
those who have to obtain satisfaction on "the free market" with casual encounters and short-term relationships.
On top of this, most men and
women want to one day have children, in spite of the damper it would put on any supposed bacchanal lifestyle.
Recognizing this means changing some cherished beliefs of the sexual revoltuion. 

Dating began in earnest before the sexual revolution. I'm not educated in
the history of courship, but it's unarguable to think that when dating developed in the postwar era,
it was sen as yet another form of courtship, the goal of which
was to pair off and marry. For the most part, dating was a young-person's game. 
Long courtships - interminable years without a proposal - were 
generally a sign of family opposition or foot-dragging by one of the parties and was seen
as sufficient reason to break off an engagement, just as they were in the days when courtship was
far more stuffy and arranged.

Nowadays, dating does not necessarily have that goal in mind. So frequently two dating people
now work at cross-purposes. There are two results of this, one that make both women and men
who date now more unhappy than those in the past.

The first is a side-effect of cruel biology: women have only a certain number of years in which to
have children. There is a biological clock. No matter how much people may pooh-pooh this, a woman's fertility
drops significantly during her thirties. Women who wish to have children must therefore nail down marriage
within a certain time frame. This means women generally expect they have a limited time to be
"just dating." Unfortunately, a lot of attractive men, the sort such women long to
marry, sometime _lie_ about their desire to exit dating. Sometimes over a very long time. Psychologists even have a name
for such men - "stringers". Many women who want children and the associated legal protection of marriage 
waste years of their lives in relationships with men who pose as potential marriage partners, yet never
follow through. Such men, driven by either subconscious fears or outright deceit, can string along women during
critical childbearing years. Their unfortunate victims eventually give up, usually in their mid thirties
when it becomes difficult to both find suitors and have children. 

This is a common story, one that seems suited to morality tales but has little statistical import in
the real world; vivid stories and anecdotes are not the same as data. Unfortunately, this is not the case. 
Psychologists who have studied this have found that such men are common, and
guess that each such man in the dating pool is on average responsible for depriving two 
women of their chance to have children,
causing a not insignificant fraction of the depressed birth rate in the US - perhaps as
much as 0.2 points. Not only do women who fall into this trap lose their childbearing 
years, but it also means a suitable
male somewhere else loses the opportunity to pair up with such a woman - depriving him of the
chance to father children.

The second problem is that women find that as early as their late twenties find that things suddenly
much worse for dating, right when wish to exit the dating pool to form families.
The purveyors of the sexual revolution never intended to drive down birth rates beeath the rate that
_women themselves prefer_. Unfortunately, the desire to extend dating as long as possible, one of the key freedoms
of the sexual revolution, may have had the exact effect. Many of our less talented commenters have blamed
ambitious women for our lower birth rate, but this is nowhere near the true cause.
A New York Times survey that aimed to answer the riddle of falling birth rates found that
most women reached the end of their childbearing years having had _fewer_ children than they wanted. While
money was blamed for some of this, there were two other just as critical critical factors:
* Inability to find a ready spouse in their childbearing years
* Getting married to late to have the number of children they wanted

The growth of dating-as-long-term-amusement, particularly among the most suitable men with whom childbearing
women enter relationships with, is the primary problem. Women of childbearing ages are not exclusively
appealing to those who wish to have children; they are also extremely
sexually attrative to promiscuous straight men, leading to the unhappy fact that men interested in a serious
relationship, men interested in a casual fling, and men interested in a 
long-term-relationship-as-long-as-you-stay-hot are all looking for young women of child-bearing ages,
but for entirely different reasons. Women in their early
twenties cannot be expected to sort this out, and probably aren't inclined to anyway:
all other things being equal, you might as well pick the hottest suitor. The less 
attractive "nice guys" in their twenties typically feel unjustly
ignored, but you can hardly blame women for making the same choices men would make in a similar situation.
The result is that men who want actually want to form families with children wind up in an extremely competitive dating
environment, since their prospects are limited to the most desired mates. Those who fail to meet the typical
sorting criteria for dating sites - minimum height, minimum income and natural hair - can easily find
themselves locked out of the dating market until their mid-thirties, when they are getting a second
look from older women discarded by their playboy boyfriends.
Women, on the other hand, frequently find themselves victimized by their earstwhile long-term boyfriends,
who whatever their desire to have kids, frequently find themselves trying to "run out the clock" and
guarantee a child-free existence with their current partner - until, that is, someone hotter comes along.

The impossible situation women have is mirrored by the situation of less-attractive or less successful
men in their twenties, who struggle against unrealistic expectations of romantic success. The logical advice one would
have for such men would be to apply a healthy dose of patience and self-work in preparation for their
later years, since by the late twenties any women
who wants kids should be tired of the "playas" and will be desperate to date an actual grown up with maturity.
If only that were the advice such men were given! Instead, the advice they are given just makes things worse for
both themselves and women. I can speak of this from personal experience;
I entered my twenties as a shorter-than-average, introverted, depressed,
inexperienced young male - not the sort of man that women find appealing. And I got the same flawed advice from
therapists that many single men received from psychologists,
glossy magazines and self-help books: that the key romantic problem men 
have is entirely one of lacking confidence and attitude;
that the only thing holding men back from success was a reluctance to push their acquantaince onto women, no matter how
reluctant they seemed to be; that any difficulties a man has is due entirely to approach and
attitude. And finally: that any man who still cannot change is look is just "too picky" and should 
date women they have no attraction to in order to
"get more experience" - with the implied promise they can just dump them later when something hotter
comes along. As for the last point, psychologists
may claim valid reasons to do this; oftentimes, the main problem a guy might have dating is a complete lack
of relationship experience outside of "one-and-done" casual dates that never went anywhere, and the only way to 
treat inexperience is to push a guy hard into experience, even if an ill-fitting one.
But such experience is just as likely to be unhelpful, and makes
things worse for the unhappy women who have unwittingly been elected to housebreak such men.

The result of all of this is that the dating environment is made worse by the sexual revolution. If dating
consisted entirely of what relationship counselors recommend - a way of sizing up other people and potentially entering
into relationships based on their personality and suitability - it would still be very difficult. Unfortunately,
it is made far worse by those who are simply out to gain sexual congress by whatever means necessary. This makes
it a losing game for all but the most attractive and phlegmatic. Unfortunately, the only way to win at a game stacked
against you is to play different game with different people. Women - and men - have to think hard about marriage and kids much earlier than
they wish. For women, it means giving up the hope of seducing a Mr. Big, someone who has never shown signs of being serious
about committment, into long term committment and parenthood. And for men, if they are serious about family,
that means dating women who are actually ready for such a thing and making themselves availabe and attractive to them,
rather than continuing to take a swing at the extremely attractive out-of-college crowd. Oh, and leave off the
self pity about "women not wanting a nice guy"; in the unlikely case that really and truly is your only problem,
you need to start hanging with a different crowd - and 
maybe start looking for partners with the traits that you claim others should
value in you.

### Sexual attraction is a poor way to select a long term mate

Back in the old days, it was presumed that one would find their marriage partner in high school (!)
or college. No matter how someone might long for those days, it has little to recommend it. People who
get married very early in life are responsible for the bulk of the divorices that occur. 

Ideally, the collapse
of this world view should lead to happier marriages somewhat later in life, complete with children. People would
be exposed to more partners, grow psychologically, know more about who they are compatible with, and after years
of dating and "finding themselves," would marry someone uniquely suited to them. Certainly nobod expected
a fallof in family formation and a collapse in child birth. Yet that is precisely what happened. The cause is unfortunately
a side effect of the way most people think about relationships after the sexual revolution.

People are prone to think in stories and narration, particularly young people mapping out their lives, and a common
script of those exiting college is generally the following:
"In my twenties, I'm going to have fun and date lots of attrative, glamourous men/women. I will tire of
it, and in my thirties I'll actually _get serious_ and start seriously dating. I will meet _the one_ and
we'll get married hand have children."

This is not how the real world works. How much success you have in dating is unfortunately very little
under your control. If you are among the unhappy, you will find it hard to enter into any relationship
where there is a mutual attraction, making this entire thing moot. But hopefully you'll find some luck with
romance. In which case, romance will take you by the hand, and you will enter into a phase called
"serial monogomy." You'll date someone you're smitten with, eventually leading to the long-term relationship,
even cohabitation, until the primarily sexual attraction wears off and you're forced to break up due
to your differences. Rinse, cycle, repeat throughout your twenties. So much for dating selectively
with an eye toward your happiness.

This is particularly a problem for women in their thirties or somewhat older men; they have had little
experience kissing frogs, and when it's time to "get practical,"
The unfortunate result for some is that none of those long-term relationships work out. When that happens,
people 

The eventual result for the relationship-minded, is that if you're lucky, things will work out.
Unfortunately, the idea of dating around for compatibility relationship-minded, by the end of your twenties, no matter how mucy you had planned to "date around,"
you will find yourself in a relationship with a long term partner. It may be time to get serious, but
if your partner is not ready or not quite what you wanted, you have to deal with _that_.

Unfortunately for many, the partner-they-have was found during "the fun phase," when one wasn't that
picky about character and compatible goals. But now being in a relationship with someone they are still
terribly attracted to, the problem is what to do. The solution for many is to do nothing; books like
_Fertility on Ice_ document the struggles of many women who want to get married but are entagled in serious
relationships. It isn't just a case of a bad breakup; frequently these are cohabiting women that are
married-in-practice if not enjoying the legal protection of married-in-fact, and any breakup is going
to have the same emotional impact as a divorice.

The problem, once again, is the sexual revolution. Or rather, the permanent adolesence that it lulls many
young single people into. There have been surveys that ask people when they believe they are "ready for
marriage." One would hope that most people would answer when they are mature enough to properly identify
a suitable life partner. That is not the answer most people give; instead, the answer seems to be
"when it stops being much fun being single." Not surprisingly, this happens after their attractiveness in
the dating marketplace has peaked. Many blue-collar men say they are ready to marry at twenty-five; not
surprising, given how many women in their twenties require only educated suitors. The most attractive men - the
tall, very educated professionals - often indicate they are ready in their mid-thirties or even later.

This lays a trap for many young women - in their early- or mid-twenties, they may
feel it is far to early to search for a suitable life partner, but this is unfortunately the time of their
life where they are the most attractive to men and likely to be inundated with attention, wanted and
otherwise, and particularly to men looking for strictly physical relationships without any possibility
of marriage. The time when they are likely to "get serious" is a time when they may no longer be getting
attention from the sort of men they like. While I know this advice will not be eagerly received by 
many, the solution is evident: stop dating-for-fun while it is still fun.

### Family formation takes cultural involvement


### Sex is the most important thing only when you're young and have none


\* There are two risk factors that are responsible for the vast majority of divorices:
1) getting married too early in life;
2) getting married too quickly.
In the northeast where I live, this is far less common than other parts in the country. The
divorce rate is actually far less - perhaps 35%, and even lower for first marriages. This is
in spite of its reputation among some parts of America as being an immoral hellhole.
