#OF WHAT USE IS A RIGHT-WING AUTHORITARIAN?

Those of you cynical enough to be reading this block may be tempted to
apply "Betteridge's Rule of Headlines." I urge you to hold off for the
moment.

points:
* Baha'i faith attempts to use _all_ viewpoints
* Present troubles are caused by virulent strains of authoritarianism
* All indications are that right-wing authoritarianism is a
personality type. There are certain theories, but there is every
reason to believe this is an innate inclination and is difficult to
change.
* Discussions regarding authoritarian personalities have heretofor
framed them in terms of a "problem to be solved." Rather than simply
bet on finding a cure, it would be much better if one could use them
in the near term for the strengths they have, and direct these
strengths to a cause that will temper there extremist tendencies.
* The most obvious solution, then, is one in which authoritarians
claim membership in a group which is dedicated toward
the inculcation of non-authoritarian thinking and elimination of
prejudice and toward world unity. This may work due to the fact that
right-wing authoritarians generally have no idea they are unusual in
any nature and are far more driven by groupthink and a desire to
belong than actual authoritarian principles as such.

* The main problem with authoritarians themselves are the leaders they
  enable. They tend to select traditional "strong-leader" types and
  hold excessive loyalty to them. In particular, they tend to raise
  leaders high on the scale of "social dominance." In fact, the worst
  leaders are high on both social dominance and authoritarianism -
  borderline sociopaths that enjoy power for its own sake.
* As such, since the primary problem is the dyad of authoritarian
  followers and the socially dominant leaders, and one cannot
  eliminate the authoritarians, one is left to figure out how to purge
  socially dominant people from leadership.

* The Baha'i Faith's leadership selection tends to mitigate against
  attempts at the socially dominant to establish followers for
  themselves:
  - One may not run for election, or campaign
  - One may get oneself elected to assembly. If successful, then they
  have to deal with eight other believers. The only problem,
  therefore, is the unlikely situation where there is only one
  socially dominant person and a large  majority of authoritarian
  followers; those scoring low on authoritarianism are likely to push
  back hard.
  - Assembly membership itself is generally regarded as an improper
  platform for personal aggrandizement.
  - There are areas of informal authority that such people could
  serve; e.g. auxiliary board members. Those managing such people must
  take particular care to ensure only those of sound character are
  selected.

* Authoritarian followers themselves pose risks of a smaller
  nature. If leadership positions are filled with followers only,
  paralysis results; likewise, many have complained of over-eager
  attempts at protection of the faith.

* The solution, therefore, is to eliminate socially dominate
  tendencies, sidelines those who eliminate those tendencies, and
  leverage the strong points of authoritarian followers without at any
  time letting them dominate segments of community life, and over time
  presuming that spiritual growth will inculcate a more tolerant point
  of view.

* As far as those with low authoritarian tendencies, they should not
  be idealized either. The achilles' heel of this outlook can be found
  in individualism - live-and-let-live is generally accompanied by the
  belief that this should apply to oneself as well.
* Much has been said about this elsewhere. An interesting book on this
  viewpoint from the secular view is Jonathan Haidt's _The Righteous Mind_.
