#OF WHAT USE IS A RIGHT-WING AUTHORITARIAN?

Those of you cynical enough to be reading this block may be tempted to
apply "Betteridge's Rule of Headlines." I urge you to hold off for the
moment.

points:
* Baha'i faith attempts to use _all_ viewpoints
* Present troubles are caused by virulent strains of authoritarianism
* All indications are that right-wing authoritarianism is a
personality type. There are certain theories, but there is every
reason to believe this is an innate inclination and is difficult to
change.
* Discussions regarding authoritarian personalities have heretofor
framed them in terms of a "problem to be solved." Rather than simply
bet on finding a cure, it would be much better if one could use them
in the near term for the strengths they have, and direct these
strengths to a cause that will temper there extremist tendencies.
* Bob Altemeyer's book _The Authorotarians) is a particular
comprehensive book on 
authoritarian personalities, with a particular emphasis on political
slant. It has been influential in "the left," due to the unexpected
results of the 2016 election. Unfortunately, its political slant is
evident, to some extent burying the fact that such personalities are
different, not inferior, and very context dependent. In particular,
authorotariansm measures one's attitued toward authority _only_, and
obviously when a question uppermost in your mind is "who is most
resistent to the appeals of evil men," those more highly deferential
to authority will come out on the short end of the stick. Jonathan Haidt's
book _The Righteous Mind_, no not on authoritariansm as such, is
critical of individualism in morality (that is, those who score very
*low* on the authoritarian scale), and gives a
more balanced viewpoint of those who might otherwise seem off.
* The most obvious solution, then, is one in which authoritarians
claim membership in a group which is dedicated toward
the inculcation of non-authoritarian thinking and elimination of
prejudice and toward world unity. This may work due to the fact that
right-wing authoritarians generally have no idea they are unusual in
any nature and are far more driven by groupthink and a desire to
belong than actual authoritarian principles as such.

* The main problem with authoritarians themselves are the leaders they
  enable. They tend to select traditional "strong-leader" types and
  hold excessive loyalty to them. In particular, they tend to raise
  leaders high on the scale of "social dominance." In fact, the worst
  leaders are high on both social dominance and authoritarianism -
  borderline sociopaths that enjoy power for its own sake.
* As such, since the primary problem is the dyad of authoritarian
  followers and the socially dominant leaders, and one cannot
  eliminate the authoritarians, one is left to figure out how to purge
  socially dominant people from leadership.
* The Baha'i Faith's leadership selection tends to mitigate against
  attempts at the socially dominant to establish followers for
  themselves:
  - One may not run for election, or campaign
  - One may get oneself elected to assembly. If successful, then they
  have to deal with eight other believers. The only problem,
  therefore, is the unlikely situation where there is only one
  socially dominant person and a large  majority of authoritarian
  followers; those scoring low on authoritarianism are likely to push
  back hard.
  - Assembly membership itself is generally regarded as an improper
  platform for personal aggrandizement.
  - There are areas of informal authority that such people could
  serve; e.g. auxiliary board members. Those managing such people must
  take particular care to ensure only those of sound character are
  selected.

* Authoritarian followers themselves pose risks of a smaller
  nature. If leadership positions are filled with followers only,
  paralysis results; likewise, many have complained of over-eager
  attempts at protection of the faith.

* The solution, therefore, is to eliminate socially dominate
  tendencies, sidelines those who eliminate those tendencies, and
  leverage the strong points of authoritarian followers without at any
  time letting them dominate segments of community life, and over time
  presuming that spiritual growth will inculcate a more tolerant point
  of view.

* As far as those with low authoritarian tendencies, they should not
  be idealized either. The achilles' heel of this outlook can be found
  in individualism - live-and-let-live is generally accompanied by the
  belief that this should apply to oneself as well.

* In general, one problem with this scale is that it measures everyone
  on a single element, and elides a number of significant distinctions
  between viewpoints of authority

#So why is this important anyway?

At one level, it is important not to make too much of this. To an
extent that it is an important characterization of political behavior,
it is important, but not a sole determination. It is quite easy to
make too much of this.
* However, this does affect how "teaching" is done. For the most part
Baha'is have had their work cut out for them. Those most willing to
give an ear are those of a "low authority" mindset, who are more than
willing to embrace the open-minded teachings of the Baha'i
Faith... but are then reluctant to pledge any sort of allegiance. Or
after they do, it then becomes a portfolio in one's belief system. In
essense, Baha'is recruit "low authoritarian" believers, than wish that
they were behaving as they had "high authoritarian" once they
joined. It doesn't work that way, of course.
* As far as "high authoritarian" mindsets, generally this is not a
teaching focus. This is not without cause; Baha'is obviously are not
going to look where there is no hearing given. Loud arguments do not
believers make. Baha'is in Iran had little luck converting the
hardcore "true believers" in Islam, and they will have little luck
here. This is in spite of the fact that inside the community, it might
even be better if more "high authoritarians" could serve as backbone
of the community - provided, of course, their self-righteous streak
could be held in check to keep from pushing away less dedicated
believers who nevertheless have a right to belong in the Faith.

* The question, is what is to be done. The issue is not so much but
  when - it is a question of timing.
* Authoritarian believers are, bluntly, pigheaded to an unusual
  extreme, and noreceptive. However, there are times at which they
  become extremely open and lost - in response to a serious betrayel
  of trust by their leaders.
* We are coming to a time where it is very likely, in the next few
  years, that this loss of trust is at hand. Let us look at American
  evangelicals - perhaps the largest, most coherent group of high
  authoritarians in society.
  - They have been led by religious leaders into making bargians with
  the lowest of characters, for political power. Power that will not
  keep their congregations from shrinking and will not spread their
  values.
  - They are lead by political leaders who give lip service to their
  values, all the while, openly flaunting the spirit of their
  teachings and making cause with obvious materialists.
  - They are about to be betrayed by said leaders to the effect that
  they will feel an obvious decline in their standard of living due to
  policies they will enact
  - likewise, they will stop feeling like they
  "fit in" to their own societies due to obvious lack of public
  acclaim (authoritarians frequently feel that almost everyone feels
  exactly the same way they do, and are shocked when they experience
  firsthand knowledge of the fact that their opinions are out of step
  with others they respect).
* As such, we are upon a rare window when such people will have an
  unusual degree of receptivity to other belief systems.

One key is that authoritarians tend to look at beliefs they want to
believe in - they are reluctant to rethink things, but may in fact
find reconceptualizations that cause them to change their beliefs
suitable, if they themselves can believe that they did not have to
change their "core beliefs."
