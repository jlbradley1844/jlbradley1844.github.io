## Uncontrolled, immoderate extremes of wealth and poverty;

Allow not the abject to rule over and dominate them who are noble 
and worthy of honor, and suffer not the high-minded to be at the mercy 
of the contemptible and worthless, for this is what We observed upon 
Our arrival in the City (Constantinople), and to it We bear witness. 
We found among its inhabitants some who were possessed of an affluent 
fortune and lived in the midst of excessive riches, while others were 
in dire want and abject poverty.
	(Baha'u'llah, Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 212)

Wealth is most commendable, provided the entire population is wealthy. 
If, however, a few have inordinate riches while the rest are impoverished, 
and no fruit or benefit accrues from that wealth, then it is only a 
liability to its possessor.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 24)

One of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings is the adjustment of means of livelihood in 
human society. Under this adjustment there can be no extremes in human conditions 
as regards wealth and sustenance. For the community needs financier, farmer, 
merchant and laborer just as an army must be composed of commander, officers and 
privates. All cannot be commanders; all cannot be officers or privates. Each 
in his station in the social fabric must be competent -- each in his function 
according to ability but with justness of opportunity for all.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 216)

Each one of you must have great consideration for the poor and render them 
assistance. Organize in an effort to help them and prevent increase of poverty. 
The greatest means for prevention is that whereby the laws of the community 
will be so framed and enacted that it will not be possible for a few to 
be millionaires and many destitute.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 216)

## Short-sighted destruction of natural habitats and wasteful explotation of naural resources;

This is the Day whereon the earth shall tell out her tidings. The workers of 
iniquity are her burdens, could ye but perceive it.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah, p. 99)

In all matters moderation is desirable. If a thing is carried to excess, it 
will prove a source of evil. Consider the civilization of the West, how it 
hath agitated and alarmed the peoples of the world. An infernal engine hath 
been devised, and hath proved so cruel a weapon of destruction that its like 
none hath ever witnessed or heard. The purging of such deeply-rooted and 
overwhelming corruptions cannot be effected unless the peoples of the world 
unite in pursuit of one common aim and embrace one universal faith.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 68)

Strange and astonishing things exist in the earth but they are hidden from 
the minds and the understanding of men. These things are capable of changing 
the whole atmosphere of the earth and their contamination would prove lethal.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 69)

Nature is God's Will and is its expression in and through the contingent world. 
It is a dispensation of Providence ordained by the Ordainer, the All-Wise. 
Were anyone to affirm that it is the Will of God as manifested in the world 
of being, no one should question this assertion. It is endowed with a power 
whose reality men of learning fail to grasp. Indeed a man of insight can 
perceive naught therein save the effulgent splendour of Our Name, the Creator.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 142)

Several times calamities have overtaken you, and yet ye failed utterly to take heed.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 163)

Though this world be fraught with deception and deceit, yet it continually
warneth all men of their impending extinction. The death of the father
proclaimeth to the son that he, too, shall pass away.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 168)

O YE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD!
Know, verily, that an unforeseen calamity followeth you, and grievous
retribution awaiteth you. Think not that which ye have committed hath been
effaced in My sight. By My beauty! All your doings hath My pen graven with open
characters upon tablets of chrysolite.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Persian Hidden Words)

## Inability of large segments of society to think critically, rendering them vulnerable to propaganda and misuse at the hands of others;

They cut off their own limbs and perceive it not; they deprive themselves of
that which is best for them, and know it not. They are even as a young child
who can distinguish neither the mischief-maker from the reformer nor the wicked
from the righteous. We behold them in this Day wrapt in a palpable veil.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 92)

Again concerning the divines of the Latter Days, He saith: "The religious
doctors of that age shall be the most wicked of the divines beneath the shadow
of heaven. Out of them hath mischief proceeded, and unto them it shall return."
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 117)

Beware, O My loved ones, lest ye despise the merits of My learned servants whom
God hath graciously chosen to be the exponents of His Name 'the Fashioner'
amidst mankind. Exert your utmost endeavour that ye may develop such
crafts and undertakings that everyone, whether young or old, may benefit
therefrom. We are quit of those ignorant ones who fondly imagine that Wisdom is
to give vent to one's idle imaginings and to repudiate God, the Lord of all
men; even as We hear some of the heedless voicing such assertions today.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 150)

Leaders of religion, in every age, have hindered their people from attaining
the shores of eternal salvation, inasmuch as they held the reins of authority
in their mighty grasp. Some for the lust of leadership, others through want of
knowledge and understanding, have been the cause of the deprivation of the
people.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 12)

Know verily that Knowledge is of two kinds: Divine and Satanic. The one welleth
out from the fountain of divine inspiration; the other is but a reflection of
vain and obscure thoughts. The source of the former is God Himself; the
motive-force of the latter the whisperings of selfish desire.... the former
bringeth forth the fruit of patience, of longing desire, of true understanding,
and love; whilst the latter can yield naught but arrogance, vainglory and
conceit.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 68)

We behold it [the nation], in this day, at the mercy of rulers so drunk with
pride that they cannot discern clearly their own best advantage, much less
recognize a Revelation so bewildering and challenging as this. And whenever any
one of them hath striven to improve its condition, his motive hath been his own
gain, whether confessedly so or not; and the unworthiness of this motive hath
limited his power to heal or cure.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah, p. 63)

## The continuing appeal of superstition and "magical thinking" in the solution to social problems;

Knowledge is one of the wondrous gifts of God. It is incumbent upon everyone to acquire it.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 39)
`
Knowledge is as wings to man's life, and a ladder for his ascent. Its
acquisition is incumbent upon everyone. The knowledge of such sciences,
however, should be acquired as can profit the peoples of the earth, and not
those which begin with words and end with words. Great indeed is the claim of
scientists and craftsmen on the peoples of the world.
        (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 50)

People for the most part delight in superstitions. They regard a single drop of
the sea of delusion as preferable to an ocean of certitude. By holding fast
unto names they deprive themselves of the inner reality and by clinging to vain
imaginings they are kept back from the Dayspring of heavenly signs.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 57)

Respect ye the divines and learned amongst you, they whose conduct accords with
their professions, who transgress not the bounds which God hath fixed, whose
judgements are in conformity with His behests as revealed in His Book. Know ye
that they are the lamps of guidance unto them that are in the heavens and on
the earth. They who disregard and neglect the divines and learned that live
amongst them -- these have truly changed the favour with which God hath
favoured them.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 202)

Resort ye, in times of sickness, to competent physicians; We have not set aside
the use of material means, rather have We confirmed it through this Pen,
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 60)

Promote ye the development of the cities of God and His countries...
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 77)

These people with one hand cling to those verses of the Qur'án and those
traditions of the people of certitude which they have found to accord with
their inclinations and interests, and with the other reject those which are
contrary to their selfish desires.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 167)

Among the sciences which this pretender hath professed is that of alchemy. We
cherish the hope that either a king or a man of preeminent power may call upon
him to translate this science from the realm of fancy to the domain of fact and
from the plane of mere pretension to that of actual achievement.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 188)

The people of Baha should not deny any soul the reward due to him, should treat
craftsmen with deference, and, unlike the people aforetime, should not defile
their tongues with abuse.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 37)

## The persistence of racial prejudice and tribal preferentialism;

O ye men of wisdom among nations! Shut your eyes to estrangement, then fix your
gaze upon unity. Cleave tenaciously unto that which will lead to the well-being
and tranquillity of all mankind. This span of earth is but one homeland and one
habitation. It behoveth you to abandon vainglory which causeth alienation and
to set your hearts on whatever will ensure harmony. In the estimation of
the people of Baha man's glory lieth in his knowledge, his upright conduct, his
praiseworthy character, his wisdom, and not in his nationality or rank.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 66)

O people! Consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of
friendliness and fellowship.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 21)

They who exhort others unto justice, while themselves committing iniquity,
stand accused of falsehood by the inmates of the Kingdom and by those who
circle round the throne of their Lord, the Almighty, the Beneficent, for that
which their tongues have uttered. Commit not, O people, that which dishonoureth
your name and the fair name of the Cause of God amongst men. Beware lest ye
approach that which your minds abhor.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 77)

In brief, dissensions among various sects have opened the way to weakness. Each
sect hath picked out a way for itself and is clinging to a certain cord.
Despite manifest blindness and ignorance they pride themselves on their insight
and knowledge.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 60)


We have also heard that thou [Queen Victoria] hast entrusted the reins of
counsel into the hands of the representatives of the people. Thou, indeed, hast
done well, for thereby the foundations of the edifice of thine affairs will be
strengthened, and the hearts of all that are beneath thy shadow, whether high
or low, will be tranquillized. It behoveth them, however, to be trustworthy
among His servants, and to regard themselves as the representatives of all that
dwell on earth.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 89)

Sedition hath never been pleasing unto God, nor were the acts committed in the
past by certain foolish ones acceptable in His sight. Know ye that to be killed
in the path of His good pleasure is better for you than to kill. The beloved of
the Lord must, in this day, behave in such wise amidst His servants that they
may by their very deeds and actions guide all men unto the paradise of the
All-Glorious.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 110)

The reason for which all these things have come to pass is that their
persecutors, finding these unfortunate ones without protection, have forgone
more weighty matters and occupied themselves instead with harassing this
afflicted people.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 119)

Beware that thou allow not the wolf to become the shepherd of God's flock, and
surrender not the fate of His loved ones to the mercy of the malicious. Expect
not that they who violate the ordinances of God will be trustworthy or sincere
in the faith they profess. Avoid them, and preserve strict guard over thyself,
lest their devices and mischief hurt thee.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 210)

That seeker should also regard backbiting as grievous error, and keep himself
aloof from its dominion, inasmuch as backbiting quencheth the light of the
heart, and extinguisheth the life of the soul. He should be content with
little, and be freed from all inordinate desire.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 192)

O SON OF EARTH!
Know, verily, the heart wherein the least remnant of envy yet lingers, shall
never attain My everlasting dominion, nor inhale the sweet savors of holiness
breathing from My kingdom of sanctity.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Persian Hidden Words)

Every faction, in short, follows its own particular illusion.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 11)

## The coarsening and mistruth of civic discourse.

O FRIEND!
In the garden of thy heart plant naught but the rose of love, and from the
nightingale of affection and desire loosen not thy hold. Treasure the
companionship of the righteous and eschew all fellowship with the ungodly.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Persian Hidden Words)

Ye are the dawning-places of the love of God and the daysprings of His
loving-kindness. Defile not your tongues with the cursing and reviling of any
soul, and guard your eyes against that which is not seemly. Set forth that
which ye possess. If it be favourably received, your end is attained; if not,
to protest is vain. Leave that soul to himself and turn unto the Lord, the
Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Be not the cause of grief, much less of discord
and strife.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 129)

Governments should fully acquaint themselves with the conditions of those they
govern, and confer upon them positions according to desert and merit. It is
enjoined upon every ruler and sovereign to consider this matter with the utmost
care that the traitor may not usurp the position of the faithful, nor the
despoiler rule in the place of the trustworthy.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 126)

We behold it [the world], in this day, at the mercy of rulers so drunk with
pride that they cannot discern clearly their own best advantage, much less
recognize a Revelation so bewildering and challenging as this. And whenever any
one of them hath striven to improve its condition, his motive hath been his own
gain, whether confessedly so or not; and the unworthiness of this motive hath
limited his power to heal or cure.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 91)

So highly was he regarded that his praise was on every tongue, and his
righteousness and piety were universally acknowledged. Yet, when hostilities
broke out with Russia, he who himself had pronounced the decree of holy war,
and who with blazoned standard had left his native land to rally to the support
of his faith, abandoned, after the inconvenience of a brief encounter, all the
good that he had purposed, and returned whence he had come.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 113)

Be fair: Is the testimony of those acceptable and worthy of attention whose
deeds agree with their words, whose outward behaviour conforms with their inner
life? The mind is bewildered at their deeds, and the soul marvelleth at their
fortitude and bodily endurance. Or is the testimony of these faithless souls
who breathe naught but the breath of selfish desire, and who lie imprisoned in
the cage of their idle fancies, acceptable? Like the bats of darkness, they
lift not their heads from their couch except to pursue the transient things of
the world, and find no rest by night except as they labour to advance the aims
of their sordid life. Immersed in their selfish schemes, they are oblivious of
the divine Decree. In the day-time they strive with all their soul after
worldly benefits, and in the night-season their sole occupation is to gratify
their carnal desires. By what law or standard could men be justified in
cleaving to the denials of such petty-minded souls, and in ignoring the faith
of them that have renounced, for the sake of the good-pleasure of God, their
life, and substance, their fame and renown, their reputation and honour?
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 223)

The pages of swiftly-appearing newspapers are indeed the mirror of the world.
They reflect the deeds and the pursuits of divers peoples and kindreds. They
both reflect them and make them known. They are a mirror endowed with hearing,
sight and speech. This is an amazing and potent phenomenon. However, it
behoveth the writers thereof to be purged from the promptings of evil
passions and desires and to be attired with the raiment of justice and equity.
They should enquire into situations as much as possible and ascertain the
facts, then set them down in writing.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 39)

## A crass libertarian materialism that seeks to label any moneymaking venture as inherently worthy, no matter what undesireable side-effects may result.

Consider the pettiness of men's minds. They ask for that which injureth them,
and cast away the thing that profiteth them. They are, indeed, of those that
are far astray. We find some men desiring liberty, and priding themselves
therein. Such men are in the depths of ignorance.

Liberty must, in the end, lead to sedition, whose flames none can quench. Thus
warneth you He Who is the Reckoner, the All-Knowing. Know ye that the
embodiment of liberty and its symbol is the animal.  That which beseemeth man
is submission unto such restraints as will protect him from his own ignorance,
and guard him against the harm of the mischief-maker.  Liberty causeth man to
overstep the bounds of propriety, and to infringe on the dignity of his
station.  It debaseth him to the level of extreme depravity and wickedness.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 63)

O ye rich ones on earth! If ye encounter one who is poor, treat him not
disdainfully. Reflect upon that whereof ye were created. Every one of you was
created of a sorry germ.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 78)

Where are they who went in quest of earthly pleasures and the fruits of carnal
desires? Whither are fled their fair and comely women? Where are their swaying
branches, their spreading boughs, their lofty mansions, their trellised
gardens? And what of the delights of these gardens -- their exquisite grounds
and gentle breezes, their purling streams, their soughing winds, their cooing
doves and rustling leaves? Where now are their resplendent morns and their
brightsome countenances wreathed in smiles? Alas for them! All have perished
and are gone to rest beneath a canopy of dust. Of them one heareth neither name
nor mention; none knoweth of their affairs, and naught remaineth of their
signs.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 130)

## The elevation of paid work to the central concern of life, and a "hustle culture" that gorifies a committment to paid work at the expense of domestic life and public life;

We behold the generality of mankind worshipping names and exposing themselves,
as thou dost witness, to dire perils in the mere hope of perpetuating their
names, whilst every perceiving soul testifieth that after death one's name
shall avail him nothing except insofar as it beareth a relationship unto God,
the Almighty, the All-Praised. Thus have their vain imaginings taken hold of
them in requital for that which their hands have wrought. Consider the
pettiness of men's minds. They seek with utmost exertion that which profiteth
them not, and yet wert thou to ask of them: "Is there any advantage in that
which ye desire?", thou wouldst find them sorely perplexed.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 81)

O CHILDREN OF DUST!
Tell the rich of the midnight sighing of the poor, lest heedlessness lead them
into the path of destruction, and deprive them of the Tree of Wealth. To give
and to be generous are attributes of Mine; well is it with him that adorneth
himself with My virtues.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Persian Hidden Words)

## The exclusion of spiritual concerns from discussions of public life, and emptiness of public enterntainment and discourse;

Observe how darkness has overspread the world. In every corner of the earth
there is strife, discord and warfare of some kind. Mankind is submerged in the
sea of materialism and occupied with the affairs of this world. They have no
thought beyond earthly possessions and manifest no desire save the passions of
this fleeting, mortal existence. Their utmost purpose is the attainment of
material livelihood, physical comforts and worldly enjoyments such as
constitute the happiness of the animal world rather than the world of man.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 335)

What are the fruits of the human world? They are the spiritual attributes which
appear in man. If man is bereft of those attributes, he is like a fruitless
tree. One whose aspiration is lofty and who has developed self-reliance will
not be content with a mere animal existence.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 335)

How excellent, how honorable is man if he arises to fulfil his
responsibilities; how wretched and contemptible, if he shuts his eyes to the
welfare of society and wastes his precious life in pursuing his own selfish
interests and personal advantages. Supreme happiness is man's, and he beholds
the signs of God in the world and in the human soul, if he urges on the steed
of high endeavor in the arena of civilization and justice.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 2)

Consider to what a remarkable extent the spirituality of people has been
overcome by materialism so that spiritual susceptibility seems to have
vanished, divine civilization become decadent, and guidance and knowledge of
God no longer remain. All are submerged in the sea of materialism. Although
some attend churches and temples of worship and devotion, it is in accordance
with the traditions and imitations of their fathers and not for the
investigation of reality.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 220)

Know, furthermore, that the life of man proceedeth from the spirit, and the
spirit turneth to wheresoever the soul directeth it.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 152)

It is certain that spirituality will defeat materialism, that the heavenly will
subdue the human, and that through divine education the masses of mankind
generally will take great steps forward in all degrees of life -- except for
those who are blind and deaf and mute and dead.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, Selections from the Writings of Abdu'l-Baha, p. 191)

## An excessively individualism that cultivate a culture of shameless self-aggrandizement;

Exultest thou over the treasures thou dost possess, knowing they shall perish?
Rejoicest thou in that thou rulest a span of earth, when the whole world, in
the estimation of the people of Baha, is worth as much as the black in the eye
of a dead ant? Abandon it unto such as have set their affections upon it, and
turn thou unto Him Who is the Desire of the world. Whither are gone the proud
and their palaces? Gaze thou into their tombs, that thou mayest profit by this
example, inasmuch as We made it a lesson unto every beholder.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 81)

... they [the leaders] are not yet sufficiently advanced in their education to
have experienced the delights of dispensing justice or to have tasted the
exhilaration of promoting righteousness or to have drunk from the springs of a
clear conscience and a sincere intent. They have not properly understood that
man's supreme honor and real happiness lie in self-respect, in high resolves
and noble purposes, in integrity and moral quality, in immaculacy of mind. They
have, rather, imagined that their greatness consists in the accumulation, by
whatever means may offer, of worldly goods.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 18)

## The unreflective glorification of the weathy as the "deserving winners" of a meritocracy;

O YE THAT PRIDE YOURSELVES ON MORTAL RICHES!
Know ye in truth that wealth is a mighty barrier between the seeker and his
desire, the lover and his beloved. The rich, but for a few, shall in no wise
attain the court of His presence nor enter the city of content and resignation.
Well is it then with him, who, being rich, is not hindered by his riches from
the eternal kingdom, nor deprived by them of imperishable dominion.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Persian Hidden Words)

This poverty and these riches, this abasement and glory, this dominion, power,
and the like, upon which the eyes and hearts of these vain and foolish souls
are set, -- all these things fade into utter nothingness in that Court!
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 131)

Would it profit you in the least if, as ye fondly imagine, your names were to
endure? Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! Was the idol 'Uzza made any greater by
this, that its name lived on amidst the worshippers of names? Nay, by Him Who
is the Self of God, the All-Glorious, the All-Compelling! Should your names
fade from every mortal mind, and yet God be well pleased with you, ye will
indeed be numbered among the treasures of His name, the Most Hidden.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 45)

... the happiness and greatness, the rank and station, the pleasure and peace,
of an individual have never consisted in his personal wealth, but rather in his
excellent character, his high resolve, the breadth of his learning, and his
ability to solve difficult problems.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 23)

The highest righteousness of all is for blessed souls to take hold of the hands
of the helpless and deliver them out of their ignorance and abasement and
poverty, and with pure motives, and only for the sake of God, to arise and
energetically devote themselves to the service of the masses, forgetting their
own worldly advantage and working only to serve the general good.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 103)

O CHILDREN OF MEN!
Know ye not why We created you all from the same dust? That no one should exalt
himself over the other. Ponder at all times in your hearts how ye were created.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Arabic Hidden Words)

## The "perpetual adolescence" cultivated in young adults and the postponement of mature relationships until their final childbearing years (note: men have biological clocks too);

Beware lest the desires of the flesh and of a corrupt inclination provoke
divisions among you.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 40)

Waste not your hours in idleness and sloth, but occupy yourselves with what
will profit you and others.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 30)

Enter into wedlock, O people, that ye may bring forth one who will make mention
of Me amid My servants. This is My bidding unto you; hold fast to it as an
assistance to yourselves.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 41)

Take heed lest the world beguile you as it beguiled the people who went before
you!
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 44)

It is inadmissible that man, who hath been endowed with reason, should consume
that which stealeth it away.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 62)

Beware of using any substance that induceth sluggishness and torpor in the
human temple and inflicteth harm upon the body.  
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 75)

## A reflexive relativism that refuses to label recognized blameworthy behaviors as such.

That which the aforesaid persons have mentioned concerning the stations of
Divine Unity will conduce in no small measure to idleness and vain imaginings.
These mortal men have evidently set aside the differences of station and have
come to regard themselves as God, while God is immeasurably exalted above all
things. Every created being however revealeth His signs which are but
emanations from Him and not His Own Self.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 60)

In these days it is incumbent upon everyone to adhere tenaciously unto unity
and concord and to labour diligently in promoting the Cause of God, that
perchance the wayward souls may attain that which will lead unto abiding
prosperity.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 58)

Say: Honesty, virtue, wisdom and a saintly character redound to the exaltation
of man, while dishonesty, imposture, ignorance and hypocrisy lead to his
abasement. By My life! Man's distinction lieth not in ornaments or wealth, but
rather in virtuous behaviour and true understanding.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 57)

Some heedless souls roam the lands in the name of God, actively engaged in
ruining His Cause, and call it promoting and teaching the Word of God; and this
notwithstanding that the qualifications of the teachers of the Faith, like unto
stars, shine resplendent throughout the heavens of the divine Tablets.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 57)

## Other Stuff

Here we comprehend according to environment and adaptation. This world is not
much of a place for the realization of truth. This world is but the womb of the
world of reality.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, Divine Philosophy, p. 112)

The violent derangement of the world's equilibrium; 
the trembling that will seize the limbs of mankind; 
the radical transformation of human society; 
the rolling up of the present-day Order; 
the fundamental changes affecting the structure of government; 
the weakening of the pillars of religion; 
the rise of dictatorships; the spread of tyranny; the fall of monarchies; 
the decline of ecclesiastical institutions; 
the increase of anarchy and chaos; 
the extension and consolidation of the Movement of the Left; 
the fanning into flame of the smouldering fire of racial strife; 
the development of infernal engines of war; 
the burning of cities; 
the contamination of the atmosphere of the earth -- 
these stand out as the signs and portents that must either herald or accompany
the retributive calamity which, as decreed by Him Who is the Judge and Redeemer
of mankind, must, sooner or later, afflict a society which, for the most part,
and for over a century, has turned a deaf ear to the Voice of God's Messenger
in this day -- a calamity which must purge the human race of the dross of its
age-long corruptions, and weld its component parts into a firmly-knit
world-embracing Fellowship
	(Shoghi Effendi, Messages to the Baha'i World - 1950-1957, p. 103)

Beware lest ye shed the blood of anyone. Unsheathe the sword of your tongue
from the scabbard of utterance, for therewith ye can conquer the citadels of
men's hearts. We have abolished the law to wage holy war against each other.
God's mercy, hath, verily, encompassed all created things, if ye do but
understand. Aid ye your Lord, the God of Mercy, with the sword of
understanding. Keener indeed is it, and more finely tempered, than the sword of
utterance, were ye but to reflect upon the words of your Lord.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 21)

O people! Dispute not concerning My Cause, for ye shall never fathom the
manifold wisdom of your Lord, nor shall ye ever gauge the knowledge of Him Who
is the All-Glorious, the All-Pervading. Whosoever layeth claim to have known
His Essence is without doubt among the most ignorant of all people. Every
atom in the universe would charge such a man with imposture, and to this
beareth witness My tongue which speaketh naught but the truth. Magnify My Cause
and promulgate My teachings and commandments, for none other course beside this
shall beseem you, and no other path shall ever lead unto Him.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 37)

Consider the Black Stone, which God hath made a point whereunto all men turn in
adoration. Hath this bounty been conferred upon it by virtue of its innate
excellence? Nay, by Mine own Self!
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 48)

Narrate, O Servant, the things Thou didst behold at the time of Thine arrival
in the City, that Thy testimony may endure amongst men, and serve as a warning
unto them that believe. We found, upon Our arrival in the City, its governors
and elders as children gathered about and disporting themselves with clay. We
perceived no one sufficiently mature to acquire from Us the truths which God
hath taught Us, nor ripe for Our wondrous words of wisdom. Our inner eye wept
sore over them, and over their transgressions and their total disregard of the
thing for which they were created.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 200)

To every discerning and illumined heart it is evident that God, the unknowable
Essence, the divine Being, is immensely exalted beyond every human attribute,
such as corporeal existence, ascent and descent, egress and regress.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 97)

Behold, all the people are imprisoned within the tomb of self, and lie buried
beneath the nethermost depths of worldly desire!
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 119)

If numbers and excellence of apparel be regarded as the criterions of learning
and truth, the peoples of a bygone age, whom those of today have never
surpassed in numbers, magnificence and power, should certainly be accounted a
superior and worthier people.
	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 165)

O servants! This nether world is the abode of demons: Guard yourselves from
approaching them. By demons is meant those wayward souls who, with the burden
of their evil deeds, slumber in the chambers of oblivion. Their sleep is
preferable to their wakefulness, and their death is better than their life.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tabernacle of Unity)

Waste not your time in idleness and sloth. Occupy yourselves with that which
profiteth yourselves and others.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 26)

Be thou of one face in the path of God. When in company with the infidels, thou
art an infidel and with the pious, thou art pious.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 42)

Gracious God! It was intended that at the time of the manifestation of the One
true God the faculty of recognizing Him would have been developed and matured
and would have reached its culmination. However, it is now clearly demonstrated
that in the disbelievers this faculty hath remained undeveloped and hath,
indeed, degenerated.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 52)

This Wronged One hath invariably treated the wise with affection. By the wise
is meant men whose knowledge is not confined to mere words and whose lives have
been fruitful and have produced enduring results. It is incumbent upon everyone
to honour these blessed souls.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 61)

Verily I say: The greater the decline of religion, the more grievous the
waywardness of the ungodly. This cannot but lead in the end to chaos and
confusion.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 63)

The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the eighth leaf of the
Most Exalted Paradise is the following: Schools must first train the children
in the principles of religion, so that the Promise and the Threat recorded in
the Books of God may prevent them from the things forbidden and adorn them with
the mantle of the commandments; but this in such a measure that it may not
injure the children by resulting in ignorant fanaticism and bigotry.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 66)

Leave ye unto themselves the immature ones of the world -- they that are moved
by selfish desire and cling to the exponents of idle fancy.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 79)

Strife and conflict befit the beasts of the wild. It was through the grace of
God and with the aid of seemly words and praiseworthy deeds that the unsheathed
swords of the Bábí community were returned to their scabbards. Indeed through
the power of good words, the righteous have always succeeded in winning command
over the meads of the hearts of men. S
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 84)

Arise, O people, and, by the power of God's might, resolve to gain the victory
over your own selves, that haply the whole earth may be freed and sanctified
from its servitude to the gods of its idle fancies -- gods that have inflicted
such loss upon, and are responsible for the misery of their wretched
worshippers. These idols form the obstacle that impedeth man in his efforts to
advance in the path of perfection. We cherish the hope that the Hand of divine
power may lend its assistance to mankind and deliver it from its state of
grievous abasement.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 86)

The unbelievers and the faithless have set their minds on four things: first,
the shedding of blood; second, the burning of books; third, the shunning of the
followers of other religions; fourth, the extermination of other communities
and groups. Now however, through the strengthening grace and potency of the
Word of God these four barriers have been demolished, these clear injunctions
have been obliterated from the Tablet and brutal dispositions have been
transmuted into spiritual attributes.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 91)

In the abundance of Our grace and loving-kindness We have revealed specially
for the rulers and ministers of the world that which is conducive to safety and
protection, tranquillity and peace; haply the children of men may rest secure
from the evils of oppression. He, verily, is the Protector, the Helper, the
Giver of victory
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 124)

It is obvious that not until the people are educated, not until public opinion
is rightly focused, not until government officials, even minor ones, are free
from even the least remnant of corruption, can the country be properly
administered. Not until discipline, order and good government reach the degree
where an individual, even if he should put forth his utmost efforts to do so,
would still find himself unable to deviate by so much as a hair's breadth from
righteousness, can the desired reforms be regarded as fully established.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 14)

It is unquestionable that the object in establishing parliaments is to bring
about justice and righteousness, but everything hinges on the efforts of the
elected representatives. If their intention is sincere, desirable results and
unforeseen improvements will be forthcoming; if not, it is certain that the
whole thing will be meaningless, the country will come to a standstill and
public affairs will continuously deteriorate. "I see a thousand builders
unequal to one subverter; what then of the one builder who is followed by a
thousand subverters?"
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 22)
