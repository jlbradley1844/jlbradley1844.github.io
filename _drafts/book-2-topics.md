## Uncontrolled, immoderate extremes of wealth and poverty;

Allow not the abject to rule over and dominate them who are noble 
and worthy of honor, and suffer not the high-minded to be at the mercy 
of the contemptible and worthless, for this is what We observed upon 
Our arrival in the City (Constantinople), and to it We bear witness. 
We found among its inhabitants some who were possessed of an affluent 
fortune and lived in the midst of excessive riches, while others were 
in dire want and abject poverty.
	(Baha'u'llah, Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 212)

Wealth is most commendable, provided the entire population is wealthy. 
If, however, a few have inordinate riches while the rest are impoverished, 
and no fruit or benefit accrues from that wealth, then it is only a 
liability to its possessor.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 24)

One of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings is the adjustment of means of livelihood in human society. Under this adjustment there can be no extremes in human conditions as regards wealth and sustenance. For the community needs financier, farmer, merchant and laborer just as an army must be composed of commander, officers and privates. All cannot be commanders; all cannot be officers or privates. Each in his station in the social fabric must be competent -- each in his function according to ability but with justness of opportunity for all.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 216)

Each one of you must have great consideration for the poor and render them assistance. Organize in an effort to help them and prevent increase of poverty. The greatest means for prevention is that whereby the laws of the community will be so framed and enacted that it will not be possible for a few to be millionaires and many destitute.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 216)

## Short-sighted destruction of natural habitats and wasteful explotation of naural resources;

Strange and astonishing things exist in the earth but they are hidden from the minds and the understanding of men. These things are capable of changing the whole atmosphere of the earth and their contamination would prove lethal.
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 69)

Several times calamities have overtaken you, and yet ye failed utterly to take heed.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 163)

Though this world be fraught with deception and deceit, yet it continually warneth all men of their impending extinction. The death of the father proclaimeth to the son that he, too, shall pass away. W

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 168)


## Inability of large segments of society to think critically, rendering them vulnerable to propaganda and misuse at the hands of others;

They cut off their own limbs and perceive it not; they deprive themselves of that which is best for them, and know it not. They are even as a young child who can distinguish neither the mischief-maker from the reformer nor the wicked from the righteous. We behold them in this Day wrapt in a palpable veil.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 92)

Again concerning the divines of the Latter Days, He saith: "The religious doctors of that age shall be the most wicked of the divines beneath the shadow of heaven. Out of them hath mischief proceeded, and unto them it shall return."

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 117)



## The continuing appeal of superstition and "magical thinking" in the solution to social problems;

Respect ye the divines and learned amongst you, they whose conduct accords with their professions, who transgress not the bounds which God hath fixed, whose judgements are in conformity with His behests as revealed in His Book. Know ye that they are the lamps of guidance unto them that are in the heavens and on the earth. They who disregard and neglect the divines and learned that live amongst them -- these have truly changed the favour with which God hath favoured them.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 202)


## The persistence of racial prejudice and tribal preferentialism;

They who exhort others unto justice, while themselves committing iniquity, stand accused of falsehood by the inmates of the Kingdom and by those who circle round the throne of their Lord, the Almighty, the Beneficent, for that which their tongues have uttered. Commit not, O people, that which dishonoureth your name and the fair name of the Cause of God amongst men. Beware lest ye approach that which your minds abhor.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 77)

We have also heard that thou [Queen Victoria] hast entrusted the reins of counsel into the hands of the representatives of the people. Thou, indeed, hast done well, for thereby the foundations of the edifice of thine affairs will be strengthened, and the hearts of all that are beneath thy shadow, whether high or low, will be tranquillized. It behoveth them, however, to be trustworthy among His servants, and to regard themselves as the representatives of all that dwell on earth.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 89)

Sedition hath never been pleasing unto God, nor were the acts committed in the past by certain foolish ones acceptable in His sight. Know ye that to be killed in the path of His good pleasure is better for you than to kill. The beloved of the Lord must, in this day, behave in such wise amidst His servants that they may by their very deeds and actions guide all men unto the paradise of the All-Glorious.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 110)

The reason for which all these things have come to pass is that their persecutors, finding these unfortunate ones without protection, have forgone more weighty matters and occupied themselves instead with harassing this afflicted people.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 119)

Beware that thou allow not the wolf to become the shepherd of God's flock, and surrender not the fate of His loved ones to the mercy of the malicious. Expect not that they who violate the ordinances of God will be trustworthy or sincere in the faith they profess. Avoid them, and preserve strict guard over thyself, lest their devices and mischief hurt thee.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 210)





## The coarsening and mistruth of civic discourse.

Governments should fully acquaint themselves with the conditions of those they govern, and confer upon them positions according to desert and merit. It is enjoined upon every ruler and sovereign to consider this matter with the utmost care that the traitor may not usurp the position of the faithful, nor the despoiler rule in the place of the trustworthy.

	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 126)

We behold it [the world], in this day, at the mercy of rulers so drunk with pride that they cannot discern clearly their own best advantage, much less recognize a Revelation so bewildering and challenging as this. And whenever any one of them hath striven to improve its condition, his motive hath been his own gain, whether confessedly so or not; and the unworthiness of this motive hath limited his power to heal or cure.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 91)

So highly was he regarded that his praise was on every tongue, and his righteousness and piety were universally acknowledged. Yet, when hostilities broke out with Russia,21 he who himself had pronounced the decree of holy war, and who with blazoned standard had left his native land to rally to the support of his faith, abandoned, after the inconvenience of a brief encounter, all the good that he had purposed, and returned whence he had come.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 113)



## A crass libertarian materialism that seeks to label any moneymaking venture as inherently worthy, no matter what undesireable side-effects may result.

O ye rich ones on earth! If ye encounter one who is poor, treat him not disdainfully. Reflect upon that whereof ye were created. Every one of you was created of a sorry germ.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 78)

Where are they who went in quest of earthly pleasures and the fruits of carnal desires? Whither are fled their fair and comely women? Where are their swaying branches, their spreading boughs, their lofty mansions, their trellised gardens? And what of the delights of these gardens -- their exquisite grounds and gentle breezes, their purling streams, their soughing winds, their cooing doves and rustling leaves? Where now are their resplendent morns and their brightsome countenances wreathed in smiles? Alas for them! All have perished and are gone to rest beneath a canopy of dust. Of them one heareth neither name nor mention; none knoweth of their affairs, and naught remaineth of their signs.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 130)



## The elevation of paid work to the central concern of life, and a "hustle culture" that gorifies a committment to paid work at the expense of domestic life and public life;

We behold the generality of mankind worshipping names and exposing themselves, as thou dost witness, to dire perils in the mere hope of perpetuating their names, whilst every perceiving soul testifieth that after death one's name shall avail him nothing except insofar as it beareth a relationship unto God, the Almighty, the All-Praised. Thus have their vain imaginings taken hold of them in requital for that which their hands have wrought. Consider the pettiness of men's minds. They seek with utmost exertion that which profiteth them not, and yet wert thou to ask of them: "Is there any advantage in that which ye desire?", thou wouldst find them sorely perplexed.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 81)


## The exclusion of spiritual concerns from discussions of public life, and emptiness of public enterntainment and discourse;

Know, furthermore, that the life of man proceedeth from the spirit, and the spirit turneth to wheresoever the soul directeth it.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 152)


## An excessively individualism that cultivate a culture of shameless self-aggrandizement;

Exultest thou over the treasures thou dost possess, knowing they shall perish? Rejoicest thou in that thou rulest a span of earth, when the whole world, in the estimation of the people of Baha, is worth as much as the black in the eye of a dead ant? Abandon it unto such as have set their affections upon it, and turn thou unto Him Who is the Desire of the world. Whither are gone the proud and their palaces? Gaze thou into their tombs, that thou mayest profit by this example, inasmuch as We made it a lesson unto every beholder.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 81)


## The unreflective glorification of the weathy as the "deserving winners" of a meritocracy;

This poverty and these riches, this abasement and glory, this dominion, power, and the like, upon which the eyes and hearts of these vain and foolish souls are set, -- all these things fade into utter nothingness in that Court!

	(Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 131)

Would it profit you in the least if, as ye fondly imagine, your names were to endure? Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! Was the idol 'Uzza made any greater by this, that its name lived on amidst the worshippers of names? Nay, by Him Who is the Self of God, the All-Glorious, the All-Compelling! Should your names fade from every mortal mind, and yet God be well pleased with you, ye will indeed be numbered among the treasures of His name, the Most Hidden.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 45)


... the happiness and greatness, the rank and station, the pleasure and peace, of an individual have never consisted in his personal wealth, but rather in his excellent character, his high resolve, the breadth of his learning, and his ability to solve difficult  24  problems.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 23)

The highest righteousness of all is for blessed souls to take hold of the hands of the helpless and deliver them out of their ignorance and abasement and poverty, and with pure motives, and only for the sake of God, to arise and energetically devote themselves to the service of the masses, forgetting their own worldly advantage and working only to serve the general good.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 103)




## The "perpetual adolescence" cultivated in young adults and the postponement of mature relationships until their final childbearing years (note: men have biological clocks too);
## A reflexive relativism that refuses to label recognized blameworthy behaviors as such.

## Other Stuff

Here we comprehend according to environment and adaptation. This world is not much of a place for the realization of truth. This world is but the womb of the world of reality.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Divine Philosophy, p. 112)

The violent derangement of the world's equilibrium; the trembling that will seize the limbs of mankind; the radical transformation of human society; t

	(Shoghi Effendi, Messages to the Baha'i World - 1950-1957, p. 103)

The violent derangement of the world's equilibrium; 
the trembling that will seize the limbs of mankind; 
the radical transformation of human society; 
the rolling up of the present-day Order; 
the fundamental changes affecting the structure of government; 
the weakening of the pillars of religion; 
the rise of dictatorships; the spread of tyranny; the fall of monarchies; 
the decline of ecclesiastical institutions; 
the increase of anarchy and chaos; 
the extension and consolidation of the Movement of the Left; 
the fanning into flame of the smouldering fire of racial strife; 
the development of infernal engines of war; 
the burning of cities; 
the contamination of the atmosphere of the earth -- 
these stand out as the signs and portents that must either herald or accompany the retributive calamity which, as decreed by Him Who is the Judge and Redeemer of mankind, must, sooner or later, afflict a society which, for the most part, and for over a century, has turned a deaf ear to the Voice of God's Messenger in this day -- a calamity which must purge the human race of the dross of its age-long corruptions, and weld its component parts into a firmly-knit world-embracing Fellowship
	(Shoghi Effendi, Messages to the Baha'i World - 1950-1957, p. 103)

Beware lest ye shed the blood of anyone. Unsheathe the sword of your tongue from the scabbard of utterance, for therewith ye can conquer the citadels of men's hearts. We have abolished the law to wage holy war against each other. God's mercy, hath, verily, encompassed all created things, if ye do but understand. Aid ye your Lord, the God of Mercy, with the sword of understanding. Keener indeed is it, and more finely tempered, than the sword of utterance, were ye but to reflect upon the words of your Lord.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 21)

O people! Dispute not concerning My Cause, for ye shall never fathom the manifold wisdom of your Lord, nor shall ye ever gauge the knowledge of Him Who is the All-Glorious, the All-Pervading. Whosoever layeth claim to have known His Essence is without doubt among the most ignorant of all people.  38  Every atom in the universe would charge such a man with imposture, and to this beareth witness My tongue which speaketh naught but the truth. Magnify My Cause and promulgate My teachings and commandments, for none other course beside this shall beseem you, and no other path shall ever lead unto Him.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 37)

Consider the Black Stone, which God hath made a point whereunto all men turn in adoration. Hath this bounty been conferred upon it by virtue of its innate excellence? Nay, by Mine own Self!

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 48)

Narrate, O Servant, the things Thou didst behold at the time of Thine arrival in the City, that Thy testimony may endure amongst men, and serve as a warning unto them that believe. We found, upon Our arrival in the City, its governors and elders as children gathered about and disporting themselves with clay. We perceived no one sufficiently mature to acquire from Us the truths which God hath taught Us, nor ripe for Our wondrous words of wisdom. Our inner eye wept sore over them, and over their transgressions and their total disregard of the thing for which they were created.

	(Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 200)
