Theirs is a broad manual of virtues - in particular, what those
are. They classify virtues into 6 types:

1. Wisdom and Knowledge (cognitive strenghts)
2. Courage (emotional strength)
3. Humanity (interpersonal strength)
4. Justice (civic strengths)
5. Temperance (self control)
6. Transcendence (finding meaning)

This is an interesting classification, if only for pragmattic reasons;
by classifying these sorts of virtues, it is easy to talk about types
of virtues. Some virtues are so related as to be almost inseparable
(honesty and trustworthiness, for example). These categories are so
distinct as to make it quite easy to be good in one category and not
the other. For instance, we may know someone with a very quick temper
(#5 above, poor self-control) who is also very wise (#1), or someone
who fights for justice and lets it guide his actions (#4) while being
failing to commit to it during periods of stress or pressure (or lacking
courage, #2). This is also useful because improving behavior in any
one of these categories may involve use of specific skills that are
not suitable for any other category. For instance, psychotherapy can
certainly help with one's humanity (interpersonal skills) and
emotional strength (courage), but is less likely to help with one's
sense of justice.

So what are the specific virtues according to this classification?
They are, as follows:

WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE
    creativity (both originality and ingenuity)
    curiosity
    open-mindedness (includes critical thinking)
    love of learning (incluedes mastering skills, may include
    excellence?)
    perspective (wisdom)

COURAGE
    Bravery/Valor (e.g. what we usually think of as courage)
    Persistence (also, industriousness)
    Integrity (includes honesty)
    Vitality (zest, enthusiasm, vigor)

HUMANITY
    Love
    Kindness (includs generosity, nuruing, care, compassion)
    "Social intelligence" (awareness of other people, tact, courtesy)

JUSTICE
    Citizenship (includes loyalty, teamwork)
    Fairness (treating everyone the same)
    "Leadership" (includes encouragement, unity to some extent)

TEMPERANCE
    Forgiveness, mercy
    Humility, modesty
    Prudence
    Self-regulation (include discipline, control of appetites)

TRANSCENDENCE
    Appreciation of beauty, excellence (includes awe, reverence)
    Gratitude (thankfulness)
    Hope (optimism, "future-orientation")
    Humor (playfulness, joy)
    Spirituality (faith, purposefulness, "meaning of life")

As shown above, there are 6 broad categories and 24 more specific
categories. This does not precisely line up with the virtues
curriculum.

If I look at the quotes, it DOES line up with the quotes a fair
bit. Some of this is a fuzzy fit (leadership); others are more
indirect but cerrtainly there; for example, advice on teaching has a lot to do
with "social intelligence.

One that is missing - not sure why that is - is Cleanliness
This is what one might think of as a "hygiene" virtue - something
basically part of humanity. I would very much like to put it in,
although this has a _lot_ to do with social intelligence too. One
that may not fit in is "valor"; the authors of the handbook have
greatly broadened the Athenian virtue of courage to comprise various
aspects of integrity and standing up for one's beliefs. Yet, the
frequent invoking of the martyrs would seem to argue for its inclusion
in Baha'i beliefs.

The handbook's writers theorize the common appearance of these "big
six" virtues is due to it's evolutionary nature. If that is the case,
then it is doubtless true that they will continue to be valuable.

Are their new virtues? Here's some that turn up in the writings that
didn't turn up in their hierarchy.

ASSOCIATION WITH THOSE OF GOOD CHARACTER
CHASTITY (is kinda sorta modesty, but kinda sorta not)
CONTENTMENT
DETACHMENT
AVOIDANCE OF DISPUTATION
DUTY
FEAR OF GOD
FRIENDSHIP
HAPPINESS
IDEALISM
LOGIC
OBEDIENCE
PEACEFULNESS
UNITY

A lot of these really belong elsewhere. So it's very possible that
what has changed is not the core virtue itself, but the way we
interpret these in this day in age.
