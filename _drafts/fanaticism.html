title: Not Tribalism, Not Populism. Fanaticism.
---
    The source of all these catastrophes is racial fanaticism,
    patriotic fanaticism, religious fanaticism and political
    fanaticism. The source of these fanaticisms is ancient imitations,
    religious imitations, racial imitations, patriotic imitations, and
    political imitations. As long as following such imitations
    persists, the very foundation of humanity is wrecked and the world
    of man is in great jeopardy.

	(Provisional Translation, Letter from Abdu'l-Baha to Martha Root)

It can be easy to overlook something when it takes a form you do not
expect. Such is the case with religious fanaticism, or fanaticism in
general. It is easy to miss when it doesn't take the form you expect.

What does a religious fanatic look like? You're probably thinking of
the people who flew the airplanes into twin towers. Terrorists of
various stripes. Loud street preachers, probably with mental problems,
haranguing people on the subways. Members of new religious movements
agressively recuriting people on street corners. The loopy-loo guy in
your old student co-op full of batty theories about quantum theory and
spirits. Political fanatics? The odd leftists that your daughter hangs
out with in college, her friends who believe in reparations for
African-Americans, maybe communists - if those still exist. On the
other hand, you probably can't think of anyone you know and hang out
with, not even among your "facebook friends," can you?

Some of this is just a form of *othering*. I'd be willing to bet that
when you think of fanatics, you think of believers in other religions,
or political movements far removed from anything you learned about in
civics. If you grew up Catholic for instance, your rigid Catholic aunt
who keeps inisisting your baby needs to be baptized, or your second
cousin who moved deep into the country to avoid the pagen cities,
well, or your great-uncle who thinks the problem with this country is
too many of "those people" being allowed to vote... that's just them
being *them*. But you'd never think of them as being fanatics.

To some extent, this is probably healthy. It isn't up to us to judge
anyone; we have no business evaluating the spiritual health of
others. Probably for the best if we look at everyone with a
sin-covering eye, since no one knows if one's motives are truly pure
or not.

And of course the opposite problem, claiming everyone you disagree
with is an unthinking fanatic, is far worse. Consider the case of any
strident atheists you might know of, whose definition of a fanatic is
rather... expansive. As in, "anyone who believes any of that
superstitious nonsense is a fanatic" and "anyone who rears a child
with religious beliefs is guilty of child abuse." I'll leave such
people to air their case out elsewhere, with the knowledge that I'm
nothing but another relgious fanatic to them.

As a result, it makes fanaticism hard to see when it really
does become a pervasive problem - even worldwide. And that seems to be
the point the world is at.

--------------------------------

As a Baha'i, we are repeatedly reminded of the dangers of fanaticism,
and particularly religious fanaticism:

    Religious fanaticism and hatred are a world-devouring fire, whose
    violence none can quench.

	(Baha'u'llah, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 14)

    In matters of religion every form of fanaticism, hatred,
    dissension and strife is strictly forbidden.

	(Baha'u'llah, Tabernacle of Unity)

    A new religious principle is that prejudice and fanaticism whether
    sectarian, denominational, patriotic or political are destructive
    to the foundation of human solidarity; therefore man should
    release himself from such bonds in order that the oneness of the
    world of humanity may become manifest.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Baha'i World Faith - Abdu'l-Baha Section, p. 247)

    Schools must first train the children in the principles of
    religion... but this in such a measure
    that it may not injure the children by resulting in ignorant
    fanaticism and bigotry.

	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 68)

Baha'i writings frequently decry fanaticism, and the early clerical
opponents of the Baha'i Faith are frequently labeled as fanatics; so
much so, that one of a skeptical mindset is tempted to think the
reason Baha'is described their clerical opponents as fanatical is
*because* they were opponents of the Baha'i Faith. That is not the
case. There were a *lot* of opponents of the Baha'i Faith during its
development, and only certain opponents were described as
fanatical. In this case, the opponents of the Baha'i Faith who held
power in the clergy *were* fanatical by any fair description;
obscurantist, anti-science, superstitious and anti-Western (that is,
in opposition to European enlightenment philosophies, which the noble
class in Persia were well aware of). To be a clergy was no
disqualification from following the Baha'i Faith; indeed, many of the
first followers of the Babi and Baha'i Faiths were themselves
clergymen or serious students of Islam.

The condemnation of fanaticism is not purely in the past tense either;
contemporary Baha'i authorities contine to draw attention to it as a
problem. Its urgency is only somewhat dimmed by its overtly
backwards-looking nature:

    The resurgence of fanatical religious fervour occurring in many
    lands cannot be regarded as more than a dying convulsion. The very
    nature of the violent and disruptive phenomena associated with it
    testifies to the spiritual bankruptcy it represents. Indeed, one
    of the strangest and saddest features of the current outbreak of
    religious fanaticism is the extent to which, in each case, it is
    undermining not only the spiritual values which are conducive to
    the unity of mankind but also those unique moral victories won by
    the particular religion it purports to serve.

	(The Universal House of Justice, Messages 1963 to 1986, p. 685)

The main harm it does is to religion itself, unfortunately:

    Tragically, organized religion, whose very reason for being
    entails service to the cause of brotherhood and peace, behaves all
    too frequently as one of the most formidable obstacles in the
    path; to cite a particular painful fact, it has long lent its
    credibility to fanaticism. We feel a responsibility, as the
    governing council of one of the world religions, to urge earnest
    consideration of the challenge this poses for religious
    leadership.

	(The Universal House of Justice, 2002 April, To the World's
	Religious Leaders, p. 1)

So is fanaticism limited to just terrorists and the oddball relative
whose guns we occasionally have to hide? If it were, it seems unlikely
that it would get this amount of attention by the writings. Perhaps
the writings themselves give a clue to exactly what is meant when
fanaticism is referred to. When we search the Baha'i writings, what
words come up in associated with fanaticism?

* bigotry
* hatred
* strife
* ignorant and blind
* unreasoning
* foolish and mindless
* prejudice

Elsewhere in the writings, fanaticism is associated with superstition
and an overall unscientific attitude. All of the above paints a very
specific picture of a fanatic - namely, the sorts of intolerant,
authoritarian loeaders and followers one usually find in extreme
religious causes, cultural movements, and movements of "ethnic
purity". As much as you may dislike the benighted followers of
flat-earth movements and anti-vaxxers, these do not fall into this
category of fanaticism. Instead, one is more likely to find this in
the more extreme wings of well-accepted cultural movements. By its
very nature, when it hides inside accepted institutions, it is hard to
see it as a problem; those who do see it as a problem tend to blame
the movement itself, rather than the fanaticism which damages the
movement.

--------------------------

The question is what to do about it.

I suspect modern psychologists would explain fanaticism as an
unhelathy coping mechanism for something called "cognitive
dissonance." Cognitive dissonance is the discomfort you feel when you
have to reconcile two beliefs that are in seeming opposition to one
another. You, gentle reader, being a psychologically healthy
individual, you would react to congnitive
dissonance by re-examining the conflicting beliefs; perhaps you may
discard one belief, judging it to be erroneous, but more likely you'll
modify both so that they come in agreement with one another. Thinking
religious people do it all the time, but this isn't a religous
process. Scients do it as well; they frequently have their own favorite pet
theories, but the best of them are quick to modify or discard theories
when presented with enough evidence to the contrary. (Of course, that
doesn't always happen; hence the saying "Science progresses one
funeral at a time.")

In someone who is not psychologically healthy, cognitive dissonance is
instead resolved by seeking to eliminate the _source_ of this
dissonance; a nonbelieving relative, scientific authorities, members
of different cultures, unflattering media. Anything that does not
conform to their own cherished beliefs are rejected, ensuring that
cognitive dissonance is never experienced.

But that doesn't fully explain the sort of fanaticism condemned in the
Baha'i writings. Someone could be excessive fearful and credulous by
their very nature. Is fanaticism really blameworthy for such people?
The answer is, it depends upon what one does with one's fanatical
world view. The fanatical behaviors described in the Baha'i are those
that insist on controlling one's environment, those close to them,
even to the society as a whole.

    The fact that we imagine ourselves to be right and everybody else
    wrong is the greatest of all obstacles in the path towards unity,

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Paris Talks, p. 135)

    Fighting, and the employment of force, even for the right cause,
    will not bring about good results.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Abdu'l-Baha in London, p. 91)

    The unbelievers and the faithless have set their minds on four
    things: first, the shedding of blood; second, the burning of
    books; third, the shunning of the followers of other religions;
    fourth, the extermination of other communities and groups.

	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 91)

The fanatics causing suffering don't just have inflexible
beliefs. They have an unhealthy amount of pride. And of the seven
deadly sins described in medieval works, pride is acknowledged as the
deadliest; the sin that so diseased Satan, the angel, that he was cast
into the underworld as the Lord of Darkness. (By the way, the source
of this isn't actually medieval works - it's actually the Koran! One
of these days I'll write a blog post about how the European
Rennaisance was nothing but an outgrowth of Islamic intellectual
movements that came hundreds of years before...)

So how to treat this problem? Baha'u'llah's first order of business
what to ensure that _his own believers did not themselves become
fanatics_. While many of his early writings invoke martyrdom as a
token of sacrifice - in keeping with its background in Shi'i Islam
beliefs - they are meant as figurative and are no excuse for descent
into fanaticism and intolerance. While the writings themselves are
replete with calls for fidelity in the faith and sacrifice, such can
never be forced on anyone but oneself.

    In this Day, We can neither approve the conduct of the fearful
    that seeketh to dissemble his faith, nor sanction the behavior of
    the avowed believer that clamorously asserteth his allegiance to
    this Cause. Both should observe the dictates of wisdom

	(Baha'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 343)

    Some heedless souls roam the lands in the name of God, actively
    engaged in ruining His Cause, and call it promoting and teaching
    the Word of God...

	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 58)

    The Lord of celestial wisdom saith: A harsh word is even as a
    sword thrust; a gentle word as milk. The latter leadeth the
    children of men unto knowledge and conferreth upon them true
    distinction.

	(Baha'u'llah, Tabernacle of Unity)

In fact, there are actual laws from the central figure Baha'u'llah
which forbids behaviors and lifestyles that can cultivate fanaticism:
priesthood, monastacism, ascetism, and forcing one's interpretation of
the Holy Writings on others. He also forbade his believers to enage in
contention and conflict of any sort, let alone about questions of
personal belief.  Likewise, he urged his followers to consort with
followers of all religions, instead of isolating themselves into their
own sub-communities. Other particular laws of note:

* The burning of books is forbidden.
* In sickness, competent physicians shall be consulted with.
* Universal education for all is an obligation for families and
societies, particularly in literacy, conduct and "the
useful arts" (i.e. sciences).
* It upholds the authority of science and "the learned" in matters of
the natural world.

Before closing this topic, I need to clarify that these laws are
written only for the Baha'is themselves. They were not written so that
Baha'is could force this upon other people (much as friends of the
Baha'i Faith may wish they were). It was for Baha'is by the founders,
to insist on proper conduct and attitudes from those that claimed to
follow the Faith.

---------------------

One of the concerns of the intellectual class is recent movements in
the political life of many nations. While Baha'is do not concern
themselves overtly with issues of politics, particular of partisan
politics, we can and do speak out regarding the moral lives and
character of communities. It is no secret that recent political
discourse has taken an extremely negative turn; indeed, much of it
seems directly opposed to Baha'i teachings.

Current relgious movements are 




-----------------

Baha'is do not as a rule, involve themselves in political
matters. While some think this is due to a natural quietism and
pacifism, related to perhaps concern of survival, it is more likely a
question of focus. Questions posed as political matters are generally
instead moral or spiritual in nature, and dealing with them through
polical means tend to push it anywhere.

This morning, I overheard someone at the newsstand playing a radio -
the song on was Prince's "1999." I thought to myself "I bet half the
people at work are too young to know why the year 1999 was such a big
deal when I was a kid.

If you run into someone who is knee deep in to fundamentalism,
conspiracy theories or bad fake news, you probably don't think of them
as fanatics. 

Much of the failures of current democracies have been placed at the
hands of demagogues or "populists" or "tribalism" or various other
right-wing movements. This misses what may very well be a primary
motivation for this - the increasing fanaticism of various movements
that feel they are losing time and sliding into irrelevance.
