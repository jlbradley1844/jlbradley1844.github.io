# How to Baha'i (for seculars and skeptics)

I try to write this blog for others - whoever may stumble across
it. But I have to write about what I know, which narrows things
down quite a bit. In particular, I'm interested in philosophy and
religion. That rules out a bunch of people.

I'm not writing this for me though. I'm writing this for you.
Who are you? Well, given that you're reading long-form blog posts...

There is a particular type of
personality which is, I would say... well, not un-spiritual, but
certainly not spiritual in the sense of "in tune with the universe" and
"seeking the eternal one" and "following God in all its forms"
and _Woooooooooo_. They certainly don't enjoy sitting around with
their thoughts and deeply meditating and roaming the astral plains.
They don't pray to something they regard as a Babylonian Sky God and
bristle at the notion at the mention of worship of any entity.
Instead, they view religion and spirituality on entirely pragmatic
terms. Where religion and spirituality work, it's very selectively.
And generally it's personal - for them only.

If this clicks for you, then you're who I want to talk to. You don't
necessarily think of yourself as atheistic, but too much of
religion is alienating, and spirituality is often too new-agey and
smelling of humbug to speak to you. But you might be interested in things
done by religious people - meditation, yoga, retreats, etc.
And you're definitely interested in becoming a better person,
improving every year in your outlook, balance, and ability to
serve others in humanity.

If you then have any use for religion it's self-development. Or more
to the point, if you have to listen to a spiritual leader, your
attitude is:

    Shut up and tell me what to do

You probably aren't waiting for people to give you orders - and
wouldn't like it if they did! - but you'd appreciate a path that
will make you feel better and be a
better person for others - one that will help you have better
relationships. And you aren't going to be forced on any "spirit
quests" to discover your "inner light." You figure it ought to be
simpler than that, and shouldn't require a guru.

Are you like that? I know I am.

One of the ironies is that for all the talk of each generation being
less religious than the one before it, is that there is still
plenty of
interest in the
"deeper" self-help philosophies, if you will. Think about the interest
in Bhuddist thought and the followings in some areas of the
Stoic philosophy. Such philosophies don't require you to buy into
a notion of spirit realms you can't see. What they do, instead, is
to tell you what to do in order to be a "better person." That's
in quotes because the definition of that is usually up for grabs.

I'm convinced that this skeptical outlook is reflective of a distinct 
"religious personality," and such people can
benefit from study of the Baha'i Faith _without_ buying into the
theological beliefs underpinning it. Personally I am a Baha'i, but to confess,
I frequently relate better to the skeptical sort than those who immerse
themselves entirely in the belief system, noble as it is. 
People practice meditation, yoga,
journaling and a host of other "spiritual" practices to better themselves,
all the while professing absolute disinterest in anything spiritual. If
you want to call yourself a Bhuddist, by all means learn and practice it
in its fullness, but _anyone_ can befit from that practice, Bhuddist
or not. I'm betting that if you _practice_ the Baha'i Faith, you can benefit
from it and eventually recognize some deeper truths, without forcing
yourself at any time to bury reasonable doubts about any religious path.
If I have an ulteriour motive in writing this, it's only because I hope
that some of you, upon practicing, may one day be moved to associate
yourself with the Baha'i community on a deeper level.

In my opinion, the founder of the Baha'i Faith, Baha'u'llah recognized
people like you in one of his
own writings. In a writing called 
_The Four Valleys_, he talked about four types of "spiritual wayfarers" if
you will:

>   If the wayfarers be among them that seek after **the sanctuary of the 
>   Desired One**, this plane pertaineth to the self—but the self which 
>   is intended is “the Self of God that pervadeth all His laws”. 
>   In this station the self is not rejected but beloved; it 
>   is regarded with favour and is not to be shunned. 

This passage is going to be very obscure to almost all of you. Baha'u'llah 
wrote this for a very particular sort of religiously-minded readers
(in this case, the Sufi mystics of the nineteenth century)
but most Baha'i scholars have interpreted this as
referring to those who find God through their own dedication to self-mastery
and virtuous conduct and adherance to a code of conduct. Again, "just tell me
what to do." 
So for those of you who care not a whit about spirituality, I'll tell
you what I know. How to "Do Baha'i" without actually being Baha'i. Happy
Baha'ing!

## Peacefulness

This is not the most important thing, but since this is what Baha'is seem
to known uniquely for, I'll start here.

### Physical Nonviolence

Baha'is are not pacifist (1), but are known as peace-loving. Indeed, one
of the first laws religious Baha'u'llah declared after his mission was the forbidding
of any religious warfare. As said by the Universal House of Justice, the supreme
deliberative bond of the Baha'is: "Bahá'u'lláh has stated that is 
preferable to be killed in the path of God's good-pleasure than to 
kill, and that organized religious attack against Bahá'ís should never turn 
into any kind of warfare." (From a 1968 letter.) Physical altercation by Baha'is is
forbidden, and
there is also a general culture of nonviolence. Hunting among Baha'is is infrequent
(though not forbidden), and it is not usual to find Baha'i families that won't buy
toy guns for their kids, shield them from violent media and sanction them for
getting into unnecessary fights.

There are also a few distinctive religious laws that put them at the
fringe of certain parts of American culture:

* Lethal arms may not be kept in the house, except in conditions of social
  unrest (America hasn't been in this state since Civil War, regardless of
  what your cousin in the militia tells you.)

* Baha'i youth are advised to register as conscienscious objectors for
  draft registration, to allow them to be placed in non-combat positions
  should their draft be necessary.

If that were it, though, that would make our outlook unusual, it wouldn't
be unique. Plenty of believers
of all Faiths believe in physical nonviolence at its core. Indeed, Baha'i views
are moderate compared to some creeds. Self-defense is permitted, as is the use
of physical force to prevent injustice.

If you're looking for a life-changing code, "staying out of fights" would
certainly change the lives of some people. But I'm going to guess that
you've probably figured that out on your own. Unless you're unwisely putting
yourself in situations where violence is expected, it isn't too hard to
refrain from violence.

However, Baha'i practice focuses not on simply absention from physical violence,
but abstention on violence in any of its forms. Indeed, Baha'i practice
requires one to abstain from a number of verbally violent behaviors.

### Verbal Nonviolence

People generally are brought up to only watch out for one particularly
troublesome form of speech: calumny. Everyone is taught not to lie, but in
reality calumny is what is really sanctioned in society - lying about someone's
misdeeds to discredit someone, protect oneself or protect another. Outside of 
that, many societies consider
various sorts of "fibbing" as to be fair game. Even the Baha'i writings give
indications of times where direct truth is not the wisest course of action.
But calumny is uniformly condemned as wrong.

However, one lesson of the Baha'i writings is to become much more careful
with your speech. In effect, refrain from verbal violence as you would physical
violence. There are things that can be just as damaging as calumny in
certain respects.

Probably the most serious misuses of language in society is backbiting - the
habit of speaking ill of others who are not present. 

> O Son of Being! How couldst thou forget thine own faults and busy 
> thyself with the faults of others? Whoso doeth this is accursed of Me.

> O Son of Man! Breathe not the sins of others so long as thou art
> thyself a sinner. Shouldst thou transgress this command, accursed
> wouldst thou be, and to this I bear witness."
                       -- Baha'u'llah, _The Hidden Words_

> ...backbiting quencheth the light of the heart, and extinguisheth 
   the life of the soul.
                       -- Baha'u'llah, _The Book of Certitude_

Backbiting - discussing the faults of others not present - is a nasty habit.
And it's easy to fall into. Like the air we breathe, it's so pervasive
that it escapes notice. People think of backbiting as being nasty to a friend
behind their back, but that's simply one example. Think of half of the
commentary on social media; ridicule and scorn are commonly heaped on
all sorts of people in society. Other ethnicities, religions, political movements,
people residing in other locations, entire populations are regularly
abused without regard to one's firsthand knowledge of the situation.
Your entire Facebook feed may consist mostly of backbiting - "viral posts"
shared among like-minded people trashing others who will never see that
slander because it won't show up in the feed. Indeed, the ads in your
feed may very well fit in with the same sorts of slanders.

There are situations where there really is a need to report on the
ill behavior of others. Backbiting isn't that. Most people can instinctively
tell the difference. The old advice is the best: if you can't say anything nice, 
don't say anything at all.

"It isn't backbiting if it's the truth" is the common riposte when one
wants to justify backbiting. Perhaps _you_ think it's the truth. But
are you backbiting because it needs to be said? Or are you just attacking
a person or a group of people you don't like? Or worse yet, are you trying
to bond with someone else over shared resentments, regardless of who else's
reputation you are trying to trash?

If you're serious about self-improvement, then the
person you focus on improving should be... yourself. Concerning ourselves
with the faults of others takes your focus off of that. If someone is causing
you problems, then a painful communication may be necessary, but that's
still under your initiative. If, however, you simply dislike something
about a person and wish to vent about it, it's better to let those feelings go.

Other less abusive forms of verbal violence are also to be avoided:

>   For the tongue is a smoldering fire, and excess of speech a deadly poison. 
>   Material fire consumeth the body, whereas the fire of the tongue devoureth 
>   both heart and soul. The force of the former lasteth but for a time, 
>   whilst the effects of the latter endureth a century.

>   Be fair in thy judgment, and guarded in thy speech.

>   Henceforward everyone should utter that which is meet and seemly, and should 
>   refrain from slander, abuse and whatever causeth sadness in men.

>   One word may be likened unto fire, another unto light, and the influence 
>   which both exert is manifest in the world. Therefore an enlightened man of 
>   wisdom should primarily speak with words as mild as milk...


Less problematic, but still an issue, is the coarse nature of much 
casual communication nowadays.
One may avoid ridicule and derision, yet still communicate in a harsh manner.
Think of why you're speaking. It shouldn't be for simply venting. The Baha'i
path urges moderation in all things, including tone of speech.

There is still a place for criticism. One may
say negative things about the faults of others when that person is present.
But it must be done in the right tone, particularly if you are the person
in authority. Do your words convey patience and forbearance, or impatience
and anger? Your words and attitude must convey that you're presenting 
yourself as someone who
sees a fault in someone and is hopeful that the recepient is a good person
wo will change its ways. In the case of the latter, the recipient will not
hear the criticism, but instead react to its emotional content. "This person
is angry with me." This can provoke a number of reactions, none of which
address what you'd like to do - address a fault.

If you need to modify someone's behavior, and it is unsafe or unwise to
confront him or directly, and the person you are talking to is in a position
to do something about it, the best thing to do is act like you're 
giving a police report. State
the actions and what you saw - nothing but the facts. You can give the
unvarnished truth without using loaded language. Tell only the objective
truth. Not only does this avoid edging into backbiting, it makes you more
credible to the listener and allows you emotionally detach from the situation.

### Media and Social Networking

If you don't want to use negative speech, I imagine you don't want
to be hearing it either. If you want to avoid using it, you can avoid picking
it up:

>   Ignoring gossip and slander is a positive, constructive and healing action 
>   helpful to the community, the gossiper and to the persons slandered.

>   The pages of swiftly-appearing newspapers are indeed the mirror of the world. 
>   They reflect the deeds and the pursuits of divers peoples and kindreds. 
>   They both reflect them and make them known...
>   However, it behoveth the writers thereof to be purged from the promptings of 
>   evil passions and desires and to be attired with the raiment of justice and 
>   equity. They should enquire into situations as much as possible and ascertain 
>   the facts, then set them down in writing.

>   Do not listen to anything that is prejudiced, for self-interest prompts 
>   men to be prejudiced. They are thoughtful only of their own will and purposes. 
>   They live and move in darkness.
>               (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 41)

Much of the media we consume hardly counts as objective reporting. Instead,
it poses as news but is really "infotainment"; opinion disguised as news 
which seeks to engage
its listeners with a stream of self-regarding mistruths, gossip about disliked
people and cultures, outright backbiting and selectively edited stories calculated
to outrage. As simply a listener, we aren't going to "fix" this problem. The
best we can do is recognize when we are being similarly targeted and refuse
to listen.

The goal is to eliminate the negative, disparaging, trash-talking content
of what poses as much of modern discourse. Don't bring that negativity into
your life. If you want to keep the peace, use peaceful language.

If everyone refrained from physical and verbal violence, everyone would
agree the world would be much better - without as many misunderstandings,
arguments, and stressful situations. But there's a problem: only your own
actions are under your control.

That being the case, you may wonder: what's the point of cleaning up my
behvior? How will my acting properly make others acting properly?

The answer: you have to control things under your control. And at the
very least, you won't hurt yourself by doing this. You will instead be
much happier.

## Unity and Community-Building

>  Illumine and hallow your hearts; let them not be profaned by the 
>  thorns of hate or the thistles of malice.
>         (Baha'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 333)

Competition has its place in society. But there is a strong case to be
made that in many Western societies, excessive competitiveness and
combativeness has become a problem. This applies both to individuals
and society as a whole.

>  In the eyes of those possessed of insight, all this conflict, contention and 
>  vainglory hath ever been, and will ever be, like unto the play and pastimes of children.
>        (Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 169)

>  A world in which naught can be perceived save strife, quarrels and corruption 
>  is bound to become the seat of the throne, the very metropolis, of Satan.
>        (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 176)

People also know that cooperation is the foundation of a civil society.
But they get this message less and less. Instead, we live in a commercial and
media environment steeped in combativeness. At work, we see environments
where raises and promotions are limited not by merit, but are scarce by
design and limited to top performers. Who is a top performer? Why, those
who out-compete the others. If you ignore these messages at work, then
you get it from the media, which seems purposely designed to create
paranoia. From story arcs that always have a villian, to partisan news
sources that create villians out of one's neighbors, to product advertisements
aimed at making people feel small and insecure if you aren't "winning," the
fight never ends. Even in self improvement - self help books, personal
coaches, even therapists are there to help you 'fight' for what you need.
Even some religious denominations try to leverage this to influency you! Many
religious "teachers" are more than happy to tell you that
your belief, feality and obedience are all duties you must assume in a
neverending War of Good and Evil against "them" (where "them," for some reason,
are people you were disinclined to like anyway. Funny, that.)

You've probably noticed - for a lot of these people, it's in _their_ self-interest
for _you_ to keep up the fight.

### Avoiding Unnecessary Conflict

Now, let's look at how the ill effects of combativeness are combated in society.
A lot of the interest around mindfulness and yoga and self-acceptance
and all that whatnot is about reducing the ego threats you feel in
society. By guiding you into stepping back.
If you're unhappy and stressed out all the time, the implication is 
that the problem is something internal to you; we can somehow tame our reactions
to a neverending stream of threats.

But that is a bit like telling us to all wear filter masks so that others
may pollute freely.
The problem is not that you are reacting to these messages badly. The problem
is you are reacting to those messages _as if they are true_. If they really
were true, you would have every reason to be stressed out and unhappy all
the time. There's a reason all these teen dystopias seem to be about children
growing up in conflict and war with each other: because it's an absolutely
miserable way to live. It seems you don't really have dystopia without needless conflict.

The solution to turning this around is to recognize that almost all of
the conflicts people try to draw you into are _absolutely fake_(2). You are not 
surrounded by enemies. There are not people out
to hate you and hurt you. Your co-workers are not out to stab you in
the back. Crime is not out of control. You do not need to get your kid into
Harvard to guarantee a future for him or her. You are not a failure if you
fail to make your first million. Need I go on?

If you take one thing away from this article it's this: life is not a game
to be played as if there are winners and losers.

If you stop seeing everything as a conflict, you will stop swimming around in
stress hormones. It is important to train yourself to not
see conflict where it doesn't exist. And not to create enemies where there are
none.

>  Do not see any enemies. Though he be your murderer, see no enemy. Look 
>  upon him with the eye of friendship. Be mindful that you do not consider 
>  him as an enemy and simply tolerate him, for that is but stratagem and 
>  hypocrisy. To consider a man your enemy and love him is hypocrisy. This 
>  is not becoming of any soul. You must behold him as a friend. You must 
>  treat him well. This is right.
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace)

Now, you will run into people in your life that seem to think everything is
a competition. Occasionally this is just insecurity and narcissism - someone 
who needs to feel like "a winner" just to belong. However, that will account
probably for most of the overly-competitive you run across; as disagreeable
as you may find these people, it's probably a fault you need to tolerate. Those
people aren't trying to ruin others; they are just a little disagreeable and 
insecure.

Far more dangerous are the tiny handful who seem to thrive not just upon 
winning, but upon _defeating_
others. If you need to deal with such people, you need to adopt very pragmatic
strategies. And if you are in a position of power or influence, you may have to take actions
to protect others against them. But your behavior must be consistent. When you do
deal with these people, you must still deal with them fairly. And you must not
believe such people are beyond help. The inclination is
to "punish" such people whenever you can, but that just gives them a fight, something
they already thrive on and you probably don't.
If the worst happens and reasonable efforts fail, you may just simply
have to avoid such people.

### Consultation

As indicated above, conflict is usually not a conflict when taken in the right
perspective. But you will have... how do we say... _differences_ with others. Lots
of them.

How these differences are handled matter a great deal to society. There are
right ways, and others, less right:

>  In France I was present at a session of the senate, but the experience 
>  was not impressive. Parliamentary procedure should have for its object 
>  the attainment of the light of truth upon questions presented and not 
>  furnish a battleground for opposition and self-opinion. Antagonism and 
>  contradiction are unfortunate and always destructive to truth. In the 
>  parliamentary meeting mentioned, altercation and useless quibbling were 
>  frequent; the result, mostly confusion and turmoil; even in one instance 
>  a physical encounter took place between two members. It was not consultation 
>  but comedy.
>                (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 72)


The Baha'i teachings around peacefulness would be very remiss if it did not
say what to do _instead_ of conflict. Fortunately, it does. Which leads to a
few more distinctive Baha'i practices.

The most distinctive is a group decision-making process known as _consultation_.
Unlike a lot of other Baha'i practices, this process evolved through the early
growth of the faith, under the guidance of the central figures of the faith.

>  Take ye counsel together in all matters, inasmuch as consultation is the lamp 
>  of guidance which leadeth the way, and is the bestower of understanding.
>                (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 168)

There is no canonical how-to on consultation; there is no "Robert's Rules of Order"
to attend to. Instead, consultation works on the following principals:

1. This being a group decision-making process that involves all participants,
the group must be small enough to allow participation by all. In my opinion, 
more than a dozen people
starts to become unworkable. In Baha'i deliberative bodies, 9 is the usual number. (3)
While we do this because of the Baha'i writings, this idea has come up in business
as well, with the concept of a "two pizza team," the idea being that if you can't
feed the team with two pizzas, it's too big to keep everyone on the same page.

2. All participants must respect one another and committ themselves to the
common goal of finding a truthful outcome Partisanship has no place in 
consultations, and those consulting must set
aside all personal feelings of loyalty to tribe and group membership or association.
Baha'is are told that participants must feel absolute love and fellowship for
one another. While this may not be possible for your group, it is doubtful consultation
will produce an outcome everyone will hold to if members of the group cannot trust
and respect one another.

3. The goal of consultation is the unfettered search for truth. Statements must be 
made in a
dispassionate way and refer to the facts at hand. Opinions and strong emotional
statements obscure the truth, intentionally or not. The strenght of one's personal
feelings may be conveyed, but may not have bearing on the rightness or wrongness
of any idea.

>  He who expresses an opinion should not voice it as correct and right but set 
>  it forth as a contribution to the consensus of opinion,
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 72)

>  Man should weigh his opinions with the utmost serenity, calmness and composure.
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 72)

4. Speakers should use tact, wisdom, and speak in moderation. However, this
does not imply self-censorship. All ideas must be offered. Good intentions must
be presumed of all partiipants, and one should not take offense when none is
intended.

5. All ideas are the property of the group. Once uttered, it does not make sense
to refer to something as belonging to a particular person. If ratified, it is the
group as a whole that promotes the idea.

6. Minutes may be necessary for transparency - particular if the group is making
decisions for a larger group. However, specifics of the details recorded are for the group
as a whole to decide. When it comes to individual votes, anonymity must be preserved
in the case of a majority vote.
Points may be taken down without reference to speakers or supporters of various
position, as members must be able to speak freely. In many cases, confidentiality is
necessy for personal safety; it may even be necessary to either record
these separately so as to keep such notes in confidence.

>  Indeed, it has ever been the cherished desire of our Master, 'Abdu'l-Bahá, that 
>  the friends in their councils, local as well as national, should by their 
>  candor, their honesty of purpose, their singleness of mind, and the thoroughness 
>  of their discussions, achieve unanimity in all things.
>             (Shoghi Effendi, Baha'i Administration, p. 80)


7. A strong effort is made to come to a consensus, All members must agree on the
proposal for it to move forward. Unfortunately, a deadlock may occur. If there
are several attempts to break a deadlock and they fail, a majority vote may be
necessary to produce a final decision.
This prevents a small number of individuals who support the status quo from
blocking all change.

8. Once a decision is made, it must be supported by all members, whether or not
they agreed with the proposal. This avoids "sandbagging" by members who are unhappy
with a decision. As part of this, one may not indicate that they did not originally
support the idea; one's personal views do not matter. One is speaking for the
whole once a matter is decided.

The goal of this is to ensure that the group is in unity around a particular
plan of action. The goal is NOT to reach a final decision, now and for the end
of time. By taking a unified action and watching results, it will the be much
easier to determine whether or not the right action was decided upon. In this
matter, even large mistakes by the group may be quickly corrected.

### Non-Partisanship and Political Non-Alignment

One may look at the requirements for consultation and admire this as a
decision-making process for business and government. For government especially
comes the question: what then of the place for political parties of common 
interest? Cannot they organize to best represent their interest? Should they
not organize to defend views they consider right?

The Baha'i answer to this is clear: they can not and should not.

The reason is evident as is spelled out in the purpose of decision making.
The purpose is to serve _the group as a whole_. Now: if there was any political
party that represented both party members and non-party members, I haven't
heard of such an entity. The purpose of a political party is PARTisan; it
represents a PART of a whole, not the whole.

Since you, gentle reader, are probably not a Baha'i, you have no obligation
to change your behavior. However, the law for Baha'is (my understanding) 
is thus:

    One cannot belong to a political party. One cannot identify with a
    political party. One cannot even publicly take sides in
    political controversies of a partisan nature.

This may seem somewhat extreme. Most people registered to a political party
do so only for the convenience of voting in a primary. In states like New York,
party affiliation is _required_ to vote in a primary. Nevertheless, for Baha'is the only
way to avoid partisanship is to avoid aligning oneself with a party. Entirely.

This is particularly the case in today's environment. Perhaps sometime
in the mythic bipartisan past, there was broad agreement across the parties
on All Things American, the parties respected the members of one another,
and all worked toward a common solution. I doubt it. And in any case, this
"bipartisanship" mostly worked by entirely avoid the issue of civil rights
(more on that later).

But now, the major factor of partisan affiliation is "negative partisanship";
that is, one affiliates with a party as a show of hatred for members of the
other party. In such a case, it is even more important to avoid such partisanship.

Aside from this, the Baha'i writings say little. I will, however, add two
very compelling problems that result when you engage in partisan conduct.

_Emotional Imblance_: Most people who engage in partisan politics _feel_
extremely strongly about something. And unfortunate as it is, many times
these feelings aren't based on something imaginary. There really are problems
that could be solved easily, were there not intransigent opposition by
a significant minority of the population.

Unfortunately for you, you do not know with any certainty that problems you
are hung up on are _actually problems_. And in any event, such things are
not under your control. If you are driven by such frustrations as to long
for gas chambers of your opponents, you are no longer in a position where
you are thinking clearly.
Inevitably, such contempt for others leaks out into words and action, resulting
in backbiting and acts of minor agression. Slowly, one becomes a less
social person and unhappy. In the worst case, one becomes antisocial and
posts unbalanced rants from the computer in the basement.

Does that sound like a prescription for happiness? Not on your life.

_Political Hobbyism_: Another problem I have to credit to a writer (TODO)
that puts his finger on a real problem. People confuse "being informed"
or "being concerned" or "arguing with strangers on the internet" as being
politically active.

Certainly, when one does that, one is engaging in partisan behavior. But
is it really political?

If someone is "engaged" in this manner, then the only course of action one
has is _voting_. Note that this is the same course of action available to
someone who is blissfuly ignorant of the events of the day, wanders
into the voting booth, and chooses his or her candidate based on who looked more
"leadership-py" in their campaign ads.

This engagement is not political activism. It is political hobbyism. Actually
being political requires working with others to improve how government works
for them. Being involved in town meetings, running for nonpartisan offices,
being engaged in organizations for social change (and I don't mean just cutting
a check). If you don't have the time to do that, then you probably could make
your life a lot better by cutting back your reading in the name of being
"engaged".

Before I was Baha'i I was rather "engaged" myself. The result of all my
activities is probably that I was a less agreeable person to be around. By detaching
myself from these hobbies, I gained a better sense of control of my life,
and the time to read for fun again.

### Small Scale Change

What does that mean? It means all actual effective change is going to come
at the small scale.

To improve any situation, the place to start is _locally_. It feels important to
be engaged in "the big issues." It's also woefully ineffective. You can show up
in the polling both; you can call your representative. That's about it.

If you want to make change locally, that's something you can do something about.
You can organize people at the neighborhood, and solve problems at that level.
The more focused and local, the better. If you wish to effect national change,
the idea is still the same - many people speaking with one voice will gain a
hearing that scattered individuals would not.
Still, it is not sufficient for people to vote for faraway representatives to take
actions to then be imposed top-down on the people voted for. Instead, decisions
must be taken by the very people who are acted upon by those decisions.

Members of the Baha'i Faith are encouraged to "think small" when it comes
to projects of social improvement:

- Survey your local community to see what resources you have at hand, both
human and otherwise.

- Once done, find out what the local needs are and how those resources can
be applied.

- Start small pilot projects, eventually forming an organization of social
or economic change.

Key to this, as you might guess, is consultation, using the process mentioned
earlier.

## Psychic Improvement - Prayer and Meditation

OK, so earlier I promised you there would be no spiritual wooooooo, no prayers
to some nature God/Goddes or focusing on your chakras. None of that devotional
nonsense or boring prayer for you, right?

But on the other hand, I have to tell you how to apply Baha'i teachings to
your life, right?

So I can't skip over this. In the Baha'i Faith, prayer and meditation is
_important_. Some Baha'is would say this is indeed _the_ most important,
and would regard everything else I'm writing about as extraneous.

I'm on the other end of the spectrum. If given a choice between silent
contemplation and an action that would make a difference, I'd choose an action.
(Although right now, working on a blog post, I suspect I may be doing neither).
But yet, I still pray and meditate, though perhaps to a lesser extent than many
of my fellow believers.

In the Baha'i Faith, "prayer and meditation" is a rather broad concept.
I know Baha'is who still pray in the "low Protestant" sense of the word,
talking to God and asking for things and holding hands with their
neighbor. But many others do different things. For instance, Baha'is have a
tradition of chanting written prayers and writings, similar to the Islamic
tradition. But those of us with less beautiful voices will just read
prayers from the Baha'i writings, silently or aloud, and frequently from
memory. How much is up to individual believers, though there is an
obligatory prayer said once a day in a few different forms.

Why do I do it, when I go around telling people "I don't believe in
magic?" Is it just because I'm supposed to? Isn't prayer just you asking
G*d for stuff? Something less civilized people do instead of funding
laws to prevent bad stuff from happening? In the Baha'i Faith, it is
nothing of the sort.

Here's the short form of the obligatory prayers:

>  I bear witness, O my God, that Thou hast created me to know the
>  and worship Thee. I testify at this moment to my powerlessness and
>  to Thy might, to my poverty and to Thy wealth. There is no other
>  God but Thee, the help in peril, the self-subsisting.

And here's another one, much shorter than usual, which is usually used
in stressful situations instead of repeating, say, "serenity now":

>  Is there any remover of difficulties save God? Say, praise be
>  God! He is God, all are his servants and all abide by his bidding.

Now look at both these prayers. What don't you see? Are you asking God
for something? Talking to him like he's your buddy? Do you think God
even cares if you're saying these or not? In fact, He may not, and
that's _entirely the point_. _You_ are saying these. These are messages
for you. Now, most Baha'is will tell you these prayers have "spiritual
potency" of one form or another, but even if you refuse to believe
in "spirit," you can see the effect if you say these and pay attention.

I can't interpret what these prayers mean or do, but I can tell you
what they mean to me. The obligatory prayer is a strong reminder to
be humble. The second prayer is a reminder that you will encounter
difficulties that are not under your control, and that's life. You can't
say these prayers and mean them without thinking about if your life
is in conformity with these lessons.

Now supposing you don't believe in this G*d stuff. There are many Baha'i
prayers and virtually all of them invoke G*d in some form. I could sit
here and try to explain what Baha'is believe about God - how He himself
is an unknowable essense which we cannot in any way directly communicate
with, how we use the pronoun He becuase of limitations of English grammar
only ('It' would imply nonintelligence, 'They' would imply multiplicity
and polythesim). But I suspect any G*d at allis too much of an ask for
some of you.

In that case, I do think it's important to at the very least, sit still
with your thoughts a few minutes every day, and self-reflect on the
type of person you are regularly. The Baha'i writings have this piece of
advice:

>  O SON OF BEING!
>  Bring thyself to account each day ere thou art summoned to a reckoning; 
>  for death, unheralded, shall come upon thee and thou shalt be called 
>  to give account for thy deeds.
>          (Baha'u'llah, The Arabic Hidden Words #31)

If you want to become a better person (and if you don't, why are you
reading this?), you'll need to take into account the fact you have
only one life, and you'll need to think every day on how to best
make use of it. 

That sounds like a heavy thought, but if you've done journaling or a
daily diary that's a start. Set aside a short time near the end of
the day to sit with your thoughts and review the sort of person
you've been that day. If you can't stand the thought of prayers
or meditating, that's a start.

As far as meditating, there are as many techniques as there are people.
Many Baha'is meditate upon the Baha'i writings, no surprise there, but
there are those that use meditation as a special "quiet time," similar
to Quaker and Buddhist practices. Reading certain sorts of philosophy or
even poetry can serve as a meditation. One can even use a mantra; the Baha'i
writings direct believers to say a certain phrase 95 times each day(4),
which serves as a guided metidation. All of these forms seek the same
thing - to cultivate a "pure" mind for reflection and unclouded thought.
Personally, I bristle at the commercialized version of this, "mindfulness," 
which is promoted as some sort of life hack to eliminate stress. (The
key to getting rid of stress is to eliminate stressors. For some reason,
work HR deparments aren't terribly fond of that one). But returning to
my theme:meditation, like the daily self review, is an important way to
refocus yourself. Most Baha'is would feel life without prayer and
meditation unthinkable.

Note that this is not therapy or "self care." The purpose is not
to reduce stress, whatever the stressors are. The purpose is to
work on yourself. If you cannot stand the thought of conversing with
God, the least you can do is let your psyche converse with yourself.

## Logic

One of the key points in the Baha'i Faith, odd as it seems, is logic.
This may surpise many - even those who are Baha'is. But Baha'is
definitely have a respect for science and logic that sets them apart
from other denominations. This is not to say that individual Baha'is
do not pose their own theories of the worlds of the spirit and vent all
sorts of untestable theories. The difference is Baha'is will always
indicate these are their _own individual thoughts_, and will not expect
the assent of others.

Where they do expect assent is in recognition of logical thought and science.
But doing just that would be unremarkable for any religious
organization. All religions claim their beliefs are eminintly logical, and
of course their believers use logic. And all say they are in conformity
with "science" (though many will insist on defining science in a way that
is compatibile with their beliefs).

Much of the Baha'i writings in and around reasoning are directed toward
audiences which, compared to this readership, are far more religious.
So much of what came in for criticism was existing religious thought,
steeped as it was in "blind imitation" of religious practices and
ancestral forms. But there are other more human tendencies that come under
criticism as illogical.

The fact is, logic is a skill that is often not applied due to certain
failures of thinking. Many of us know about cognitive biases - how people
fall prey to certain misbeliefs because of the way our brain works. However,
more problematic are often failings which are almost moral in nature; a
desire to fool or lie to oneself to avoid recognizing unflattering truths
about ourselfs or cherished beliefs we may hold dear, even while recognizing
on some level its wrongness.

The first one is prejudice, which is even seen by Abdu'l-Baha as the primary
cause of war:

>  And the breeding-ground of all these tragedies is prejudice: prejudice 
>  of race and nation, of religion, of political opinion; and the root 
>  cause of prejudice is blind imitation of the past -- imitation in religion, 
>  in racial attitudes, in national bias, in politics. So long as this 
>  aping of the past persisteth, just so long will the foundations of the 
>  social order be blown to the four winds, just so long will humanity 
>  be continually exposed to direst peril.
>        (Abdu'l-Baha, Selections from the Writings of Abdu'l-Baha, p. 247)

Prejudice is frequently the result of receiving unquestioned assumptions about
"the way things are"; generally, unthinking reflection of beliefs passed down
from our parents, our peer groups, the media we consume. The writings refer
to this as "blind imitation," and identify it as the main reason for unnecessary
contention in the world. In many cases, blind imitation is the cause of
religious dogmatism (surprise!) (ok, maybe not).

>  At the same time the basic foundation of the religion of God, which was 
>  ever the principle of love, unity and the fellowship of humanity, has 
>  been forsaken and cast aside, each religious system holding tenaciously 
>  to imitations of ancestral forms as the supreme essential. Therefore, 
>  hatred and hostility have appeared in the world instead of the divine 
>  fruitage of unity and love.
>      (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 442)

But "tribe membership" and nationalism this can just as easily lead to other 
bigotries caused by blind imitation.

>  The nations and religions are steeped in blind and bigoted imitations. A 
>  man is a Jew because his father was a Jew. The Muslim follows implicitly 
>  the footsteps of his ancestors in belief and observance. The Buddhist is 
>  true to his heredity as a Buddhist. That is to say, they profess religious belief 
>  blindly and without investigation, making unity and agreement impossible.
>      (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 140)

The solution to this is _independent investigation of reality_. Which is to say,
not a corrosive cynicism which believes nothing, but a willingness to apply a
healthy skepticism to received beliefs, and a healthy questioning and curious
attitude toward life.

>   `O My Brother, journey upon these planes in the spirit of search, not in blind imitation.
>            (Baha'u'llah, The Seven Valleys, p. 23)

>   There have issued, from His [Baha'u'llah's] mighty Pen, various teachings for 
>   the prevention of war, and these have been scattered far and wide.
>
>   The first is the independent investigation of truth; for blind imitation of 
>   the past will stunt the mind. But once every soul inquireth into truth, society 
>   will be freed from the darkness of continually repeating the past.
>             (Abdu'l-Baha, Selections from the Writings of Abdu'l-Baha, p. 248)


Curiousity and learning are to be praised, and superstition avoided. Certain
parts of American society have become increasingly opposed to higher learning, but
there is absolutely no justification
for this outlook within the Baha'i Faith. Baha'i thought is to desire learning
for its own sake:

>  Shoghi Effendi [the sole Baha'i authority of the early- and mid-20th century]
>  has for years urged the Bahá'ís (who asked his advice, and in general also) 
>  to study history, economics, sociology, etc., in order to be au courant with 
>  all the progressive movements and thoughts being put forth today, and so 
>  that they could correlate these to the Bahá'í teachings. What he wants the 
>  Bahá'ís to do is to study more, not to study less. The more general knowledge, 
>  scientific and otherwise, they possess, the better.
>         (The Universal House of Justice, 1997 Aug 13, Science and Religion, p. 3)

The Baha'i community in Iran has been subjugated for years. One of the most persistent
punishments the government has place on the Baha'i community is to bar them from
enrollment in universities and other institutions of higher learning. The reason 
they do this is twofold. First, in the years
prior to the Iranian revolution, Baha'is attended universities in far greater numbers
than would be expected given their proportions of the population. While many 
Iranians are uncomfortable with
the treatment of the Baha'i community by their government, they are also aware that
there is a persistent shortage of slots for univerity enrollment in Iran. Second,
they are aware that higher learning was something treasured by Baha'is, and the fact
that this may be seen as particularly cruel to the community gives the Iranian
authorities all the more reason to do it.

Given this background, most Baha'is would view avoidance of higher education as
sheer folly. It is true that a strict, regimented university degree is not for
all, or perhaps even the majority. But it is also true that a zeal for learning and
curiousity throughout one's life is key to developing both one's character and
capabilities.

Superstition, on the other hand, does the opposite.

>  Suffer not thyself to become the instrument for the dissemination of new superstitions
>      (Baha'u'llah, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 164)

>  People for the most part delight in superstitions. They regard a single drop of 
>  the sea of delusion as preferable to an ocean of certitude.
>       (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 58)

You, gentle reader, are of course immune to superstition, and you and I can both
imagine looking down our nose at the non-numerically inclined, those that believe
in lucky sneakers, picking lucky lotto numbers, passing on tales of magical
pilgramage sites, and merrily reading _The DaVinci Code_ sequels as if they were
nonfiction.

But we may have other cherished beliefs - the "dust of acquired knowldge." Things like
our own pet theories about the way the world works, borrowed from influences like
your family, your peer group, or from watching countless movies. Or perhaps such
beliefs are unhappy side-effects
of painful events in our past. Or they may be picked up unconsciously
from the culture generally, like the
internal beliefs that interpret everything as a conflict that I pointed out early
in the book. It does not need to be an easily-ridiculed superstion to be false.

Finally, I'd like to close this with two sources of error pointed out by the Baha'i
faith that often escape attention, even by the most intelligent and sound of thinkers.

One is "Attachment". The quote I'll begin with is _not_ Baha'i, and very well-known.

>  It is difficult for someone to see a truth when his paycheck is dependent
>  upon not seeing it.
>          Upton Sinclair

>  [In London] ...a Canon of the Anglican Church met him [Abdu'l-Baha] at breakfast. 
>  The conversation turned on the reluctance of the rich to part with their 
>  possessions, 'Abdu'l-Bahá, quoting the saying of Jesus, "How hardly shall 
>  they that have riches enter into the Kingdom of Heaven." He remarked that only 
>  when the true seeker finds that attachments to the material are keeping him from 
>  his spiritual heritage, will he gladly enter the way of renunciation.
>                (Abdu'l-Baha, Abdu'l-Baha in London, p. 83)

The word "attachment" is usually used Baha'i beliefs in the sense of attachment
to our own material wealth. Baha'is are repeatedly told to practice the opposite;
detachment. That is, to do what is right and noble, regardless of consequence for
ourselves.

A Baha'i teacher once told me Baha'u'llah specified there were three great
attachments to be avoided: attachment to material things, attachment to rank,
and attachment to "the Kingdom of Names". I haven't been able to trace the source,
but in this context, "attachment to the Kingdom of Names" refers to one who
prides himself on publicly being the embodiment of a virtue; for example, one
who gives publicly strictly to be seen as generous. Perhaps this might be more
simply put as "attachment to having others and yourself think well of oneself".
Whenever dealing with these, these attachments are powerful impediments to our
logic. With attachment, motivated reasoning will bend any argument in service
to its ulterior motives.

And finally, the most shocking and perhaps worst underlying belief.
"The Belief that We are Right". Or, specifically:





## Self-Mastery

It's a common problem Baha'is run into when explaining their beliefs. When people
ask about Baha'i beliefs they want to know:

    OK, what are the laws? What do I have to give up?

Most people, when asked in this manner about their religion, tend to bristle.
They think "that's not the point," but generally don't have a rejoinder that
will fit on a bumper sticker. My guess is that when religious people hear
this question, they think, somewhat cynically, that this is not really a 
good-faith question borne of curiosity, but just a ruse intended to produce 
an answer, which will then be used by the questioner to reject the religious
belief out-of-hand.

Also, if one is a Christian, one is aware of the writings of a certain
Jewish carpenter who had some quite severe words about people who strictly
followed religious laws but did nothing else of value. So the emphasis on
the laws seem quite misplaced when the founder of these religious laws
themselves placed so much emphasis on many other things.

So I'm going to do something counterintuitive. What, you say you're not
a Baha'i? Congratulations, the religious laws binding on you are

**NONE WHATSOEVER**

And as for my advice to you? Follow NONE of them! Indeed, those who are
Baha'i are told that one may not expect anyone who is not a Baha'i to
conform with our moral code, no matter what one's opinion.

But... (and you're waiting for the catch, aren't you).

Part of being a better person is about self-mastery and self-discipline.
You'll have to do those, laws or no laws.

When New Year's rolls around, what's the one thing everyone picks as
a resolution? "Try to be a better person." Or something like that. But
as one famous philosopher once said (6), "There is no try, only do."

So self-mastry is really the art of doing what is required to convert
'try' into 'do'. Part of self-mastery is practical skills. Things
like proper diet, study, time management, punctuality, and a number of
things all fold into that, but these are hardly unique to Baha'i; indeed,
they're hardly religious.

So there's another element of self-mastery which is important, and that's
involving management or elimination of various 'temptations.' Now,
unfortunately, 'temptations' is a word most often used in ad copy for
deserts and various fat-free treats, but let's break down what a
tempttion is: Something
compelling enough that it make you do what you don't want to do.
What does the Baha'i Faith say about managing those? Or rather, what
would a 'typical Baha'i' do that you might benefit from?

### Addictions

One of the most disastrous things that can happen to you is to fall
victim to an addition. You can work on self-improvement for years,
but for an addict, this often becomes the _one thing_ that dominates
ones life. Some additions are relatively harmless; your morning caffiene
addition is something that will cause you only you to suffer if you don't
get your fix. And if you're someone who still smokes (sorry), you're probably just as
sick of smelling like an ashtray as everyone else, and it long since
ceased to be fun to stand out in the rain for smoke breaks and receive
lectures from your doctor on what you're doing to your lungs.

But many additions are much worse, in that they actually impede
your character as a person. People have ruined their own lives and even
the lives of others through alcohol addition, gambling too much,
developing expensive drug habits, compulsively engaging in adulterous affairs,
you name it. If you fall prey to one of these addictions, throw out
this book, because the good you will do from these practices is a drop in
the bucket compared to the effort you need at controlling your addition.

The Baha'i laws are seen as a bit old-fashioned by some - indeed, many
think religious laws themselves are outdated. However, upon examining
Baha'i laws, there seem to be just a few animating purposes:

- questions of community organizing and collective decision making;
- various exhortations for improved behavior and spiritual growth;
- various interdictions meant to control behaviors known to be addictive.

And so: it will not surprise you that some of the laws that are the
least popular to those who are not Baha'i are as follows:

- No taking of addictive substances causing impariment in any
form, _including alcohol_;
- No gambling;
- No extramarital sex.

Now, I'm not going to tell you to do this. However, you should recognize
that these laws were put there for a reason. And one thing that gives
Baha'i communities their positive character are that Baha'is, for
whatever their flaws, are at least free from these harmful additions.

I'm not going to tell you that having a little beer once in a while
is harmful, or that one trip to Vegas could ruin your life, or that 
having sex with your serious girlfriend of two years is going to corrupt
you as a person. None of those are demonstrably true. It's a little
more iffy to use a "slippery slope" argument on you, either I don't
find it believable of myself as a person:<
if I get drunk I vomit. I'm so loss-averse that if I
gamble, the amount is so insignificant as it doesn't matter to me. And I
don't have the looks that would allow me to engage in carnal activites
with anyone other than, say, someone actually married to me. So I could
probably bend the rules all I like and get away with them.
And the same may apply to you.

But let's get back to the purpose of the book. The purpose is to
impart to you lessons from the Baha'i Faith on how to improve your
life; lessons meant to make you happier no matter what your status
is; lessons on how to be a better person to be around.
These particular activities, should you indulge themselves, are activites
that require you to be extremely adult in judging your own limits
when you are unimpaired. And unfortunately, these are all activities
which will impair your judgement _while you are
doing them_. Have you ever had a night out that you regretted?
One of these activities was involved - guaranteed.

#### Bonus Section: On Lust

I flagged extramarital sex. If there is one rule that people (especially
young people) find objectionable, it's this one. So, one more thought
on this.

Let's suppose you are young and fetching, or tall and attractive,
whatever is considered attractive to the opposite sex nowadays. And
you are essentially able, whenever you wish, to bed someone attractive.
I'm going to go out on a limb (and this is _not_ supported in the
Baha'i writings) and say you could probably engage in all sorts of
casual carnal relations and have it not affect you morally. Why would it?
You have a natural drive and you're simply fulfilling it.

The blinkered response to this is that you are engaging in the
sin of Lust. But that is not true. You are engaging in something quite
different.

Please be aware that if you are among this group, you are in very
select company. Studies have shown that less than 20% of all people
are engaged in over half of all "couplings." If you've ever taken a
date out on Valentine's day, or gone to vacation in a popular honeymoon
spot, you'll notice - you're suddenly surrounded by sexually desireable
people. You may be among these. But whether you are or not, you're among
the elite few that are enjoying the fruits of the sexual revolution.

If you are doing this, and hopping from one relation to another without
regard for others, the "sin," if you will, is one of Gluttony. That is,
consuming a resource simply because you can without regard for the needs 
of others. Because many of your partners are not similarly situated. Strings
or not, you will wind up using other people. As far as your own happiness,
know that your present situation is entirely contingent. If you are a
woman and enjoy your situation for your looks and youth, know that this is
going to change. If you are a man, this may not change as quickly, but
if part of your appeal is your status, career or wealth, it very well could.
Your own happiness requires that you do not mistake what is a temporary
situation as a permanent state of affairs.

As for gluttony, what is the "limited resource" being consumed? Why, simply
the lives of others. Particularly in the case of men, who frequently find
themselves in long term relationships simply because it's easier than finding
a steady stream of sexual partners.
One of the reasons of the depressed birth rate
in the Western world is due to women coupling up in their childbearing
years with men who surreptitionsly have no intention of fathering
children. Instead, their interest is mainly in sex, and such men conveniently
find another partner when their interest wanes (generally once the woman's
fertility has started to wane). Psychologists estimate that each "stringer"
out there results, on average, in around two women losing their fertile
years. Such women usually wind up childless, or perhaps lucky to have
just one child.

None of the above discussion is Lust, in any way.

Lust is "excessive desire." And this is the problem with everyone else
outside of said relationships.

Lust is not engaging in multiple carnal relations that seem to magically
come your way. Lust is hounding a woman with the goal to "win" her, as
if she is a trophy for persistence. Lust is repeatedly drunk-testing your ex, who
you're still in love with.







### Self-Indulgence

One of the temptations of current Western society is "affluenza"; a
blase' attitude toward life caused by excessive self-indulgence:

>  Despair, both here and hereafter, is all you will gain from 
>  self-indulgence; abomination and misery are all you will harvest from 
>  fanaticism, from believing the foolish and the mindless.
>           (Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 104)

The cure for this is in service:

>  Senses and faculties have been bestowed upon us, to be devoted to 
>  the service of the general good; so that we, distinguished above all 
>  other forms of life for perceptiveness and reason, should labor at 
>  all times and along all lines, whether the occasion be great or 
>  small, ordinary or extraordinary, until all mankind are safely gathered 
>  into the impregnable stronghold of knowledge. We should continually be 
>  establishing new bases for human happiness and creating and promoting 
>  new instrumentalities toward this end. How excellent, how honorable 
>  is man if he arises to fulfil his responsibilities; how wretched and 
>  contemptible, if he shuts his eyes to the welfare of society and wastes 
>  his precious life in pursuing his own selfish interests and personal 
>  advantages.
>             (Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 3)

>  It is enjoined upon every one of you to engage in some form of 
>  occupation, such as crafts, trades and the like. We have graciously 
>  exalted your engagement in such work to the rank of worship unto God, 
>  the True One. Ponder ye in your hearts the grace and the blessings 
>  of God and render thanks unto Him at eventide and at dawn. Waste 
>  not your time in idleness and sloth. Occupy yourselves with that 
>  which profiteth yourselves and others.
>                  (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 26)

>  It is enjoined upon every one of you to engage in some form of 
>  occupation, such as crafts, trades and the like. We have graciously 
>  exalted your engagement in such work to the rank of worship unto God, 
>  the True One.
>                  (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 26)

The core facet of Baha'i life is one of _service_. For this reason,
many Baha'is volunteer to serve in like-minded organizations. This
extends to choosing one's professions or jobs.

This concept of humanitarian service is so important that Baha'i temples
themselves are supposed to be given to this. As clarified in the 
commentary around the temple:

>  The Bahá'í House of Worship is dedicated to the praise of
>  God. The House of Worship forms the central edifice of the
>  Mashriqu'l-Adhkar (the Dawning-place of the Praise of
>  God), a complex which, as it unfolds in the future, will
>  comprise in addition to the House of Worship a number of
>  dependencies dedicated to social, humanitarian, educational,
>  and scientific pursuits.
>    (Authorized translator's comments, Baha'u'llah's The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 190)


Service is the key to fighting self-indulgent behavior.

I understand that many of you readers are already ridiculously busy.
You may find talk of self-indulgence must apply to other people, but
not you. And it probably does!
And some of us have taken jobs out of pure necessity, jobs that
may not even serve others.

If you're reading this book and you're young, you're fortunate. If
you're among the lucky minority that could complete college studies,
then one can actually chose to align one's profession to service with
mankind. This is particularly true since most of your waking hours
will probably be spent in paid work. Some of the most taxing, demotivating
work is work where you can't actually understand who is being served,
or work which accomplishes things to the wrong end.

If you are among the lucky few, you already have a job fulfilling both the
needs of others and using talents you alone bring to the world.
Congratulations! You're probably already thinking of finding a fulfilling
career that you believe in. And far more than when I was in college, there
are books that will actually recommend specific actions. The excellent
website <https://80000hours.com> is an especially good one for those
eager to do good work while one works.

And if you do have spare time, there are always activities in your community
that need doing. The problem may simply be one of inertia. It is always
much harder to get started than it needs to be. But service and the sense
of gratitude that comes with it are going to raise your mood much more
than staying at home, escaping with video games or ruminating.

It is true that it may take some work finding an appropriate job, particularly
if your talents are peculiar. But if you can think of a job, you can think
of a job that helps someone.

Note: there will always be unpleasant jobs that pay well, but actually
contribute negatively to society. You can make more money programming
addictive games and social networks than you can working on HR software
so that people can get paid. You'll make more writing ad copy or working
for a PR firm that misleads people than you will teaching English at
a community college or doing investigative journalism.

But if you picked up this book, you've probably realized that there
are more important things than getting paid well or looking like a
"winner." It's your life, and a significant chunk of it is going to
consist of doing things for others. It's your job to make sure you
see the meaning in it and believe in it. Note that it is _not_ on you
to go into the _most_ meaningful job you could possibly do. Everyone
has to eat, after all. But my rule of thumb: if you can't stand what
your business is, you probably won't be able to stand the bosses who
run that business, and you probably won't like what will be asked of you
as a person.

### Self Restraint Excercise: The Fast

One way to improve your restraint is to practice it. Wouldn't you know
it, many religions have actual exercises to practice it. The Baha'i
Faith has one such exercise:

    [For the nineteen days prior to the Vernal Equinox (the start of spring),] 
    abstinence from food and drink, from sunrise to sunset, is obligatory.(7)

	(Shoghi Effendi's "Synopis and Codification" of Baha'u'llah's Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 148)

There are plenty of exemptions - for sickness, old age, menstration,
traveling and the like. But the expectation is that if you are a Baha'i,
you will do this. The justification given for asking for this fast by
Baha'u'llah? "For the love of My Beauty." In other words, for no other
reason than that he asks us to.

This isn't much of a logical reason, and Baha'is don't ask for one.
But there is no doubt that fasting is a common discipline practiced
by many religions, and the reason is obvious: to get you used to not
doing things you feel compelled to do, _just because you can_.

For many people serious about study of the Baha'i Faith, this becomes
the dividing line; the signal to themselves that they are
serious about following the teachings. But many find that the are
also surprised at the fact they are able to follow the fast for
all nineteen days, even though they know they could stop at any time.

So if you're serious about exercising your self-restraint, it's worth
thinking about this Baha'i teaching.

### Self-Mastery of Material Means

One thing Baha'is do is tithe. Or rather, they pay something called
The Huquq'u'llah (the Right of God). This is expected, but is done 
entirely voluntary; no one can ask you to pay, and you must offer it
voluntarily. But that isn't terribly special.

Except for the way it's calculated. It is calculated as a percentage
of your income _after one deducts all necessary expenses_, including
things such as household furnishings, tools for one's profession, and
whatever else you may consider yourself necessary.

The result is you must review how you are spending your money. And
this review can be eye-opening.

* You may find that you are financially overcommitted and, indeed,
have no wealth on which Huquq'u'llah is payable.

* You may find that while your necessary expenses are sizable, the
are manageable, and it is relatively easy to pay Huquq'u'llah on
the rest.

* But for everyone else - you're going to find that you have a
lot of unnecessary expenses; so much so, that if you found you had
to pay a levy on them, it might be a little painful.

The purpose of this section is not to talk about how great contributing
is. If you have no religion, you incur no obligation to give, period.
And this is not the point.

The point is, _the mere act of examining your expenses_ is a significant
one, and very helpful to both your self-mastry and your own ability
to provide for yourself and whoever else you may wish to support.


### Your Life and Life-Stages

This gets to another important but subtle point.

Why do you need self-control? So you can control your life. So that
you can live for something.

If your goal is to lead a life in the emulation of great humanitarians
that dedicate your life to noble causes, forgoing family and home in
service to a noble cause, great! Go have fun.

I'm not going to make the mistake of asking you to do that though.

One problem with the sort of inspirational and hagoigraphic literature
that litter both religous and idealistic causes is the concept of the
single-minded servant of the cause, dedicating every waking moment
to serving others and making a difference on the grandest canvas.
Without, of course, ever doing this in a vainglorious, ego-driven
manner of course.

If you have this sort of mission, you will certainly need an iron
self-control. But it's unrealistic to expect everyone will. And
realistically, society would be horrible if that was the mass of
people.

Why? If everyone was like this, who would do the urgent work of
society? Would such people have time to marry? Certainly, the most
single-minded and idealistic sometimes have trouble dedicating the
committment and energy needed to both their cause and their partner.
And who will have children? And raise them? If you're lucky, perhaps
you'll find a dutiful spouse that will raise your children and run
your household while you're off saving the world.

For most of us, you will instead have three life stages.

1. Independence (Trade or Profession)

2. Marriage

3. Childrearing

In the Baha'i Faith, all of these are normative, and one of them,
engagement in a trade or profession, is required.

If you aspire to any level of self-mastery, it's probably a given that
you have the first one under your belt, or at least are working toward
that. This book will help you. And in fact, a lot of other books will help
you. Books that will help you conquer your weaknesses, act as a professional
and an independent person, become a citizen of the world, everything.

Once you've finished, you're somehow supposed to take your then overfull
life and force in marriage and kids in your spare time, as if it's just one
other item in your checklist. Having trouble with those? Go buy another
self-help book.

If you truly want to give yourself over to a cause, and don't mind forgoing
marriage or children, then you can live life that way. In which case, the
cause you are following must truly be a life-defining passion.

For most of you, though, you'll need to fit in all of these things. That
means balance. If you want to give yourself over to service but also have
a domestic life and the time to raise children, then your work and career
will have to be in accord with this. You won't have "spare time" to do this.
There's a reason so many people have dreams of following their passion, or
giving themselves over to volunteer work - once you get married and start
having children, you will have little time and energy for such things. Even
if you're a "stay at home Mom" (or Dad), you will have to balance these
elements.

What is the point here? The point is that you need to confront this reality
head on. You cannot "have it all," if having it all means time to excel in
your career, 


## Globalism

If there's one thing Baha'i beliefs are known for, it's globalism.

Part of this is simply accidental; many small religious movements are
global simply as an expedience - local communities are simply too
small to generate a critical mass of contacts. Should you go to a
Jehovah's convention, Seventh-Day Adventist or Scientology conclave,
you'll hear about communities from around the world. 

But for the Baha'i faith, globalism is wired into the very character of
the religion itself:

>  Let your vision be world-embracing, rather than confined to your own self.
>         (Baha'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 94)

To be a Baha'i is to consider oneself as a citizen of the world, first and
foremost.

>  Glory not in love for your country, but in love for all mankind.
>       (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 138)

>  Of old it hath been revealed: 'Love of one's country is an element of the 
>  Faith of God.' The Tongue of Grandeur hath, however, in the day of His 
>  manifestation proclaimed: 'It is not his to boast who loveth his country, 
>  but it is his  88  who loveth the world.'
>       (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 87)

Nationalism is noted as the main cause of war, which the Baha'i Faith is
opposed to in all its forms:

>  ... selfish souls, for the promotion of their own interests, have assigned 
>  boundaries and outlets and have, day by day, attached more importance to 
>  these, until this led to intense enmity, bloodshed and rapacity in subsequent 
>  centuries. In the same way this will continue indefinitely, and if this 
>  conception of patriotism remains limited within a certain circle, it will be 
>  the primary cause of the world's destruction. No wise and just person will 
>  acknowledge these imaginary distinctions.
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, Selections from the Writings of Abdu'l-Baha, p. 300)

>  Consider the prejudice of patriotism. This is one globe, one land, one 
>  country. God did not divide it into national boundaries. He created all the 
>  continents without national divisions. Why should we make such division ourselves? 
>  These are but imaginary lines and boundaries.
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 299)


The Baha'i leader Shoghi Effendi
easily foresaw the problems nationalism posed at the eve of the second world war:

>  The chief idols in the desecrated temple of mankind are none other than the 
>  triple gods of Nationalism, Racialism and Communism, at whose altars governments 
>  and peoples, whether democratic or totalitarian, at peace or at war, of the East 
>  or of the West, Christian or Islamic, are, in various forms and in different 
>  degrees, now worshiping. Their high priests are the politicians and the 
>  worldly-wise, the so-called sages of the age; their sacrifice, the flesh and 
>  blood of the slaughtered multitudes; their incantations outworn shibboleths and 
>  insidious and irreverent formulas; their incense, the smoke of anguish that 
>  ascends from the lacerated hearts of the bereaved, the maimed, and the homeless.
>
>  The theories and policies, so unsound, so pernicious, which deify the state 
>  and exalt the nation above mankind, which seek to subordinate the sister races 
>  of the world to one single race, which discriminate between the black and the 
>  white, and which tolerate the dominance of one privileged class over all 
>  others -- these are the dark, the false, and crooked doctrines for which any 
>  man or people who believes in them, or acts upon them, must, sooner or later, 
>  incur the wrath and chastisement of God.
>
>                (Shoghi Effendi, The Promised Day is Come, p. 113)

Recent Baha'i writings are unsparing in their assessment of nationalistic movements,
movements which echo altogether too closely certain movements of the early twentieth
century:

>  Long before it and its leader had been swept into oblivion during the concluding months of the 
>  second world war, Fascism had become an object of ridicule among the majority of even those who 
>  had originally supported it. Its significance lies, rather, in the host of 
>  imitators it spawned and which 
>  were to proliferate throughout the world like some malignant series of mutations, in the decades 
>  since then. Fuelled by a manic nationalism, this aberration of the human spirit deified the state, 
>  discovered everywhere imaginary threats to the national survival of whatever unhappy people it 
>  had fastened upon, and preached to all who would listen the notion that war has an “ennobling” 
>  influence on the human soul. The comic opera parade of uniforms, jackboots, banners and trumpets 
>  usually associated with it should not conceal from a contemporary observer the virulent legacy it 
>  has left in our own age...

and continuing likewise,

>  Like Fascism, Naziism has left a detritus in 
>  our own time. In its case, this takes the form of a language and symbols through which fringe 
>  elements in present-day society, demoralized by the economic and social decay around them and 
>  made desperate by the absence of solutions, vent their impotent rage on minorities whom they 
>  blame for their disappointments.
>                 (_Centry of Light_, on behalf of Universal House of Justice)

So much for what the Baha'i faith teaches and what it condemns. The question is -
how does it help you? What do are
_you_ going to do about it?

This is where the globalist attitude inculcated by the Baha'i Faith is helpful.

The purpose of globalism is not to nullify patriotism, nor to defeat violent
nationalistic groups. Its purpose is to separate and
distinguish a legitimate and salutory patriotism from nationalism. They two
tendencies are often viewed as two sides of
the same coin. They are not. Love for one's country is not the same as
zeal for its unconditioned triumph over others.

>  [The Baha'i teachings] should not, indeed it cannot, be construed as a 
>  repudiation, or regarded in the light of a censure, pronounced against a sane 
>  and intelligent patriotism, nor does it seek to undermine the allegiance and 
>  loyalty of any individual to his country, nor does it conflict with the 
>  legitimate aspirations, rights, and duties of any individual state or nation. 
>  All it does imply and proclaim is the insufficiency of patriotism, in view of 
>  the fundamental changes effected in the economic life of society and the 
>  interdependence of the nations, and as the consequence of the contraction of 
>  the world, through the revolution in the means of transportation and 
>  communication  -- conditions that did not and could not exist either in the 
>  days of Jesus Christ or of Muhammad. It calls for a wider loyalty, which 
>  should not, and indeed does not, conflict with lesser loyalties.
>       (Shoghi Effendi, The Promised Day is Come, p. 122)

One of the more distinctive forms of Baha'i universalism is its insistence upon
everyone learning a universal auxiliary language:

>  It is incumbent upon all nations to appoint some men of understanding and 
>  erudition to convene a gathering and  166  through joint consultation choose 
>  one language from among the varied existing languages, or create a new one, 
>  to be taught to the children in all the schools of the world.
>
>  The day is approaching when all the peoples of the world will have adopted 
>  one universal language and one common script. When this is achieved, to 
>  whatsoever city a man may journey, it shall be as if he were entering his own 
>  home. These things are obligatory and absolutely essential.
>                 (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 165)


Baha'u'llah did not insist on a choice of auxiliary language, instead recommending
that the leaders of the world gather together to select a common language and
script. Something that has worked out about as well as he no doubt imagined it
would. This was not for lack of effort; in the twentieth century, many Baha'is
were avid Esperantists, and Lydia Zamenhof, a daughter of the inventor of
Esperanto, was a prominent early Baha'i.

Ironically, one language, with little in common with
Esperanto, currently fills that gap for many
This language is learned by virtually all of the economic elites
throughout the world. I will not say what it is, because it will horrify all
of the globalists out there. I'll just say that it's probably the dominant
"pop culture" language, and it isn't French, and it isn't Mandarin
Chinese, and it isn't Korean, and.... well, you get the
picture. If you're a middle American who thought it wasn't worth your while to
learn another language, well... guess what?

(And yes, the primary language used by the Baha'i authorities in nearly all of
their communications outside of the Baha'i homeplaces is English.)

But if you're an idealist who still wants to contribute to globalism, there are
plenty of jobs for native English speakers teaching other people colloquial
English. Meanwhile if you're looking to learn a language to help communicate
with people around the world - it may be a more effective use of your time to
simply learn how to communicate a few grade levels down, for all the people
who speak "just a little English." (I'm personally horrible at this.)

The underlying impetus for this universalism leads Baha'is to _actually look
forward_ to a day where some form of federal superstate is able to regulate
the abuses of unfettered nationalism.

>  What else could these weighty words signify if they did not point to the 
>  inevitable curtailment of unfettered national sovereignty as an indispensable 
>  preliminary to the formation of the future Commonwealth of all the nations 
>  of the world? Some form of a world super-state must needs be evolved, in 
>  whose favor all the nations of the world will have willingly ceded every claim 
>  to make war, certain rights to impose taxation and all rights to maintain 
>  armaments, except for purposes of maintaining internal order within their 
>  respective dominions. Such a state will have to include within its orbit 
>  an international executive adequate to enforce supreme and unchallengeable 
>  authority on every recalcitrant member of the commonwealth; a world 
>  parliament whose members shall be elected by the people in their respective 
>  countries and whose election shall be confirmed by their respective governments; 
>  and a supreme tribunal whose judgment will have a binding effect even in 
>  such cases where the parties concerned did not voluntarily agree to submit 
>  their case to its consideration. A world community in which all economic barriers 
>  will have been permanently demolished and the interdependence of Capital and 
>  Labor definitely recognized; in which the clamor of religious fanaticism and 
>  strife will have been forever stilled; in which the flame of racial animosity 
>  will have been finally extinguished; in which a single code of international 
>  law -- the product of the considered judgment of the world's federated 
>  representatives -- shall have as its sanction the instant and coercive 
>  intervention of the combined forces of the federated units; and finally a 
>  world community in which the fury of a capricious and militant nationalism 
>  will have been transmuted into an abiding consciousness of world citizenship -- 
>  such indeed, appears, in its broadest outline, the Order anticipated by 
>  Bahá'u'lláh, an Order that shall come to be regarded as the fairest fruit 
>  of a slowly maturing age.
>        (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Baha'u'llah, p. 40)

Oh, and there's plenty more like that.

>  A mechanism of world inter-communication will be devised, embracing the whole 
>  planet, freed from national hinderances and restrictions, and functioning with 
>  marvellous swiftness and perfect regularity. A world metropolis will act as

>  nations as an auxiliary to their mother tongue. A world script, a world

>         (Shoghi Effendi, The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah, p. xi)

Yes, Baha'is actually believe that. Baha'is have backed the aims of the United Nations
during its first initial idealistic years, and continue to work with it even
as the problems inherent in its structure and the corruption of its mandate
by member states have become all too clear. To Baha'is, global thinking is a
moral imperative, and fears borne of conspiracy theorizing are simply too
far removed to prevent positive action involving international cooperation. To
this end, Baha'is are told to work for the day where a sort of "World Federation"
of all nations enforce universal human rights, work together for matters
common to all (such as pollution control) and prevent the unjust wars of
corrupt governments against their neighbors and "internal enemies."

Underlying all of this is a unifying moral imperative - to treat all the
members of the world as members of the same family deserving respect.(8)

And if you want to feel special about America, you can continue to do so; Baha'i
writings single out America in particular as having a spiritual heritage to defend.
In 1938 Shoghi Effendi wrote these words, to an America which still proclaimed
isolationalism:

>  Outmmediate future must, as a result of this steady, this gradual, 
>  and inevitable absorption in the manifold perplexities and problems 
>  afflicting humanity, be dark and oppressive for that nation. The 
>  world-shaking ordeal which Bahá'u'lláh, as quoted in the foregoing 
>  pages, has so graphically prophesied, may find it swept, to an 
>  unprecedented degree, into its vortex. Out of it it [America] will 
>  probably emerge, unlike its reactions to the last world conflict, 
>  consciously determined to seize its opportunity, to bring the full 
>  weight of its influence to bear upon the gigantic problems that such 
>  an ordeal must leave in its wake, and to exorcise forever, in 
>  conjunction with its sister nations of both the East and the West, 
>  the greatest curse which, from time immemorial, has afflicted and degraded the human race.
>
>  Then, and only then, will the American nation, molded and purified in 
>  the crucible of a common war, inured to its rigors, and disciplined by 
>  its lessons, be in a position to raise its voice in the councils of the 
>  nations, itself lay the cornerstone of a universal and enduring peace, 
>  proclaim the solidarity, the unity, and maturity of mankind, and assist 
>  in the establishment of the promised reign of righteousness on earth. 
>  Then, and only then, will the American nation, while the community of 
>  the American believers within its heart is consummating its divinely 
>  appointed mission, be able to fulfill the unspeakably glorious destiny 
>  ordained for it by the Almighty, and immortally enshrined in the writings 
>  of 'Abdu'l-Bahá.
>
>              (Shoghi Effendi, The Advent of Divine Justice, p. 90)

Universalism is embedded into the fabric of the Baha'i Faith. If you
want to understand the culture around us, this is the most apparent way
to start.

A small warning about "globalism":
One of the particular ironies of this present day is the globalism
and universalism called for by by the Baha'i writings, as practiced by
_individuals_, has not been as beneficial in practice
when this same quality is applied to societies. Critics of globalism
should be careful to make this important distinction. It is possible to
be globalist and universalist in outlook, and yet also regard the critics
of "globalism" as it is currently embodied as very much having legitimate grievances. On the
opening of the twenty-first century, the Universal House of Justice
wrote as follows:

>  In the perspective of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings, the greatest danger of both the moral crisis and the 
>  inequities associated with globalization in its current form is an entrenched philosophical attitude 
>  that seeks to justify and excuse these failures. The overthrow of the twentieth century’s totalitarian

Unfortunately, a common trope among critics of globalsm is to essentially
blame everyone with a passport or working knowledge of a second language
as being part of an unelected "elite" which has thrust this on the
hard-working people of America. Let's be clear about this; holding the
belief that all the members the earth are brothers in the eyes of God in
no way makes you complicit in the problems of globalization. And those who
would despise such people as insufficiently patriotic are badly misled,
perhaps willingly. Someone who is upset due to the loss of jobs to lower
paying countries has a point, even if you disagree with it. But if someone 
is upset with you because you fail to be
incensed by street signs in spanish, this says far more about their moral
character than yours.

## Special USA Mandate: Antiracism

There is one peculiar mandate that is particularly peculiar to the American
Baha'i community. For this, you have to credit the aftereffects of our
own "peculiar institution" - slavery.

Yes, you can pull all sorts of studies out and say "this is natural, people
refer to the own kind blah blah." But. Only in America did we have a
form of chattel slavery that allowed the selling of children as if they
were cattle to perpetuate the institution. Only in America did we have
the infamous Dredd Scott decision, in which it was declared that black
people were incapable of being true citizens. Only in America did we
inclulcate racist theories to children to ensure continued support for
an institution that plainly ran counter to obvious notions of fairness.
And only here did we allow our religious institutions to become so
bastardized in support of this cause that they became willing allies
in support of this horrible institution.

Baha'is generally don't talk about rectification or recourse for justice;
our concern is the after-effects of the racist beliefs that have been perpetuated
throughout the culture.

When Abdu'l-Baha visited America for 239 days in 1912, just years before 
World War I, the elimination of racism and prejudice was a particular concern
to him. While that didn't make him unique, it was an fairly unusual 
position at the time, and the historical
record about his visit wrote about his multiracial crowds in either amazement
or bemusement.
And this was purposeful - Abdu'l-Baha made an obvious point to
integrate his gatherings wherever possible. In many cases where it was
considered as breaking decorum to simply have black people in attendance, he was
careful to have blacks there and point out that they had no less right to attend
than the white people in attendance, believers or not. 




Our purpose here isn't to thump our chest; a sizeable minority of Christians at the
time felt the same way (though they were generally shouted down by
their less enlightened fellow believers). In fact, one reason Abdu'l-Baha
was so strenouous in this insistence was to ensure the very young
Baha'i community did not adopt the racist outlook that was endemic
throughout America at the time.

Indeed, there were some isolated holdouts, and it took perhaps a decade or two
to stamp
out segregated meetings, and there were still residual problems in communities.
In a book-length 1938 letter to the American community, the Baha'i
supreme authority Shoghi Effendi outlined the steps that both whites and
blacks must take to effect racial unity in America. His concern was primarily
an American Baha'i community, and rallied his followers as follows:
 
>   As to racial prejudice, the corrosion of which, for well-nigh a century, 
>   has bitten into the fiber, and attacked the whole social structure of 
>   American society, it should be regarded as constituting the most vital 
>   and challenging issue confronting the Bahá'í community at the present 
>   stage of its evolution. The ceaseless exertions which this issue of 
>   paramount importance calls for, the sacrifices it must impose, the 
>   care and vigilance it demands, the moral courage and fortitude it 
>   requires, the tact and sympathy it necessitates, invest this problem, 
>   which the American believers are still far from having satisfactorily 
>   resolved, with an urgency and importance that cannot be overestimated.
>            (Shoghi Effendi, The Advent of Divine Justice, p. 33)

Nor was he particularly concerned about reverse discrimination becoming a
problem:

>  If any discrimination is at all to be tolerated, it should be a 
>  discrimination not against, but rather in favor of the minority, 
>  be it racial or otherwise. Unlike the nations and peoples of the 
>  earth, be they of the East or of the West, democratic or authoritarian, 
>  communist or capitalist, whether belonging to the Old World or the 
>  New, who either ignore, trample upon, or extirpate, the racial, 
>  religious, or political minorities within the sphere of their 
>  jurisdiction, every organized community enlisted under the banner of 
>  Bahá'u'lláh should feel it to be its first and inescapable obligation 
>  to nurture, encourage, and safeguard every minority belonging to any 
>  faith, race, class, or nation within it. So great and vital is 
>  this principle that in such circumstances, as when an equal number 
>  of ballots have been cast in an election, or where the qualifications

So much for color-blindness as being the solution to racial prejudice!!

As for overcoming prejudice, note that the directions
given to the two races differ:

>  Let the white make a supreme effort in their resolve to contribute 
>  their share to the solution of this problem, to abandon once for 
>  all their usually inherent and at times subconscious sense of 
>  superiority, to correct their tendency towards revealing a 
>  patronizing attitude towards the members of the other race, to 
>  persuade them through their intimate, spontaneous and informal 
>  association with them of the genuineness of their friendship 
>  and the sincerity of their intentions, and to master their impatience 
>  of any lack of responsiveness on the part of a people who have 
>  received, for so long a period, such grievous and slow-healing 
>  wounds. 

>  Let the Negroes, through a corresponding effort on their part, 
>  show by every means in their power the warmth of their response, 
>  their readiness to forget the past, and their ability to wipe 
>  out every trace of suspicion that may still linger in their hearts 
>  and minds. 

>  Let neither think that the solution of so vast a problem is a 
>  matter that exclusively concerns the other. Let neither think that 
>  such a problem can either easily or immediately be resolved. Let 
>  neither think that they can wait confidently for the solution of 
>  this problem until the initiative has been taken, and the favorable 
>  circumstances created, by agencies that stand outside the orbit of 
>  their Faith. Let neither think that anything short of genuine love, 
>  extreme patience, true humility, consummate tact, sound initiative, 
>  mature wisdom, and deliberate, persistent, and prayerful effort, 
>  can succeed in blotting out the stain which this patent evil has 
>  left on the fair name of their common country. Let them rather 
>  believe, and be firmly convinced, that on their mutual understanding, 
>  their amity, and sustained cooperation, must depend, more than on 
>  any other force or organization operating outside the circle of 
>  their Faith, the deflection of that dangerous course so greatly 
>  feared by 'Abdu'l-Bahá, and the materialization of the hopes He 
>  cherished for their joint contribution to the fulfillment of that 
>  country's glorious destiny.
>             (Shoghi Effendi, The Advent of Divine Justice, p. 40)

Sorry for the lengthy quote. But the entire attitude of the American
Baha'i community traces its antiracism efforts back to this letter,
and even further back, to the example his grandfather Abdu'l-Baha set
upon landing on these shores in America.

The most active Baha'is can quote part of the above quotes from memory,
particularly those applying to them. And as America has become more
diverse, the formulation has become more complex. What if you're
hispanic or asian? What if you're a multiracial that passes for white?
At the very least, even if you're an immigrant from a country some
Americans don't like, with a complection some Americans don't like,
you need to be able to navigate this and assist in this effort, even
if you aren't identified as black and are being addressed as if
you should adopt unhelthy attitudes towards the black community in
order to fit in. For example, think of the Asian immigrants who take
pride in their stereotype as a 'model minority', not knowing the whole
concept was brought into being simply as a way of making black
communities look bad in comparison.

Lest you are a white person and believe the above advice does not
apply to you, think again. You believe you are not racist; you don't
think you have a paternalistic attitude; you don't have a subconscious
sense of superiority. And you're friendly to all black people, just as
for all white people. But do you and your friends engage in discussions
about "inner city blacks," as if it's a problem for you and your favorite
politicians to fix? Do you listen to talking heads on YouTube and Facebook
who talk about
problems of "black culture"? About the problems of "black on
black" violence? On how blacks should "pull themselves up by their
bootstraps"? If you do, then you're practically wallowing in media aimed at
making you more paternalistic and superior. One of the first things
you can do around white people to fix racism is to detect this
rampant concern trolling for exactly what it is.

Baha'is view everyone as having an important part in the reduction
of racism in America - particularly the advantaged. The goal isn't
to seem as "woke" (though honestly, do you actually know a single person
who actually says something just so he looks "woke"? Like, a real person you
know, not a vapid stock character in a sitcom or reality show or an unlikeable
foil in a movie?) The goal is simply to be decent, and fix a longstanding
problem in American society.

## On the Limits of Individual Effort

I've outlined a number of beliefs and practices I believe are
distinctly "Baha'i", when taken together as a whole. If you're
reading this book, and you've been inspired to learn more and practice
these in your daily life, you'll not only be happier, but you'll
understand how doing so helps make the world a better place.

If you're reading this book, there is one thing you must keep in mind.
You can live a flawless, blameless life, the sort that everyone looks
up to and influences scores. But even doing so requires a certain amount
of detachment from results.

The Baha'i writings are clear: you are responsible for your own moral
development, and "fixing" the rest of humanity, is not your job. It
is your duty to "teach" the Faith - that is to say, to present your
ideals to others in as dignified and appealing a manner as possible.
These are things that bring joy and happiness to you; why not share them
with others?

But it is not your duty to force others into compliance:

>  For the faith of no man can be conditioned by any one except himself.
>         (Baha'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 143)

You may not pressure anyone
into changing their views; freedom of conscience is paramount As Baha'is
we _must_ present these ideals to the world in the hopes of influence
and wider adoption; we _must not_ seek to press on the unwilling.
The Baha'i writings and Baha'i practices primarily influence ourselves, and
only secondarily others we come in contact with and society.

This means that values we adopt as a result of studying the Baha'i writings
are primarily a benifit for ourselves. We also believe that by doing so,
you become a better person and make the world better. As scores of people
do so, it compounds little by little. Moreover, many like-minded individuals
can work together. Using the methods of consultation and small-scale community
development, you can make positive developments at a small scale. Slowly
over time, the community transforms into a better place. Better yet, such
changes are more organic, with "roots" that are not easily swept away.

However, that may present a problem to you. If you are an idealistic
person, you may want to "change the world." And this does not seem like
a framework for "change the world." To address this, I'll have to go
outside of the writings and then circle back.

Think what you will of America's Founding Fathers, but they knew their
history, and they knew what they were trying to accomplish. 
They wanted a democracy that would not descend into mob rule, one that
would protect the rights of minorities, and would guarantee not only
the franchise, but the right to participate in their own self-rule.
(If you are
thinking "keep their slaves", then please be fairminded; there were a lot
of Founding Fathers who didn't appreciate their Southern slaveholding
societies bretheren, but it was a shotgun wedding they felt forced
into. Their British overseers certainly didn't mind it.)

Unfortunately, while we have a better democracy - in that the franchise
is available to all (and hopefully stays that way). But we seem to have
lost the participative part.

But there is no reason for this! Just go to a town meeting or a school
board meeting. You'll find an empty gallery; few citizens commenting on
matters. Even at the national level, most are involved in simply
voting and writing checks. Rarely does it involve precinct-level organizing.

Unfortunately, that low-level grassroots organizing *is* what makes
the difference. Not people sitting at home being engaged by watching
a lot of news and discussing with like-minded people.

The most recent significant mass movement to effect social change in
America was the civil rights movement. This movement consisted almost
_entirely_ of small-scale organizations, frequently based in churches,
working both in isolation and in concert with one another. It wasn't
accomplished by consciousness-raising, or buying ads on the television,
or getting elected representatives to support it. Perhaps as significant
as this are the efforts of religious conservatives, working across
churches, to get their own preferred school board candidates elected.

Which circles back to the Baha'i approach. Baha'is believe in small
scale grassroots organizing and community change. This is mainly because
we believe that it is individuals who must become engaged in improving
their own situation; it cannot be done for oneself by waiting for
charasmatic "leaders" to do it for them. But stepping back pragmatically,
this is the _only_ way to effect just social change. Barring this,
the other other thing to effect large-scale social change many
hunger for is armed revolution and civil war.


## Conclusion (A Half-Hearted Heritage)

I've spent some time going over many things that will help you in
your life. Hopefully some will make you rethink many of the things
you do in your life. They may even bring you happiness, though
contentment is probably better.

However, if this is where you feel you can stop and end your
studies completely, I have failed in my duty as a writer. This is
not the end; this is only a beginning. And any self-help book that
promises to revolutionize your life simply through reading it is
not really helping you.

The book is aimed at those of you who really don't want the "religion"
stuff and the "G*d" stuff so I have. Like many Buddhist popularizers,
I'm trying to show you the essense of "what Baha'i does" without
teaching you the religious core off the Baha'i Faith.

But a practitioner of meditation, if they are serious, eventually
delves into the spiritual teachings that are the underpinning of this
thought. And I'm hoping you, after reading this book, become curious
about the spiritual underpinnings of these practices.

>  will prevent man from committing evil actions and insure his spiritual

# NOTES AND APPENDICES

## NOTES

(1) Because the Baha'i Faith is known in some circles strictly for its
nonviolence, it is important to note something. It is not correct to 
think of Baha'is as pacifist, or even strictly nonviolent.

> It is true that Bahá'ís are not pacifists since we uphold the use of 
> force in the service of justice and upholding law. But we do not 
> believe that war is ever necessary and its abolition is one of the 
> essential purposes and brightest promises of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.
>       (From a letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice, 1984)

Still, being a practicing Baha'i presumes the foreswearing of violence
in our own lives. But there are caveats. Actual teachings are more balanced,
as pointed out in a 1969 letter from the Universal House of Justice to the
Canadian community:

> A hitherto untranslated Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá, however, points out 
> that in the case of attack by robbers and highwaymen, a Bahá'í should 
> not surrender himself, but should try, as far as circumstances permit, 
> to defend himself, and later on lodge a complaint with the government 
> authorities. In a letter written on behalf of the Guardian, he also 
> indicates that in an emergency when there is no legal force at hand to 
> appeal to, a Bahá'í is justified in defending his life. In another letter 
> the Guardian has further pointed out that the assault of an irresponsible 
> assailant upon a Bahá'í should be resisted by the Bahá'í, who would be 
> justified, under such circumstances, in protecting his life.

> The House of Justice does not wish at the present time to go beyond the 
> guidelines given in the above-mentioned statements. The question is 
> basically a matter of conscience, and in each case the Bahá'í involved 
> must use his judgment in determining when to stop in self-defense lest 
> his action deteriorate into retaliation.

This writer recalls other historical incidents reported of Abdu'l-Baha 
where he spoke of the need
to intervene on behalf of others being assaulted. These interventions
are NOT for punishment or vengeance, but to prevent
physical injury or further injustice.

(2) Note that I said "almost." You will engage in struggles where there
actually is conflict, where the stakes really do matter. The key is to recognize
that these are very few in number. When people say "pick your battles,"
it may be someone is telling you not to pick unwinnable fights. Instead of doing
that, perhaps it is better to
realize that there are actually very few battles to be recognized as such. 
That will leave your energy for those that must be fought, winnable or not.

(3) Baha'is may point out that consultation takes place among large bodies
in the Baha'i Faith all the time, particularly in feasts at large localities
and regional conferences.
While this is true, it is _technically_ not consultation in the sense I
am describing as a mechanism for decision making. Usually the purpose of
discussions in these large congregations is _not_ to make final decisions, 
but instead to forward 
recommendations to other smaller deliberative bodies for their
consideration and allow those deliberative bodies to get a feel for the general
opinion of the community. It is those smaller deliberative bodies that actually
engage in consultation and make the final
decision. Regarding this, here is the reference from supplimentary questions in
the Kitab-i-Aqdas:

>  If consultation among the first group of
>  people assembled endeth in disagreement, new
>  people should be added, after which persons to the
>  number of the Greatest Name (9), or fewer or more,
>  shall be chosen by lot. Whereupon the consultation
>  shall be renewed, and the outcome, whatever
>  it is, shall be obeyed. If, however, there is
>  still disagreement, the same procedure should be
>  repeated once more, and the decision of the
>  majority shall prevail.
>         (Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 136)


(4) The phrase is Alla'u'Abha, an Arabic phrase which means "God is most
Glorious." Compare that with the Arab greeting Alla'u'Akbar - God is great.
Frequently, Baha'is greet each other with "Alla'u'Abha" in meetings
where only Baha'is are present.

(5) These issues can pose problems even for dedicated Baha'is. In some cases,
some have left the Baha'i Faith due to what they find as illogical 
interpretations of the writings accepted by their fellow believers.
Unfortunately, what one finds illogical may be so simply because it conflicts
with an unstated assumption that is presumed a given based on - you guessed it -
blind interpretation. An issue amoung Baha'i academics in the late nineties
was addressed by the Baha'i supreme governing body thusly:

>  Some of the protagonists in the discussions on the Internet have implied that 
>  the only way to attain a true understanding of historical events and of the 
>  purport of the sacred and historical records of the Cause of God is through 
>  the rigid application of methods narrowly defined in a materialistic framework. 
>  They have even gone so far as to stigmatize whoever proposes a variation of 
>  these methods as wishing to obscure the truth rather than unveil it.
>
>  The House of Justice recognizes that, at the other extreme, there are Bahá'ís 
>  who, imbued by what they conceive to be loyalty to Bahá'u'lláh, cling to 
>  blind acceptance of what they understand to be a statement of the Sacred Text. 
>  This shortcoming demonstrates an equally serious failure to grasp the profundity 
>  of the Bahá'í principle of the harmony of faith and reason. The danger of 
>  such an attitude is that it exalts personal understanding of some part of 
>  the Revelation over the whole, leads to illogical and internally
>  inconsistent applications of the Sacred Text, and provides fuel to those who 
>  would mistakenly characterize loyalty to the Covenant [the Baha'i authoritative
>  sources] as "fundamentalism".
>
>       (The Universal House of Justice, 1998 Feb 08, Materialistic Elements in Academic Scholarship, p. 1)

(6) Yoda, of course.

(7) The actual language fixing the calendar days of the fast is:

> The period of fasting commences with the
> termination of the Intercalary Days, and ends
> with the Naw-Ruz Festival.

Explaining the above would require an explanation of those two feasts, and
Google will serve for the curious. If you know some Iranians, then
yes, this is tne same Naw-Ruz that Iranians celebrate as their New Year; it's
usually spelled something like Nowruz in English, and it always falls on
the first day of spring. Baha'u'llah was born in Iran and he appropriated
the Iranian holiday, which is the big commercial holiday, much like Christmas
is here in America.

(8) Critics of the Baha'i Faith, both secular and religious, may scream
about an intentional ommision by myself. Shoghi Effendi wrote of a time long in
the future where, "in the fullness of time", the Baha'i Faith becomes
the world religion of a superstate. Secular critics in particular have
pointed out this seems a lot like the notion of an Islamic caliphate.

However, this cannot be emphasized enough: Shoghi Effendi never asked
Baha'is to work for such a situation, existing Baha'i authorities have not
asked the Baha'is to do so, and the current authority (the Universal
House of Justice) has made it quite clear that even should there be
an overwhelming majority of Baha'is in a nation, that would not grant
the citizenship the right to declare the Baha'i Faith the 
official state religion. Leaving
aside the fact that having an official state religion run by the head
of state does not itself
mean a theocracy (if you don't believe me, just ask the British), Shoghi
Effendi's writings instead paint a picture of an evolution of both
the World Federation and our own Baha'i Faith that is to evolve over the
passage of an unspecified number of years.

My own opinion on the situation, and this is _my opinion only_, is that
this means a gradual inevitable evolution towards that situation over
centuries, even millenia. (If
you're interested in understanding why I believe this, read the existing
Baha'i writings discussing such concepts as God's "lesser plan" and "greater plan.")
I've heard many Baha'is conflate the two - sometimes to my frustration
when they do it in a public forum with people like you, the reader,
in attendance. Based on my reading of Shoghi Effendi's writings, that is inaccurate.
What we _are_ asked to do as Baha'is - and what I'm hoping readers will
do - is to work toward the day when the existing governments of the
world willingly work toward guarantees of freedoms, disarmament, the health
of the planet, and support any moves toward world federation.

I love the freedoms we enjoy in secular societies. And it really cannot
be stressed enough that the Baha'i Faith has been able to thrive mainly
due to the guarantees of freedom such societies provide to religious
minorities like the Baha'is. Why do I accept this notion, then? I could say
it's because I'm taking this on faith - but that would be lying. I'm
doing it because of a very pragmatic calculation:
I'm convinced that secular societies have no way of
inclulcating the virtues needed to sustain the discipline necessary
for the maintenance of such a world order. Look at what the post-Cold War
Pax Americana
has done to rehabilitate the discredited notions of nationalism and race
superiority! If secular societies can't
maintain the necessary discipline for its citizenship to avoid such
pernicious temptations, perhaps the threat of a religion
that will come in and do it for them should they fail to grow the
necessary spine will sufficiently motivate the defenders of the current
secular order.
