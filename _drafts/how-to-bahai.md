# How to Baha'i (for seculars and skeptics)

I try to write this blog for others - whoever may stumble across
it. But I have to write about what I know, which narrows things
down quite a bit. In particular, I'm interested in philosophy and
religion. That rules out a bunch of people.

I'm not writing this for me though. I'm writing this for you.
Who are you? Well, given that you're reading long-form blog posts...

There is a particular type of
personality which is, I would say... well, not un-spiritual, but
not spiritual in the sense of "in tune with the universe" and
"seeking the eternal one" and "following God in all its forms"
and _Woooooooooo_. They certainly don't enjoy sitting around with
their thoughts and deeply meditate and roam the astral plains.
Instead, they view religion and spirituality on entirely pragmatic
terms. Where religion and spirituality work, it's very selectively.
And generally it's personal - for them only.

If this clicks for you, then you're who I want to talk to. You don't
necessarily think of yourself as atheistic, but too much of
religion is alienating, and spirituality is often too new-agey and
wooooooo to speak to you. But you might be interested in things
done by religious people - meditation, yoga, retreats, etc.

If you then have any use for religion it's self-development. Or more
to the point:

Shut up and tell me what to do

You probably aren't waiting for people to give you orders - and
wouldn't like it if they did! - but you'd appreciate a path that
will make you feel better and be a
better person for others - one that will help you have better
relationships. And you aren't going to be forced on any "spirit
quests" to discover your "inner light." You figure it ought to be
simpler than that, and shouldn't require a guru.

Are you like that? I know I am.

One of the ironies is that for all the talk of each generation being
less religious than the one before it, there is more than enough
interest in the
"deeper" self-help philosophies, if you will, of Bhuddist
and Stoic thought. Such philosophies don't require you to buy into
a notion of spirit realms you can't see. What they do, instead, is
to tell you what to do in order to be a "better person." That's
in quotes because the definition of that is usually up for grabs.

I'm convinced that this skeptical outlook is reflective of a distinct 
"religious personality," and such people can
benefit from study of the Baha'i Faith _without_ buying into the
theological beliefs underpinning it. Personally I am a Baha'i, but to confess,
I frequently relate better to the skeptical sort than those who immerse
themselves entirely in the belief system, noble as it is. 
People practice meditation, yoga,
journaling and a host of other "spiritual" practices to better themselves,
all the while professing absolute disinterest in anything spiritual. If
you want to call yourself a Bhuddist, by all means learn and practice it
in its fullness, but _anyone_ can befit from that practice, Bhuddist
or not. I'm betting that if you _practice_ the Baha'i Faith, you can benefit
from it and eventually recognize some deeper truths, without forcing
yourself at any time to bury reasonable doubts about any religious path.
If I have an ulteriour motive in writing this, it's only because I hope
that some of you, upon practicing, may one day be moved to associate
yourself with the Baha'i community on a deeper level.

In my opinion, the founder of the Baha'i Faith, Baha'u'llah recognized
people like you in one of his
own writings. In a writing called 
_The Four Valleys_, he talked about four types of "spiritual wayfarers" if
you will:

>   If the wayfarers be among them that seek after **the sanctuary of the 
>   Desired One**, this plane pertaineth to the self—but the self which 
>   is intended is “the Self of God that pervadeth all His laws”. 
>   In this station the self is not rejected but beloved; it 
>   is regarded with favour and is not to be shunned. 

This is a bit obscure, but most Baha'i scholars have interpreted this as
referring to those who find God through their own dedication to self-mastery
and virtuous conduct, and dedication to His laws. Again, "just tell me
what to do." Baha'u'llah wrote this for very religiously-minded readers
(in this case, a Sufi mystic)

So for those of you who care not a whit about spirituality, I'll tell
you what I know. How to "Do Baha'i" without actually being Baha'i. Happy
Baha'ing!

## Peacefulness

This is not the most important thing, but since this is what Baha'is seem
to known uniquely for, I'll start here.

### Physical Nonviolence

Baha'is are not pacifist (1), but are known as peace-loving. Indeed, one
of the first laws Baha'u'llah declared after his mission was the forbidding
of any religious warfare. As said by the Universal House of Justice, the supreme
deliberative bond of the Baha'is: "Bahá'u'lláh has stated that is 
preferable to be killed in the path of God's good-pleasure than to 
kill, and that organized religious attack against Bahá'ís should never turn 
into any kind of warfare." (From a 1968 letter.) Physical altercation is
generally forbidden, and
there is also a general culture of nonviolence. Hunting among Baha'is is infrequent
(though not forbidden); it is not usual to find Baha'i families that won't buy
toy guns for their kids, shield them from violent media and sanction them for
getting into unnecessary fights.

There are also a few distinctive religious laws:

* Lethal arms may not be kept in the house, except in conditions of social
  unrest.

* Baha'i youth are advised to register as conscienscious objectors for
  draft registration, to allow them to be placed in non-combat positions
  should their draft be necessary.

If that were it, though, that would not be terribly distinctive. Plenty of believers
of all Faiths believe in physical nonviolence at its core. Indeed, Baha'i views
are moderate compared to some creeds. Self-defense is permitted, as is the use
of physical force to prevent injustice.

If you're looking for a life-changing code, "staying out of fights" would
certainly change the lives of some people. But I'm going to guess that
you've probably figured that out on your own. Unless you're unwisely putting
yourself in situations where violence is expected, it isn't too hard to
refrain from violence.

However, Baha'i practice focuses not on simply absention from physical violence,
but abstention on violence in any of its forms. Indeed, Baha'i practice
requires one to abstain from a number of verbally violent behaviors.

### Verbal Nonviolence

People generally are brought up to only watch out for one particularly
troublesome form of speech: calumny. Everyone is taught not to lie, but in
reality calumny is what is really sanctioned in society - lying about someone's
misdeeds to discredit someone, protect oneself or protect another. Outside of 
that, many societies consider
various sorts of "fibbing" as to be fair game. Even the Baha'i writings give
indications of times where direct truth is not the wisest course of action.

However, one lesson of the Baha'i writings is to become much more careful
with your speech. In effect, refrain from verbal violence as you would physical
violence.

Probably the most serious misuses of language in society is backbiting - the
habit of speaking ill of others who are not present. 

> O Son of Being! How couldst thou forget thine own faults and busy 
> thyself with the faults of others? Whoso doeth this is accursed of Me.

> O Son of Man! Breathe not the sins of others so long as thou art
> thyself a sinner. Shouldst thou transgress this command, accursed
> wouldst thou be, and to this I bear witness."
                       -- Baha'u'llah, _The Hidden Words_

> ...backbiting quencheth the light of the heart, and extinguisheth 
   the life of the soul.
                       -- Baha'u'llah, _The Book of Certitude_

Backbiting - discussing the faults of others not present - is a nasty habit.
And it's easy to fall into. Like the air we breathe, it's so pervasive
that it escapes notice. People think of backbiting as being nasty to a friend
behind their back, but that's simply one example. Think of half of the
commentary on social media; ridicule and scorn are commonly heaped on
all sorts of actors in society. Other ethnicities, religions, political movements,
people residing in other locations, entire populations are regularly
abused without regard to one's firsthand knowledge of the situation.
Your entire Facebook feed may consist mostly of backbiting - "viral posts"
shared among like-minded people trashing others who will never see that
slander because it won't show up in the feed.

There are situations where there really is a need to report on the
ill behavior of others. Backbiting isn't that. Most people can instinctively
tell the difference. The old advice is the best: if you can't say anything nice, 
don't say anything at all.

"It isn't backbiting if it's the truth" is the common riposte when one
wants to justify this. Perhaps _you_ think it's the truth. But
are you backbiting because it needs to be said? Or are you just attacking
a person or a group of people you don't like? Or worse yet, are you trying
to bond with someone else over shared resentments?

If you're serious about self-improvement, then the
person you focus on improving should be... yourself. Concerning ourselves
with the faults of others takes your focus off of that. If someone is causing
you problems, then a painful communication may be necessary, but that's
still under your initiative. If, however, you simply dislike something
about a person and wish to vent about it, it's better to let those feelings go.

Other less abusive forms of verbal violence are also to be avoided:

>   For the tongue is a smoldering fire, and excess of speech a deadly poison. 
>   Material fire consumeth the body, whereas the fire of the tongue devoureth 
>   both heart and soul. The force of the former lasteth but for a time, 
>   whilst the effects of the latter endureth a century.

>   Be fair in thy judgment, and guarded in thy speech.

>   Henceforward everyone should utter that which is meet and seemly, and should 
>   refrain from slander, abuse and whatever causeth sadness in men.

>   One word may be likened unto fire, another unto light, and the influence 
>   which both exert is manifest in the world. Therefore an enlightened man of 
>   wisdom should primarily speak with words as mild as milk...


Less problematic but still an issue is the coarse nature of much communication.
One may avoid ridicule and derision, yet still communicate in a harsh manner.
Think of why you're speaking. It shouldn't be for simply venting. The Baha'i
path urges moderation in all things, including tone of speech.

There is still a place for criticism. One may
say negative things about the faults of others when that person is present.
But it must be done in the right tone, particularly if you are the person
in authority. Do your words convey patience and forbearance, or impatience
and anger? Your words and attitude must convey that you're presenting 
yourself as someone who
sees a fault in someone and is hopeful that the recepient is a good person
wo will change its ways. In the case of the latter, the recipient will not
hear the criticism, but instead react to its emotional content. "This person
is angry with me." This can provoke a number of reactions, none of which
address what you'd like to do - address a fault.

If you need to modify this person's behavior, and it is unsafe or unwise to
confront this directly, and the person you are talking to is in a position
to do something about it, act like you're giving a police report. State
the actions and what you saw - nothing but the facts. You can give the
unvarnished truth without using loaded language. Tell only the objective
truth. Not only does this avoid edging into backbiting, it makes you more
credible to the listener and allows you emotionally detach from the situation.

### Media and Social Networking

If you don't want to use negative speech, I imagine you don't want
to be hearing it either. If you want to avoid using it, you can avoid picking
it up:

>   Ignoring gossip and slander is a positive, constructive and healing action 
>   helpful to the community, the gossiper and to the persons slandered.

>   The pages of swiftly-appearing newspapers are indeed the mirror of the world. 
>   They reflect the deeds and the pursuits of divers peoples and kindreds. 
>   They both reflect them and make them known...
>   However, it behoveth the writers thereof to be purged from the promptings of 
>   evil passions and desires and to be attired with the raiment of justice and 
>   equity. They should enquire into situations as much as possible and ascertain 
>   the facts, then set them down in writing.

>   Do not listen to anything that is prejudiced, for self-interest prompts 
>   men to be prejudiced. They are thoughtful only of their own will and purposes. 
>   They live and move in darkness.
>               (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 41)

Much of the media we consume hardly counts as objective reporting. Instead,
it poses as news but is really "infotainment"; opinion disguised as news 
which seeks to engage
its listeners with a stream of self-regarding mistruths, gossip about disliked
people and cultures, outright backbiting and selectively edited stories calculated
to outrage. As simply a listener, we aren't going to "fix" this problem. The
best we can do is recognize when we are being similarly targeted and refuse
to listen.

The goal is to eliminate the negative, disparaging, trash-talking content
of what poses as much of modern discourse. Don't bring that negativity into
your life. If you want to keep the peace, use peaceful language.

If everyone refrained from physical and verbal violence, everyone would
agree the world would be much better - without as many misunderstandings,
arguments, and stressful situations. But there's a problem: only your own
actions are under your control.

That being the case, you may wonder: what's the point of cleaning up my
behvior? How will my acting properly make others acting properly?

The answer: you have to control things under your control. And at the
very least, you won't hurt yourself by doing this. You will instead be
much happier.

## Unity and Community-Building

>  Illumine and hallow your hearts; let them not be profaned by the 
>  thorns of hate or the thistles of malice.
>         (Baha'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 333)

Competition has its place in society. But there is a strong case to be
made that in many Western societies, excessive competitiveness and
combativeness has become a problem. This applies both to individuals
and society as a whole.

>  In the eyes of those possessed of insight, all this conflict, contention and 
>  vainglory hath ever been, and will ever be, like unto the play and pastimes of children.
>        (Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 169)

>  A world in which naught can be perceived save strife, quarrels and corruption 
>  is bound to become the seat of the throne, the very metropolis, of Satan.
>        (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 176)

People also know that cooperation is the foundation of a civil society.
But they get this message less and less. Instead, we live in a commercial and
media environment steeped in combativeness. At work, we see environments
where raises and promotions are limited not by merit, but are scarce by
design and limited to top performers. Who is a top performer? Why, those
who out-compete the others. If you ignore these messages at work, then
you get it from the media, which seems purposely designed to create
paranoia. From story arcs that always have a villian, to partisan news
sources that create villians out of one's neighbors, to product advertisements
aimed at making people feel small and insecure if you aren't "winning," the
fight never ends. Even in self improvement - self help books, personal
coaches, even therapists are there to help you 'fight' for what you need.
Even some religious denominations try to leverage this to influency you! Many
religious "teachers" are more than happy to tell you that
your belief, feality and obedience are all duties you must assume in a
neverending War of Good and Evil against "them" (where "them," for some reason,
are people you were disinclined to like anyway. Funny, that.)

You've probably noticed - for a lot of these people, it's in _their_ self-interest
for _you_ to keep up the fight.

### Avoiding Unnecessary Conflict

Now, let's look at how the ill effects of combativeness are combated in society.
A lot of the interest around mindfulness and yoga and self-acceptance
and all that whatnot is about reducing the ego threats you feel in
society. By guiding you into stepping back.
If you're unhappy and stressed out all the time, the implication is 
that the problem is something internal to you; we can somehow tame our reactions
to a neverending stream of threats.

But that is a bit like telling us to all wear filter masks so that others
may pollute freely.
The problem is not that you are reacting to these messages badly. The problem
is you are reacting to those messages _as if they are true_. If they really
were true, you would have every reason to be stressed out and unhappy all
the time. There's a reason all these teen dystopias seem to be about children
growing up in conflict and war with each other: because it's an absolutely
miserable way to live. It seems you don't really have dystopia without needless conflict.

The solution to turning this around is to recognize that almost all of
the conflicts people try to draw you into are _absolutely fake_(2). You are not 
surrounded by enemies. There are not people out
to hate you and hurt you. Your co-workers are not out to stab you in
the back. Crime is not out of control. You do not need to get your kid into
Harvard to guarantee a future for him or her. You are not a failure if you
fail to make your first million. Need I go on?

If you take one thing away from this article it's this: life is not a game
to be played as if there are winners and losers.

If you stop seeing everything as a conflict, you will stop swimming around in
stress hormones. It is important to train yourself to not
see conflict where it doesn't exist. And not to create enemies where there are
none.

>  Do not see any enemies. Though he be your murderer, see no enemy. Look 
>  upon him with the eye of friendship. Be mindful that you do not consider 
>  him as an enemy and simply tolerate him, for that is but stratagem and 
>  hypocrisy. To consider a man your enemy and love him is hypocrisy. This 
>  is not becoming of any soul. You must behold him as a friend. You must 
>  treat him well. This is right.
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace)

Now, you will run into people in your life that seem to think everything is
a competition. Occasionally this is just insecurity and narcissism - someone 
who needs to feel like "a winner" just to belong. However, that will account
probably for most of the overly-competitive you run across; as disagreeable
as you may find these people, it's probably a fault you need to tolerate. Those
people aren't trying to ruin others; they are just a little disagreeable and 
insecure.

Far more dangerous are the tiny handful who seem to thrive not just upon 
winning, but upon _defeating_
others. If you need to deal with such people, you need to adopt very pragmatic
strategies. And if you are in a position of power or influence, you may have to take actions
to protect others against them. But your behavior must be consistent. When you do
deal with these people, you must still deal with them fairly. And you must not
believe such people are beyond help. The inclination is
to "punish" such people whenever you can, but that just gives them a fight, something
they already thrive on and you probably don't.
If the worst happens and reasonable efforts fail, you may just simply
have to avoid such people.

### Consultation

As indicated above, conflict is usually not a conflict when taken in the right
perspective. But you will have... how do we say... _differences_ with others. Lots
of them.

How these differences are handled matter a great deal to society. There are
right ways, and others, less right:

>  In France I was present at a session of the senate, but the experience 
>  was not impressive. Parliamentary procedure should have for its object 
>  the attainment of the light of truth upon questions presented and not 
>  furnish a battleground for opposition and self-opinion. Antagonism and 
>  contradiction are unfortunate and always destructive to truth. In the 
>  parliamentary meeting mentioned, altercation and useless quibbling were 
>  frequent; the result, mostly confusion and turmoil; even in one instance 
>  a physical encounter took place between two members. It was not consultation 
>  but comedy.
>                (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 72)


The Baha'i teachings around peacefulness would be very remiss if it did not
say what to do _instead_ of conflict. Fortunately, it does. Which leads to a
few more distinctive Baha'i practices.

The most distinctive is a group decision-making process known as _consultation_.
Unlike a lot of other Baha'i practices, this process evolved through the early
growth of the faith, under the guidance of the central figures of the faith.

>  Take ye counsel together in all matters, inasmuch as consultation is the lamp 
>  of guidance which leadeth the way, and is the bestower of understanding.
>                (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 168)

There is no canonical how-to on consultation; there is no "Robert's Rules of Order"
to attend to. Instead, consultation works on the following principals:

1. This being a group decision-making process that involves all participants,
the group must be small enough to allow participation by all. In my opinion, 
more than a dozen people
starts to become unworkable. In Baha'i deliberative bodies, 9 is the usual number. (3)
While we do this because of the Baha'i writings, this idea has come up in business
as well, with the concept of a "two pizza team," the idea being that if you can't
feed the team with two pizzas, it's too big to keep everyone on the same page.

2. All participants must respect one another and committ themselves to the
common goal of finding a truthful outcome Partisanship has no place in 
consultations, and those consulting must set
aside all personal feelings of loyalty to tribe and group membership or association.
Baha'is are told that participants must feel absolute love and fellowship for
one another. While this may not be possible for your group, it is doubtful consultation
will produce an outcome everyone will hold to if members of the group cannot trust
and respect one another.

3. The goal of consultation is the unfettered search for truth. Statements must be 
made in a
dispassionate way and refer to the facts at hand. Opinions and strong emotional
statements obscure the truth, intentionally or not. The strenght of one's personal
feelings may be conveyed, but may not have bearing on the rightness or wrongness
of any idea.

>  He who expresses an opinion should not voice it as correct and right but set 
>  it forth as a contribution to the consensus of opinion,
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 72)

>  Man should weigh his opinions with the utmost serenity, calmness and composure.
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 72)

4. Speakers should use tact, wisdom, and speak in moderation. However, this
does not imply self-censorship. All ideas must be offered. Good intentions must
be presumed of all partiipants, and one should not take offense when none is
intended.

5. All ideas are the property of the group. Once uttered, it does not make sense
to refer to something as belonging to a particular person. If ratified, it is the
group as a whole that promotes the idea.

6. Minutes may be necessary for transparency - particular if the group is making
decisions for a larger group. However, specifics of the details recorded are for the group
as a whole to decide. When it comes to individual votes, anonymity must be preserved
in the case of a majority vote.
Points may be taken down without reference to speakers or supporters of various
position, as members must be able to speak freely. In many cases, confidentiality is
necessy for personal safety; it may even be necessary to either record
these separately so as to keep such notes in confidence.

>  Indeed, it has ever been the cherished desire of our Master, 'Abdu'l-Bahá, that 
>  the friends in their councils, local as well as national, should by their 
>  candor, their honesty of purpose, their singleness of mind, and the thoroughness 
>  of their discussions, achieve unanimity in all things.
>             (Shoghi Effendi, Baha'i Administration, p. 80)


7. A strong effort is made to come to a consensus, All members must agree on the
proposal for it to move forward. Unfortunately, a deadlock may occur. If there
are several attempts to break a deadlock and they fail, a majority vote may be
necessary to produce a final decision.
This prevents a small number of individuals who support the status quo from
blocking all change.

8. Once a decision is made, it must be supported by all members, whether or not
they agreed with the proposal. This avoids "sandbagging" by members who are unhappy
with a decision. As part of this, one may not indicate that they did not originally
support the idea; one's personal views do not matter. One is speaking for the
whole once a matter is decided.

The goal of this is to ensure that the group is in unity around a particular
plan of action. The goal is NOT to reach a final decision, now and for the end
of time. By taking a unified action and watching results, it will the be much
easier to determine whether or not the right action was decided upon. In this
matter, even large mistakes by the group may be quickly corrected.

### Non-Partisanship and Political Non-Alignment

One may look at the requirements for consultation and admire this as a
decision-making process for business and government. For government especially
comes the question: what then of the place for political parties of common 
interest? Cannot they organize to best represent their interest? Should they
not organize to defend views they consider right?

The Baha'i answer to this is clear: they can not and should not.

The reason is evident as is spelled out in the purpose of decision making.
The purpose is to serve _the group as a whole_. Now: if there was any political
party that represented both party members and non-party members, I haven't
heard of such an entity. The purpose of a political party is PARTisan; it
represents a PART of a whole, not the whole.

Since you, gentle reader, are probably not a Baha'i, you have no obligation
to change your behavior. However, the law for Baha'is (my understanding) 
is thus:

    One cannot belong to a political party. One cannot identify with a
    political party. One cannot even publicly take sides in
    political controversies of a partisan nature.

This may seem somewhat extreme. Most people registered to a political party
do so only for the convenience of voting in a primary. In states like New York,
party affiliation is _required_ to vote in a primary. Nevertheless, for Baha'is the only
way to avoid partisanship is to avoid aligning oneself with a party. Entirely.

This is particularly the case in today's environment. Perhaps sometime
in the mythic bipartisan past, there was broad agreement across the parties
on All Things American, the parties respected the members of one another,
and all worked toward a common solution. I doubt it. And in any case, this
"bipartisanship" mostly worked by entirely avoid the issue of civil rights
(more on that later).

But now, the major factor of partisan affiliation is "negative partisanship";
that is, one affiliates with a party as a show of hatred for members of the
other party. In such a case, it is even more important to avoid such partisanship.

Aside from this, the Baha'i writings say little. I will, however, add two
very compelling problems that result when you engage in partisan conduct.

_Emotional Imblance_: Most people who engage in partisan politics _feel_
extremely strongly about something. And unfortunate as it is, many times
these feelings aren't based on something imaginary. There really are problems
that could be solved easily, were there not intransigent opposition by
a significant minority of the population.

Unfortunately for you, you do not know with any certainty that problems you
are hung up on are _actually problems_. And in any event, such things are
not under your control. If you are driven by such frustrations as to long
for gas chambers of your opponents, you are no longer in a position where
you are thinking clearly.
Inevitably, such contempt for others leaks out into words and action, resulting
in backbiting and acts of minor agression. Slowly, one becomes a less
social person and unhappy. In the worst case, one becomes antisocial and
posts unbalanced rants from the computer in the basement.

Does that sound like a prescription for happiness? Not on your life.

_Political Hobbyism_: Another problem I have to credit to a writer (TODO)
that puts his finger on a real problem. People confuse "being informed"
or "being concerned" or "arguing with strangers on the internet" as being
politically active.

Certainly, when one does that, one is engaging in partisan behavior. But
is it really political?

If someone is "engaged" in this manner, then the only course of action one
has is _voting_. Note that this is the same course of action available to
someone who is blissfuly ignorant of the events of the day, wanders
into the voting booth, and chooses his or her candidate based on who looked more
"leadership-py" in their campaign ads.

This engagement is not political activism. It is political hobbyism. Actually
being political requires working with others to improve how government works
for them. Being involved in town meetings, running for nonpartisan offices,
being engaged in organizations for social change (and I don't mean just cutting
a check). If you don't have the time to do that, then you probably could make
your life a lot better by cutting back your reading in the name of being
"engaged".

Before I was Baha'i I was rather "engaged" myself. The result of all my
activities is probably that I was a less agreeable person to be around. By detaching
myself from these hobbies, I gained a better sense of control of my life,
and the time to read for fun again.

### Small Scale Change

What does that mean? It means all actual effective change is going to come
at the small scale.

To improve any situation, the place to start is _locally_. It feels important to
be engaged in "the big issues." It's also woefully ineffective. You can show up
in the polling both; you can call your representative. That's about it.

If you want to make change locally, that's something you can do something about.
You can organize people at the neighborhood, and solve problems at that level.
The more focused and local, the better. If you wish to effect national change,
the idea is still the same - many people speaking with one voice will gain a
hearing that scattered individuals would not.
Still, it is not sufficient for people to vote for faraway representatives to take
actions to then be imposed top-down on the people voted for. Instead, decisions
must be taken by the very people who are acted upon by those decisions.

Members of the Baha'i Faith are encouraged to "think small" when it comes
to projects of social improvement:

- Survey your local community to see what resources you have at hand, both
human and otherwise.

- Once done, find out what the local needs are and how those resources can
be applied.

- Start small pilot projects, eventually forming an organization of social
or economic change.

Key to this, as you might guess, is consultation, using the process mentioned
earlier.

## Psychic Self-Care

OK, so earlier I promised you there would be no spiritual wooooooo, no prayers
to some nature God/Goddes or focusing on your chakras. None of that devotional
nonsense or boring prayer for you, right?

But on the other hand, I have to tell you how to apply Baha'i teachings to
your life, right?

So I can't skip over this. In the Baha'i Faith, prayer and meditation is
_important_. Some Baha'is would say this is indeed _the_ most important,
and would regard everything else I'm writing about as extraneous..

I'm on the other end of the spectrum. If given a choice between silent
contemplation and an action that would make a difference, I'd choose an action.
(Although right now, working on a blog post, I suspect I may be doing neither).
But yet, I still pray and meditate, though perhaps to a lesser extent than many
of my fellow believers.

In the Baha'i Faith, "prayer and meditation" is a rather broad concept.
I know Baha'is who still pray in the "low Protestant" sense of the word,
talking to God and asking for things and holding hands with their
neighbor. But many others do different things. For instance, Baha'is have a
tradition of chanting written prayers and writings, similar to the Islamic
tradition. But those of us with less beautiful voices will just read
prayers from the Baha'i writings, silently or aloud, and frequently from
memory. How much is up to individual believers, though there is an
obligatory prayer said once a day in a few different forms.

Why do I do it, when I go around telling people "I don't believe in
magic?" Is it just because I'm supposed to? Isn't prayer just you asking
G*d for stuff? Something less civilized people do instead of funding
laws to prevent bad stuff from happening? In the Baha'i Faith, it is
nothing of the sort.

Here's the short form of the obligatory prayers:

>  I bear witness, O my God, that Thou hast created me to know the
>  and worship Thee. I testify at this moment to my powerlessness and
>  to Thy might, to my poverty and to Thy wealth. There is no other
>  God but Thee, the help in peril, the self-subsisting.

And here's another one, much shorter than usual, which is usually used
in stressful situations instead of repeating, say, "serenity now":

>  Is there any remover of difficulties save God? Say, praise be
>  God! He is God, all are his servants and all abide by his bidding.

Now look at both these prayers. What don't you see? Are you asking God
for something? Talking to him like he's your buddy? Do you think God
even cares if you're saying these or not? In fact, he does not, and
that's _entirely the point_. _You_ are saying these. These are messages
for you. Now, most Baha'is will tell you these prayers have "spiritual
potency" of one form or another, but even if you refuse to believe
in "spirit," you can see the effect if you say these and pay attention.

I can't interpret what these prayers mean or do, but I can tell you
what they mean to me. The obligatory prayer is a strong reminder to
be humble. The second prayer is a reminder that you will encounter
difficulties that are not under your control, and that's life. You can't
say these prayers and mean them without thinking about if your life
is in conformity with these lessons.

Now supposing you don't believe in this G*d stuff. There are many Baha'i
prayers but virtually all of them invoke G*d in some form. I could sit
here and try to explain what Baha'is believe about God - how He himself
is an unknowable essense which we cannot in any way directly communicate
with, how we use the pronoun He becuase of limitations of English grammar
only ('It' would imply nonintelligence, 'They' would imply multiplicity
and polythesim). But I suspect any G*d at allis too much of an ask for
some of you.

In that case, I do think it's important to at the very least, sit still
with your thoughts a few minutes every day, and self-reflect on the
type of person you are regularly. The Baha'i writings have this piece of
advice:

>  O SON OF BEING!
>  Bring thyself to account each day ere thou art summoned to a reckoning; 
>  for death, unheralded, shall come upon thee and thou shalt be called 
>  to give account for thy deeds.
>          (Baha'u'llah, The Arabic Hidden Words #31)

If you want to become a better person (and if you don't, why are you
reading this?), you'll need to take into account the fact you have
only one life, and you'll need to think every day on how to best
make use of it. 

That sounds like a heavy thought, but if you've done journaling or a
daily diary that's a start. Set aside a short time near the end of
the day to sit with your thoughts and review the sort of person
you've been that day. If you can't stand the thought of prayers
or meditating, that's a start.

As far as meditating, there are as many techniques as there are people.
Many Baha'is meditate upon the Baha'i writings, no surprise there, but
there are those that use meditation as a special "quiet time," similar
to Quaker and Buddhist practices. Reading certain sorts of philosophy or
even poetry can serve as a meditation. One can even use a mantra; the Baha'i
writings direct believers to say a certain phrase 95 times each day(4),
which serves as a guided metidation. All of these forms seek the same
thing - to cultivate a "pure" mind for reflection and unclouded thought.
Personally, I bristle at the commercialized version of this, "mindfulness," 
which is promoted as some sort of life hack to eliminate stress. (The
key to getting rid of stress is to eliminate stressors. For some reason,
work HR deparments aren't terribly fond of that one). But returning to
my theme:meditation, like the daily self review, is an important way to
refocus yourself. Most Baha'is would feel life without prayer and
meditation unthinkable.

Note that this is not therapy or "self care." The purpose is not
to reduce stress, whatever the stressors are. The purpose is to
work on yourself. If you cannot stand the thought of conversing with
God, the least you can do is let your psyche converse with yourself.

## Logic

One of the key points in the Baha'i Faith, odd as it seems, is logic.
This may surpise many - even those who are Baha'is. But Baha'is
definitely have a respect for science and logic that sets them apart
from other denominations. This is not to say that individual Baha'is
do not pose their own theories of the worlds of the spirit and vent all
sorts of untestable theories. The difference is Baha'is will always
indicate these are their _own individual thoughts_, and will not expect
the assent of others.

Where they do expect assent is in recognition of logical thought and science.
But doing just that would be unremarkable for any religious
organization. All religions claim their beliefs are eminintly logical, and
of course their believers use logic. And all say they are in conformity
with "science" (though many will insist on defining science in a way that
is compatibile with their beliefs).

Much of the Baha'i writings in and around reasoning are directed toward
audiences which, compared to this readership, are far more religious.
So much of what came in for criticism was existing religious thought,
steeped as it was in "blind imitation" of religious practices and
ancestral forms. But there are other more human tendencies that come under
criticism as illogical.

The fact is, logic is a skill that is often not applied due to certain
failures of thinking. Many of us know about cognitive biases - how people
fall prey to certain misbeliefs because of the way our brain works. However,
more problematic are often failings which are almost moral in nature; a
desire to fool or lie to oneself to avoid recognizing unflattering truths
about ourselfs or cherished beliefs we may hold dear, even while recognizing
on some level its wrongness.

The first one is prejudice, which is even seen by Abdu'l-Baha as the primary
cause of war:

>  And the breeding-ground of all these tragedies is prejudice: prejudice 
>  of race and nation, of religion, of political opinion; and the root 
>  cause of prejudice is blind imitation of the past -- imitation in religion, 
>  in racial attitudes, in national bias, in politics. So long as this 
>  aping of the past persisteth, just so long will the foundations of the 
>  social order be blown to the four winds, just so long will humanity 
>  be continually exposed to direst peril.
>        (Abdu'l-Baha, Selections from the Writings of Abdu'l-Baha, p. 247)

Prejudice is frequently the result of receiving unquestioned assumptions about
"the way things are"; generally, unthinking reflection of beliefs passed down
from our parents, our peer groups, the media we consume. The writings refer
to this as "blind imitation," and identify it as the main reason for unnecessary
contention in the world. In many cases, blind imitation is the cause of
religious dogmatism (surprise!) (ok, maybe not).

>  At the same time the basic foundation of the religion of God, which was 
>  ever the principle of love, unity and the fellowship of humanity, has 
>  been forsaken and cast aside, each religious system holding tenaciously 
>  to imitations of ancestral forms as the supreme essential. Therefore, 
>  hatred and hostility have appeared in the world instead of the divine 
>  fruitage of unity and love.
>      (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 442)

But "tribe membership" and nationalism this can just as easily lead to other 
bigotries caused by blind imitation.

>  The nations and religions are steeped in blind and bigoted imitations. A 
>  man is a Jew because his father was a Jew. The Muslim follows implicitly 
>  the footsteps of his ancestors in belief and observance. The Buddhist is 
>  true to his heredity as a Buddhist. That is to say, they profess religious belief 
>  blindly and without investigation, making unity and agreement impossible.
>      (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 140)

The solution to this is _independent investigation of reality_. Which is to say,
not a corrosive cynicism which beliefs nothing, but a willingness to apply a
healthy skepticism to received beliefs, and a healthy questioning and curious
attitude toward life.

>   `O My Brother, journey upon these planes in the spirit of search, not in blind imitation.
>            (Baha'u'llah, The Seven Valleys, p. 23)

>   There have issued, from His [Baha'u'llah's] mighty Pen, various teachings for 
>   the prevention of war, and these have been scattered far and wide.
>
>   The first is the independent investigation of truth; for blind imitation of 
>   the past will stunt the mind. But once every soul inquireth into truth, society 
>   will be freed from the darkness of continually repeating the past.
>             (Abdu'l-Baha, Selections from the Writings of Abdu'l-Baha, p. 248)


Curiousity and learning are to be praised, and superstition avoided. Certain
parts of American society have become increasingly opposed to higher learning, but
there is absolutely no justification
for this outlook within the Baha'i Faith. Baha'i thought is to desire learning
for its own sake:

>  Shoghi Effendi [the sole Baha'i authority of the early- and mid-20th century]
>  has for years urged the Bahá'ís (who asked his advice, and in general also) 
>  to study history, economics, sociology, etc., in order to be au courant with 
>  all the progressive movements and thoughts being put forth today, and so 
>  that they could correlate these to the Bahá'í teachings. What he wants the 
>  Bahá'ís to do is to study more, not to study less. The more general knowledge, 
>  scientific and otherwise, they possess, the better.
>         (The Universal House of Justice, 1997 Aug 13, Science and Religion, p. 3)

The Baha'i community in Iran has been subjugated for years. One of the most persistent
punishments the government has place on the Baha'i community is to bar them from
enrollment in universities. The reason they do this is twofold. First, in the years
prior to the Iranian revolution, Baha'is attended universities in far greater numbers
than the proportions of the population. While many Iranians are uncomfortable with
the treatment of the Baha'i community by their government, they are also aware that
there is a persistent shortage of slots for univerity enrollment in Iran. Second,
they are aware that higher learning was something treasured by Baha'is, and the fact
that this may be seen as particularly cruel to the community gives the Iranian
authorities all the more reason to do it.

Given this background, most Baha'is would view avoidance of higher education as
sheer folly. It is true that a strict, regimented university degree is not for
all, or perhaps even the majority. But it is also true that a zeal for learning and
curiousity throughout one's life is key to developing both one's character and
capabilities.

Superstition, on the other hand, does the opposite.

>  Suffer not thyself to become the instrument for the dissemination of new superstitions
>      (Baha'u'llah, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 164)

>  People for the most part delight in superstitions. They regard a single drop of 
>  the sea of delusion as preferable to an ocean of certitude.
>       (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 58)

You, gentle reader, are of course immune to superstition, and you and I can both
imagine looking down our nose at the non-numerically inclined, those that believe
in lucky sneakers, picking lucky lotto numbers, passing on tales of magical
pilgramage sites, and happily reading _The DaVinci Code_ sequels as if they were
nonfiction.

But we may have other cherished beliefs - the "dust of acquired knowldge." Things like
our own pet theories about the way the world works. Such beliefs need not have been
acquired from others through blind imitation; they may simply be an unhappy side-effect
of painful events in our past. Or they may be picked up unconsciously, like the
internal beliefs that interpret everything as a conflict that I pointed out early
in the book. It does not need to be an easily-ridiculed superstion to be false.

Finally, I'd like to close this with two sources of error pointed out by the Baha'i
faith that often escape attention, even by the most intelligent and sound of thinkers.

One is "Attachment":

>  It is difficult for someone to see a truth when his paycheck is dependent
>  upon not seeing it.
>          Upton Sinclair

>  [In London] ...a Canon of the Anglican Church met him [Abdu'l-Baha] at breakfast. 
>  The conversation turned on the reluctance of the rich to part with their 
>  possessions, 'Abdu'l-Bahá, quoting the saying of Jesus, "How hardly shall 
>  they that have riches enter into the Kingdom of Heaven." He remarked that only 
>  when the true seeker finds that attachments to the material are keeping him from 
>  his spiritual heritage, will he gladly enter the way of renunciation.
>                (Abdu'l-Baha, Abdu'l-Baha in London, p. 83)

The word "attachment" is usually used Baha'i beliefs in the sense of attachment
to our own material wealth. Baha'is are repeatedly told to practice the opposite;
detachment. That is, to do what is right and noble, regardless of consequence for
ourselves.

A Baha'i teacher once told me Baha'u'llah specified there were three great
attachments to be avoided: attachment to material things, attachment to rank,
and attachment to "the Kingdom of Names". I haven't been able to trace the source,
but in this context, "attachment to the Kingdom of Names" refers to one who
prides himself on publicly being the embodiment of a virtue; for example, one
who gives publicly strictly to be seen as generous. Perhaps this might be more
simply put as "attachment to having others and yourself think well of oneself".
Whenever dealing with these, these attachments are powerful impediments to our
logic. With attachment, motivated reasoning will bend any argument in service
to its ulterior motives.

And finally, the most shocking and perhaps worst underlying belief.
"The Belief that We are Right"

## Self-Mastery

It's a common problem Baha'is run into when explaining their beliefs. When people
ask about Baha'i beliefs they want to know:

    OK, what are the laws? What do I have to give up?

Most people, when asked in this manner about their religion, tend to bristle.
They think "that's not the point," but generally don't have a rejoinder that
will fit on a bumper sticker. My guess is that when religious people hear
this question, they think, somewhat cynically, that this is not a good faith
question, but just a parlor trick intended to produce an answer that can
then be used to reject one's own religion.

(Also, if one is a Christian, one is aware of the writings of a certain
Jewish carpenter who had some quite severe words about people who strictly
followed religious laws but did nothing else of value. So the emphasis on
the laws seem quite misplaced when the founder of these religious laws
themselves placed so much emphasis on many other things.)

So I'm going to do something counterintuitive. What, you say you're not
a Baha'i? Congratulations, the religious laws binding on you are

**NONE WHATSOEVER**

And as for my advice to you? Follow NONE of them!

But... (and you're waiting for the catch, aren't you).

Part of being a better person is about self-mastery and self discipline.
You'll have to do those, laws or no laws.

When New Year's rolls around, what's the one thing everyone picks as
a resolution? "Try to be a better person." Or something like that. But
as one famous philosopher once said (6), "There is no try, only do."

So self-mastry is really the art of doing what is required to convert
'try' into 'do'. Part of self-mastery is practical skills. Things
like proper diet, study, time management, punctuality, and a number of
things all fold into that, but these are hardly unique to Baha'i; indeed,
they're hardly religious.

So there's another element of self-mastery which is important, and that's
involving management or elimination of various 'temptations.' Now,
unfortunately, 'temptations' is a word most often used in ad copy for
deserts and various fat-free treats, but let's break down what it is - something
that is compelling enough to make you do what you don't want to do.
What does the Baha'i Faith say about managing those? Or rather, what
would a 'typical Baha'i' do that you might benefit from?


### Self-Indulgence

Despair, both here and hereafter, is all you will gain from self-indulgence; abomination and misery are all you will harvest from fanaticism, from believing the foolish and the mindless.

(1) It is not correct to think of Baha'is as pacifist, or even strictly
nonviolent.

> It is true that Bahá'ís are not pacifists since we uphold the use of 
> force in the service of justice and upholding law. But we do not 
> believe that war is ever necessary and its abolition is one of the 
> essential purposes and brightest promises of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.
>       (From a letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice, 1984)

In our own lives, however, it presumes the foreswearing of violence
in our own lives. But there are caveats. Actual teachings are more balanced,
as pointed out in a 1969 letter from the Universal House of Justice to the
Canadian community:

> A hitherto untranslated Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá, however, points out 
> that in the case of attack by robbers and highwaymen, a Bahá'í should 
> not surrender himself, but should try, as far as circumstances permit, 
> to defend himself, and later on lodge a complaint with the government 
> authorities. In a letter written on behalf of the Guardian, he also 
> indicates that in an emergency when there is no legal force at hand to 
> appeal to, a Bahá'í is justified in defending his life. In another letter 
> the Guardian has further pointed out that the assault of an irresponsible 
> assailant upon a Bahá'í should be resisted by the Bahá'í, who would be 
> justified, under such circumstances, in protecting his life.

> The House of Justice does not wish at the present time to go beyond the 
> guidelines given in the above-mentioned statements. The question is 
> basically a matter of conscience, and in each case the Bahá'í involved 
> must use his judgment in determining when to stop in self-defense lest 
> his action deteriorate into retaliation.

This writer recalls other historical incidents reported of Abdu'l-Baha 
where he spoke of the need
to intervene on behalf of others being assaulted. This was not for
punishment or vengeance, but to prevent
physical injury or further injustice.

(2) Note that I said "almost." You will engage in struggles where there
actuall is conflict, where it really does matter. The key is to recognize
that these are very few in number. When people say "pick your battles,"
it's someone telling you not to pick unwinnable fights. Instead, perhaps
realize that there are actually very few battles to be recognized as such. 

(3) Baha'is may point out that consultation takes place among large bodies
in the Baha'i Faith all the time, particularly in feasts at large localities
and regional conferences.
While this is true, it is _technically_ not consultation in the sense I
am describing as a mechanism for decision making. The purpose of
discussions in these large congregations is _not_ to make final decisions, 
but instead to forward 
recommendations to other smaller deliberative bodies for their
consideration and allow those deliberative bodies to get a feel for the general
opinion of the community. It is those smaller deliberative bodies that actually
engage in consultation and make the final
decision. Regarding this, here is the reference from supplimentary questions in
the Kitab-i-Aqdas:

>  If consultation among the first group of
>  people assembled endeth in disagreement, new
>  people should be added, after which persons to the
>  number of the Greatest Name (9), or fewer or more,
>  shall be chosen by lot. Whereupon the consultation
>  shall be renewed, and the outcome, whatever
>  it is, shall be obeyed. If, however, there is
>  still disagreement, the same procedure should be
>  repeated once more, and the decision of the
>  majority shall prevail.
>         (Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 136)


(4) The phrase is Alla'u'Abha, an Arabic phrase which means "God is most
Glorious." Compare that with the Arab greeting Alla'u'Akbar - God is great.
Sometimes Baha'is even greet each other with Alla'u'Abha in meetings
where only Baha'is are present.

(5) These issues can pose problems even for dedicated Baha'is. In some cases,
some have left the Baha'i Faith due to what they find as illogical interpretations.
Unfortunately, what one finds illogical may be so simply because it conflicts
with an unstated assumption that is presumed a given based on - you guessed it -
blind interpretation. An issue amoung Baha'i academics in the late nineties
was addressed by the Baha'i supreme governing body thusly:

>  Some of the protagonists in the discussions on the Internet have implied that 
>  the only way to attain a true understanding of historical events and of the 
>  purport of the sacred and historical records of the Cause of God is through 
>  the rigid application of methods narrowly defined in a materialistic framework. 
>  They have even gone so far as to stigmatize whoever proposes a variation of 
>  these methods as wishing to obscure the truth rather than unveil it.
>
>  The House of Justice recognizes that, at the other extreme, there are Bahá'ís 
>  who, imbued by what they conceive to be loyalty to Bahá'u'lláh, cling to 
>  blind acceptance of what they understand to be a statement of the Sacred Text. 
>  This shortcoming demonstrates an equally serious failure to grasp the profundity 
>  of the Bahá'í principle of the harmony of faith and reason. The danger of 
>  such an attitude is that it exalts personal understanding of some part of 
>  the Revelation over the whole, leads to illogical and internally
>  inconsistent applications of the Sacred Text, and provides fuel to those who 
>  would mistakenly characterize loyalty to the Covenant [the Baha'i authoritative
>  sources] as "fundamentalism".
>
>       (The Universal House of Justice, 1998 Feb 08, Materialistic Elements in Academic Scholarship, p. 1)
