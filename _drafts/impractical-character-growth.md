# An Impractical Method for Developing Virtue

One problem I indicated with improving one's virtue is that methods
for doing so are ineffective. Not simply impractical, but
ineffective. Being a manly man myself, when I think of character
building, the most common method I think of is something of a boot
camp - the whole "we'll break you down to build you back up again."
This sort of character-building-by-hazing is pretty common, but I am
skeptical it results in anything other than a temporary adrenalin
high. And hazing, in particular, has rather nasty side-effects -
convincing former participants that it was good for them, and
therefore, acceptable to force upon others.

Spiritual paths have their own path to virtue. In many cases, it is
not spelled out as such - it may, for instance, be spelled out as a
path to enlightenment or salvation. However, given the nature of
religious belief, this is generally assumed to be the same. While
there are fundamentalist denominations of every sort that separate the
elect from the heathen based on something other than virtue,
e.g. adherence to doctrine or ethnic membership, even in those cases
the believers are assumed to be more virtuous than nonbelievers. In
any event, some sort of path is spelled out for the believers.

However that may be, most believers carry out devotional acts with at
least an implicit faith that it will help them in more virtuous
conduct. Even those who do nothing more than "pray for things" will
frequently pray for more virtuous conduct from themselves. And other
faiths make this more explicit; both Buddhism's meditation and the
Hindu yogi practices are explicitly meant to improve one's virtue by
limiting passions and focusing one's thought

In the Baha'i Faith this coupling between religious laws and virtues
is purposely explicit. Baha'is believe that this life is a preparation
for the next life, a purely "spiritual" life. Our happiness in the
next life is dependent entirely on the cultivation of virtues; one who
has well-developed virtues and character will find
happiness. Conversely, someone who is venal and materialistic will
miserable in such a life. Given that Baha'is believe that virtue is
necessary, Baha'i laws and practices are recommended specifically
because of their ability to cultivate virtue.

There are many. Even if you haven't heard of The Baha'i Faith, all of
these will sound familiar. While their numbers and duration is not
onerous, it is notable how many there are.

   a. Obligatory prayer. Baha'is are required to do one of three
   prayers each day. The form varies, but obligatory time committments
   are short, no more than 10 minutes a day. Baha'is typically read
   prayers and meditations written by the central figures; while there
   are some healing prayers, the bulk of are written so as to focus
   one's thoughts rightly and remind the reader of virtuous conduct.
   
   b. Repetition of a "mantra-like" phrase ('Allau-u-Abhah') 95 times;
   again, this takes just a few minutes.
   
   c. Requirements to account one's wealth and ensure at least a
   minimum percentage is given to the church and other
   charities. Notably, the largest levy exempts one's "necessary
   expenses," meaning a practicing Baha'i must, as a matter of course,
   view all consumption in terms of whether it is necessary or not. 
   
   d. An injunction to read the writings "in the morning and in the
   night." In practice, this means dedicating a minute or two twice a
   day to some sort of devotional reading from the Baha'i Writings or
   other religious scriptures (e.g. Koran, Bible, etc.)

   e. A once-a-year 19-day religious fast. While there is no explicit reason
   given for this fast, it is acknowledged that the purpose is to
   allow practice of self-restraint.

  f. End-of-day review of once's deeds (c.f. Hidden Words: "Bring
  thyself to account each day ere thou art summoned to a
  reckoning;"). While this is not regarded as a Baha'i Law, I've known a
  fair number of people who incorporate that into their life, through
  either end-of-day meditation or by journaling.

  g. An obligation to "teach the faith." Bahai's are frequently
  reminded that this is not the same as recruitment. Many
  psychologists have noted that evangelical churches focus on
  evangelism because it steadies believers, noting that sects dealing
  with discomfited prophecy often react by increasing
  evangelism. However, study of Baha'i writings indicate this has a
  different focus, one requiring ongoing cultivation of virtue:
  
    * A necessity to study the writings well enough to be confident of
    one's knowledge that one can truthfully explain it to others.
    
    * The ability to be able to discuss Baha'i beliefs with others in a
    manner that other's will find agreeable;
    
    * The necessity of regarding "teaching" as being a process of
    assisting others in their spiritual growth, rather than just ending
    the minute the join "the church."

  h. There are also numerous Baha'i laws, outlined in what is regarded
  as the holiest book, _The Kitab-i-Aqdas_ (the literal translation of
  which is "The Most Holy Book"). While the laws are varied, the bulk
  of it consists of numerous exhortations to virtuous conduct: honesty
  and scrupulousness in all matters, cleanliness, avoidance of
  gambling and illicit substances, avoidance of gossip and
  backbiting. For Baha'is, the summary of these laws, in "The Synopsis
  and Codification of The Kitab-i-Aqdas," is considered binding.

Taken together, this forms a very long list. This is especially the
case when compared to the "Buddhism-lite" popular in the West, which
generally focuses on just one thing: meditation and practice of
mindfulness. Given the Western focus on individualism, the centrality
of laws of virtuous conduct has probably been offputting to many who
would consider themselves "spiritual but not religious." However, a
review of this list is that these are not onerous and not pose a
significant time committment. The recommended times for prayers and
readings are probably on the order of 15-20 minutes a day - probably
less than someone who picks up a yoga practice hoping to focus on
mindfulness.

----------------------

There are many Baha'is who insist that given that such practices are
prescribed, they are _necessary and sufficient_ for character
growth. In other words, given that Baha'u'llah (the founder of the
Baha'i Faith) carries for the message "for this day and age," his
message must necessarily be complete. Any suggested "improvement" on
this is something short of blasphemy. Application of science is
inappropriate, except to show scientifically that this is an ideal,
complete path for character development. Let's just call this a
"maximalist" outlook, in that it regards this as a mathematical
optimal _for everyone_.

It is possible you are one of these. If you are, be warned. I'm not
writing a message of self-congratulations to my fellow believers.  My
possibly blasphemous opinion is that for _some_ people, this may not
be the case. It is necessary. If you are not Baha'i, I think something
of a similar nature is necessary. But even if you are Baha'i, it may
not be _sufficient_.

--------------

Let us look at the list of virtues given. There are 52 virtues given -
and note these are recognized by all religions, including (and perhaps
especially) The Baha'i Faith. There are a handful of virtues which
are going to be _directly_ improved by the practices above:

detachment
faithfulness
reverence
self-discipline

For a practicing Baha'i, it is possible to cultivate all virtues by
assiduous focus - prayer, study of the writings, meditation and a
daily review of one's actions are all that is needed. However, it is
not automatic. It is possible to carry out the spiritual practices in
a rote manner - saying prayers without thinking, practicing the fast
without reflection and so on.

Thus it has always been - there have
always been believers who assiduously practiced their faith, yet have
been prone to poor character and lack of virtuous conduct. One may
rightly ask just how effective religious practices are given this
fact.

The problem, however, is compared to what other practices are
available. It isn't as if one can say there are better paths to
self-development. Secular alternatives like psychological therapy are
effective, but like a religious path, it isn't a panacea - it requires
the same time committment and self-resolve that religious paths
require. Reading philosophy and reflecting may be recommended by many
of a secular persuasion - but to someone practicing religion, this
looks an awful lot like their own current practice!

No, the problem is that character growth is hard. The fact we have a
spiritual path does not make it easy, and it doesn't make it
guaranteed.

----------------------

Given all the above caveats, what can we find out?

Well, let's suppose we agree that in order to live virtuously, you
need to a good moral code - even if you just write down your own and
want to stick to it. The above outlines some sort of self-improvement
schedule:

MORNING
5 minutes reflection and reading

NOON/AFTERNOON
10 minutes meditation or prayer

EVENING
5 minutes reflection and reading
10 minutes reflection on the prior day

WEEKLY (or as needed)
Review of expenses

YEARLY
Fast of meaningful duration

This doesn't seem like a lot. It isn't onerous. It certainly should do
_something_. If one is very disciplined about it, it is going to add
up - particularly if you are very focused on making the items work.

At this point, there is only one thing. The improvement is global in
nature. You aren't going to see it. In such a case, the temptation is
to stop doing it. It won't make enough of a difference in the
day-to-day to succeed. This will encourage backsliding.

Imagine, if you will, that you take up a new diet and exercise
regime. The diet itself isn't bad, but it does require that you give
up certain things you really like, and essentially give up a way of
eating that you'd grown to enjoy. The exercise regime is also light; a
half-hour three times a week.

The question: will you stick to it?

In fact, there's a good chance you may not. The expenditure of effort
is reasonable - indeed, you should be congratulated on picking modest,
realistic goals you're liable to stick with over time. The problem is
that you don't see anything measurable over the medium term. In the
short term, you'll notice a slight improvement - drop a few pounds,
perhaps, feel a little better. But as the weeks pile on, you won't see
any dramatic improvement. And your tendency will be to backslide.

This is the problem anyone has with staying motivated with a long term
plan. You see the end goal, stretching out years in front of you. You
are fine with that taking years. You see the promising start. What
then, is the problem? The problem is that you have adjusted to a new
equilibrium. As a result, gains are slower and take longer. At this
point, impatience is going to kick in if you don't keep perspective.

You decided to improve health, in
general. You've committed to improving overall health, a bit at a
time. There's no "score" for health, but supposing we used weight for
a proxy - you're at 200 pounds, and want to get to 170 over the next
10 years. You would commit to this regimen, right? Now think how it
feels at the end of the year to go through with this regimen - and
stare at all of a 3 pound loss for your efforts.

People in this situation do one of two things - either give up, or
decide to do something more drastic out of sheer impatience. xxxxx
xxx in spiritual realms, they may go to a workshop, or take dramatic
steps like Landmark xxx

What is needed in this case is to have some easy wins - ways to
improve your health in little ways that you can see. So it may make
sense to focus on adding a particular thing, as part of your regimen,
that may have been bothering you. That way, you keep your goals in
focus, while having something to look forward to.

That is what I'm proposing here. A way to increase motivation in
self-improvement. This makes it easier to stay on track, and have
improvements in more relatively short timeframes.

To do this, you want to focus on problems - problems you have
now. Problems with your own character. That you can find a noticeable
difference in yourself in a year or two of work.
