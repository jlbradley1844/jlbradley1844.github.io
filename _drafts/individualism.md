## What's So Bad About Individualism?

Earlier I talked about the fact that one of the greatest spiritual problems identified
in western/American culture was materialism. A pervasive materialism was becoming a threat
to the unity of society.
Another threat identified by the Baha'i writings is excessive "individualism." But this is 
even murkier than materialism.

Plainly, not all individualism is bad. The Baha'i Faith
in the US would be much smaller were American culture not so individualistic. The fact that I am a 
Baha'i is a point in favor of
individualism. I was born Catholic. In a less individualistic culture, a whole host of 
pressures would have been
arrayed against me to prevent me from changing religion. I would face opposition of family,
nosy neighbors, possibly even community authority figures. And indeed, I've heard tales
of first-generation Baha'is who had to deal with exactly that, from Latin America,
Africa and the mideast. So thank goodness for individualism.

Indeed, the Baha'i writings state exactly that:

> ... the Bahá'í Faith upholds the freedom of conscience which permits a person
> to follow his chosen religion: no one may be compelled to become a Bahá'í, or
> to remain a Bahá'í if he conscientiously wishes to leave the Faith. As to the
> thoughts of the Bahá'ís themselves -- that is those who have chosen to follow
> the religion of Bahá'u'lláh -- the institutions do not busy themselves with
> what individual believers think unless those thoughts become expressed in
> actions which are inimical to the basic principles and vital interests of the
> Faith.
>   (The Universal House of Justice, 1992 Dec 10, Issues Related to Study Compilation)

So plainly, individualism in the case of matters of conscience is upheld, not condemned.

When we think of a "individualist" as describing
a person, we may think of someone who does things on their own, ignores peer pressure,
and follows the dictates of their conscience. Likewise, that seems to be good:

> The first principle Bahá'u'lláh urged was the independent investigation of
> truth. "Each individual," he said, "is following the faith of his ancestors
> who themselves are lost in the maze of tradition.
>      (Compilations, Baha'i Scriptures, p. 276)

> God has not intended man to imitate blindly his fathers and ancestors. He has
> endowed him with mind, or the faculty of reasoning, by the exercise of which
> he is to investigate and discover the truth, and that which he finds real and
> true he must accept. He must not be an imitator or blind follower of any
> soul. He must not rely implicitly upon the opinion of any man without
> investigation; nay, each soul must seek intelligently and independently,
> arriving at a real conclusion and bound only by that reality. The greatest
> cause of bereavement and disheartening in the world of humanity is ignorance
> based upon blind imitation.
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 287)

Here, if individualism means freedom of independent investigation, that too seems
paramont. So when "individualism" is condemned, what exactly is being referred to?

_Defining Individualism_: When looking at one definition in a philosophy dictionary, 
the description is uselessly broad:

> individualism, moral and political: In ethical theory and political philosophy
> individualism is a view that gives primary moral value to individual human beings.
> Different interpretations are possible concerning what it is about individual
> human beings that justifies their being given primary value...
>       (_The Oxford Companion to Philosophy_, ed. Ted Honderich, 2005)

Fortunately, self-described "individualist" philosophers help us define what this mean.
Upon scanning the philosophies of many such people on the English-speaking
internet, there seem to be certain themes that are unarguably "individualist":

- Celebration of individual genius;
- A great love for personal freedom and liberty;
- A dislike for authority, particular from the apparatus of the state;
- The celebration of unrestrained competition in the economic sphere, leaning towards social darwinism.

This is much better, and it is now evident why Baha'i writings may condemn excessive individualism.
A society given to too much individualism is a harsh society with weak
community life, weak governments and impaired democratic institutions. Per the
_Encyclopedia Brittanica_, the famous early political philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville
"described individualism in terms of a kind of moderate selfishness that disposed 
humans to be concerned only with their own small circle of family and friends."
We can all agree with the above list and understand that inside each of these items has a grain
of truth, present society has taken these beliefs too far. Let's examine
these in light of the Baha'i Faith.

## Please, No More Men of Destiny

In the individualistic canon, Great Men of Destiny loom large. Or per Thomas Carlyle,
"The history of the world is but the biography of great men."
Individuals all praise Great Men (somehow it's always men), whose great bit brass
cajones have driven the course of history. Interestingly, history is 
also a rather grim enterprise, one recording
endless wars and fruitless disasters borne of folly. Somehow it is never pointed out that
the Men of Destiny we glorify are the source of such war and folly.
But thanks to individualism, Great Man Thery lives on, particularly nowadays in the lives of
popular culture. Biographies are relateable and easy to read; it works with our narrative
brain. Compared to this, sociology and social history is a slog, no matter how much more it
may explain.

There is something to be said for this form of individualism; personal agency and free will are powerful
concepts, and if you want to become a better person, far better for you to believe that
your choices can have great impact on those around you than to believe yourself to be a
helpless pawn buffeted by forces you can control. The downside of this is the repeated appeal
to ego and a lust for greatness. Baha'i writings do not reflect well on this:

> We behold the generality of mankind worshipping names and exposing themselves,
> as thou dust witness, to dire perils in the mere hope of perpetuating their names,
> whilst every perceiving soul testifieth that after death one's name shall avail
> him nothing except insofar as it beareth a relationship unto God, the Almighty,
> the All-Praised. Thus have their vain imaginings taken hold of them in requital
> for what their hands have wrought. Consider the pettiness of men's minds.
> They seek with utmost exertion that which profiteth them not, and yet wert thou
> to ask of them: "Is there any advantage in that which ye desire?", thou wouldst
> find them sore perplexed.
>         (Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 81)

How about a few more?

> Erelong these outward trappings, these visible treasures, these earthly
> vanities, these arrayed armies, these adorned vestures, these proud and
> overweening souls, all shall pass into the confines of the grave, as though
> into that box. In the eyes of those possessed of insight, all this conflict,
> contention and vainglory hath ever been, and will ever be, like unto the play
> and pastimes of children.
>         (Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 167)

> Would it profit you in the least if, as ye fondly imagine, your names were to
> endure? Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! Was the idol 'Uzza made any greater
> by this, that its name lived on amidst the worshippers of names?
>        (Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 46)

Pride is known conventionally as The Deadliest Mortal Sin, but if that's the case,
the newspapers of today reek of the sin, being as the headlines are constantly
flogging the doings of self-important entertainers, business tycoons, and
entertainer-business-tycoons. Notably, if one wanted to read _actual news_, you'd
do well to ignore those headlines and read the remaining five percent of the
articles (including the comics, sure). One might actually find out what is
going on in economics, science and arts. You know, where people actually do stuff
instead of concentrating on being famous.

Humility is noted as a virtue, but it also functions as a signal. One might
actually use it to spot something worthwhile that someone is doing. If your
goal of following the news is to learn the goings on of the world, what better
means than finding out from those that actually do?

You can tell an effective church - it's the ones where the church is known for doing
great things, and you never hear about the pastor. The Baha'i Faith is the same way.
Notably, the Universal House of Justice, the Supreme ruling body of the Baha'i
community, despite its importance, is composed by relatively obscure members. I probably
could not name a single memeber currently serving. Those 
elected generally do not have their
names trumpeted, nor are new believers aware of anything other than nine people serve
at any given time. Their membership is unimportant, and the rare times I've met them
in person (usually after they have served), they are keen to point out that outside
of their meeting chamber, they have no special status as believers. Once they cease
serving, they have no authority. While there is plenty of hagiography in Baha'i
histories, especially for those long gone, the Baha'i Faith is loath to give important
to particular indiviuals; the respect is reserved for _the office_, not the individual. 
Or as a wall street trader who wants demanded an exhorbitant bonus for bringing in hundreds
of millions of dollars was once told: "The value is not created by you, but the chair
you sit in on the trading floor."

This attitude towards individual importance extends to the individuals of humanity in general.
The work _Century of Light_ is an interesting history; it was written on behalf of the 
Universal House of Justice, and while it isn't "holy writ," it is a good reflection
of Baha'i thought. It seems the very opposite of the Great Man
theory of history. The book is the history of the twentieth century, of both the world as a
whole and the Baha'i Faith. Notably, the only actual persons referred to at length are central 
figures of the faith; other twentieth century figures are mentioned in passing, generally 
to frame certain movements for great evil and great good. Per this book, history was "written"
by the masses of people; not so much
by Martin Luther King as by the coalition of black and white people across all faiths who
worked in unity to make their vision of racial harmony a reality; and Hitler could not have 
caused such destruction without
the hordes of eager brownshirts ready to do evil given only the flimsiest excuses.
The history of the world is indeed written by nameless men and their choices. As
Abdu'l-Baha once said of his cause:

>  The real work is now not being carried on by separate individuals but by
>  those who are casting aside individualism and are adhering to the principles
>  of Unity in thought, spirit and action.
>    (SOW - Star of the West, Star of the West -  1)

If in Thomas Carlyle's "Great Man Theory" one sees a longing for a natural aristocracy,
the Baha'i Faith represents an refreshing attitude that will have none of it.

## Knocking Liberty Down a Peg

Liberty is generally desired in American society. Indeed, it is so glorified, it has
a political party ostensibly dedicated to epanding it. It is a central conceit to our
unique American individualism. Here is what Baha'u'llah, our
Prophet and Founder of The Baha'i Faith, says about liberty:

> We find some men desiring liberty, and priding themselves therein. Such men
> are in the depths of ignorance. Liberty must, in the end, lead to sedition,
> whose flames none can quench. Thus warneth you He Who is the Reckoner, the
> All-Knowing. Know ye that the embodiment of liberty and its symbol is the
> animal. That which beseemeth tman is submission unto such 
> restraints as will protect him
> from his own ignorance, and guard him against the harm of the mischief-maker.
> Liberty causeth man to overstep the bounds of propriety, and to infringe on
> the dignity of his station. It debaseth him to the level of extreme depravity
> and wickedness.  Regard men as a flock of sheep that need a shepherd for
> their protection. This, verily, is the truth, the certain truth. We approve
> of liberty in certain circumstances, and refuse to sanction it in others.
>      (Baha'u'llah, Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 63)

This is usually a fun quote to horrify the deeply patriotic, who have had Liberty
drummed into their head as so inalianably American that they cannot think otherwise
but deify it. But it doesn't take too much though to realize that the members of
a wolf pack, or a tribe of chimpanzees have full freedom, yet we hardly envy their
situation.

The following statement 
regarding freedom of belief by Abdu'l-Baha, the son of the Founder and authorized interpreter
of the Faith, puts things into the proper context:

> The more the conscience of man develops, the more will his heart be free and
> his soul attain unto happiness. In the religion of God, there is freedom of
> thought because God, alone, controls the human conscience...

So freedom is good, right? But Abdu'l-Baha continues,

> ... but this freedom
> should not go beyond courtesy. In the religion of God, there is no freedom of
> action outside the law of God. Man may not transgress this law, even though
> no harm is inflicted on one's neighbour. This is because the purpose of
> Divine law is the education of all -- others as well as oneself -- and, in
> the sight of God, the harm done to one individual or to his neighbour is the
> same and is reprehensible in both cases.
>     (The Universal House of Justice, 1992 Dec 10, Issues Related to Study Compilation)

The problem with unrestrained liberty is _our actions impact others_. And in the 
Baha'i writings, this is
something we are never allowed to forget.

There are a few problems with untrammeled liberty. One is a practical necessity of
living in a society: _disunity_. The Baha'i writings regard disunity as the source of
many of the problems of society. 

>  Disunity is a danger that the nations and peoples of the earth can no longer
>  endure; the consequences are too terrible to contemplate, too obvious to
>  require any demonstration. "The well-being of mankind," Bahá'u'lláh wrote
>  more than a century ago, "its peace and security, are unattainable unless
>  and until its unity is firmly established."
>       (The Universal House of Justice, 1985 Oct, The Promise of World Peace, p. 5)

It's important to note that disunity is not the same
as having a disagreement, a difference of opinion, or even different strongly held beliefs.
Were that the case, it would be an unavoidable condition, which could be relieved
only by the most onerous sorts of repression. That solves nothing and just creates the
conditions for additional disunity; as Baha'u'llah puts it, "not a union that would lead 
to disunity or a concord which would create discord"`(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 167).
Disunity, instead, refers to the sorts
of unnecessary conflicts borne of venality:


If you've of a particularly idealistic bent, you've probably been involved with the
following: an organization that is supposedly dedicated towards working
for social good, but instead spends it time fighting with one another, and the
membership is riven with political intrigues. That is disunity. Regarding his own
cause, Baha'u'llah writes:

> Nothing whatsoever can, in this Day, inflict a greater harm upon this Cause
> than dissension and strife, contention, estrangement and apathy, among the
> loved ones of God.
>       (Baha'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 8)

The final problem with liberty is more spiritual or religious than social: if you
are an ethical person, then _you are not really at liberty_. Your ethics constrain
you in a way they do not contain your fellow man. Additionally, you have probably
figured out that _no one is truly at liberty_. Everyone has temptations, and no one is
less at liberty than someone with no external constraints but who is a slave to their
own passions. It was stated in that opening quote: "That which beseemeth man is 
submission unto such restraints as will protect him from his own ignorance, and 
guard him against the harm of the mischief-maker."

So that is why the Baha'i viewpoint on liberty. In matters of conscience and reason,
it is an absolute necessity. In other matters, it is usually the wrong solution to
the wrong problem.

## The Prepetual Unseriousness of Adolescent Rebellion

A dislike for authority is commonly thought of as a necessary trait - indeed,
it is seen as all-American. This is upheld in certain fictions we talk about in
American history and in practically every Hollywood movie aimed at teenagers (apparently
all of them, in other words). It doesn't take much reflection to know that this is
not borne of intellectual objection; it's a knee-jerk reaction. It's also a sign of
privilege. People who admit no authority from government or
the learned are often the first people to blame incidents of police brutality on the
failure of the victim to properly yield to force. Those who recognize no authority
for themselves are frequently the first to call for authority and obedience from others.

The reality, of course, is that respect for authority is a necessary function of
society. One may debate whether one authority or another is corrupt, in need
of reform, or not truly legitimate. However, there is a point where a persistent
disregard for the very idea of authority becomes a problem of society. The Baha'i
writings are clear about the damage this can cause:

>  These characteristics are conspicuous, for example, in the inordinate
>  scepticism regarding authority, and consequently, in the grudging respect
>  which the citizens of various nations show toward their governments; they
>  have become pronounced in the incessant promotion of individualism, often to
>  the detriment of the wider interests of society. How aptly, even after the
>  lapse of half a century, Shoghi Effendi's views, as conveyed by his
>  secretary, fit the contem- porary scene: "Our present generation, mainly due
>  to the corruptions that have been identified with organizations, seem to
>  stand against any institution. Religion as an institution is denounced.
>  Government as an institution is denounced. Even marriage as an institution
>  is denounced. We Bahá'ís should not be blinded by such prevalent notions.
>       (The Universal House of Justice, 1988 Dec 29, Individual Rights and Freedoms, p. 5)


## Enough With the Struggle For Existence



## Conclusion: The Baha'i Call for Unity


>  The unity which is productive of unlimited results is first a unity of
>  mankind which recognizes that all are sheltered beneath the overshadowing
>  glory of the All-Glorious, that all are servants of one God; for all breathe
>  the same atmosphere, live upon the same earth, move beneath the same
>  heavens, receive effulgence from the same sun and are under the protection
>  of one God. This is the most great unity, and its results are lasting if
>  humanity adheres to it; but mankind has hitherto violated it, adhering to
>  sectarian or other limited unities such as racial, patriotic or unity of
>  self-interests; therefore, no great results have been forthcoming.
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 191)

If the learned and worldly-wise men of this age were to allow mankind to inhale the fragrance of fellowship and love, every understanding heart would apprehend the meaning of true liberty, and discover the secret of undisturbed peace and absolute composure. Were the earth to attain this station and be illumined with its light it could then be truly said of it: 'Thou shall see in it no hollows or rising hills.'[1]
[1 Qur'án 20:106.]

	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 162)
