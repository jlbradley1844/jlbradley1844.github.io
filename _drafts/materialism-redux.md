## Materialism, Revisited

As a Baha'i, generally, one is concerned about love, justice and unity. And we believe
that indeed, this is what animates all religions. Others may disagree, but this is our
belief. Depending on the culture, the incompatibilities are going to vary.

If you review the more recent Baha'i writings - particularly the more recent letters
from our Universal House of Justice, they have already what the particular problem with
"the West" is, specifically the version refined in the United States. These center around:
* Materialism,
* Individualism, and
* Racism.

Of these, racism is already acknowledged as a social wrong, so I won't touch on that. As
far as individualism, it is clear from the writings that what is meant is a certain sort
of libertarian attitude that says "I am not my brother's keeper," one where people are felt
to have no responsibilities at all to humanity as a whole. As individualistic as most
Americans are, my guess this is still not an attitude that many hold. So broadly, both
racism and individualism would be recognized by Americans as generally bad things, whether
one regards them as collective evils or simply as personal failings.

Materialism, on the other hand is a bit of an outlier. Part of the difficulty is there
are two meanings to materialism:
* Philosophical: the belief that everything that exists is material and can be studied
by scientific properties.
* Perjorative: one who is overly-concerned about owning things, particularly signifiers
of status, such as large estates and expensive clothing, and is prone to overconsumption.

If one is talking about the latter, then here again, most Americans would also agree with
Baha'is that this represents a personal failing worth fixing. This does differ from the
other two chanllenges because consumerism - the glorification of material consumption -
is so embedded in American society that our many channels of media seem to
uniformly glorify materialism, thanks to their dependence on commercial sponsorship. Sometimes it's
hard to tell the difference between the content and the commercials. You can probably
think of people who are hooked on TV shows and YouTube channels dedicated
to celebrating the lifestyles of hedonistic celebrities whose only marketable skill is
conspicuous consumption taken over a series of
extremely expensive vacations. Some of the viewers keep viewing even
knowing the fact that most of those expensive things and vacations are placed in the
show by undisclosed commercial sponsers wanting to push these on the viewers. Still,
just as most Americans seem baffled by the values of a relative they'd regard
as a hardened racist, they're also slightly bewildered by the values of people
who are eager viewers of those glorifying the lifestyles of excessive
consumption. So I think most Americans would agree with the
Baha'is on this.

So when Baha'i authorities are condemning materialism, they're talking about materialism
in the perjorative sense that I use above, not in the philosophical sense. Right?

Hold my non-alcoholic beer while I show something. The Baha'i writings seem uniformly
unwelcoming of materialistic _philosophy_.

>  In cities like New York the people are submerged in the sea of materialism.

While those of you who may lean towards conservative religious viewpoints may be
nodding your head in agreement, most in my circle would be a little bewildered
by this. After all, many of them express skepticism in a spirit world and they have
no problem behaving morally. As long as people behave ethically and think of others,
what's the problem?

I've written elsewhere that many of my agnostic-leaning friends, in spite of their
asserted materialism, are in fact "God-fearing atheists" gifted with good upbringing
and a natural inclination toward goodness, and on some subconscious level, they
are acting on beliefs of Justice, Goodness and Righteousness that however much
they believe otherwise, are entities that simply cannot be defined in the material sense.
In Baha'i parlance, these are _spiritual_ entities. As in, not material.
If you believe in moral reals (that is, that there is such a thing as right and wrong),
you've already taken a half-step into spiritual belief and a belief in a metaphysical,
unproven thing. Obviously, some atheists who believe these things will take umbrage at
this, and tell me as an atheist, they have no duty to be consistently materialistic.
On the contrary, I'm quite happy most atheists are contradictory; the world would
be a horrible place if they all acted like animals the minute the leviathan of The
State took their eye off of them. However, many atheists claim to be materialists and
at the same time holding their community up as models of good behavior, not realizing
that the reason for their good behavior is becase _they aren't really behaving like
materialists_.

There is one phrase Baha'u'llah used repeatedly in his writings to others who asked
him confounding philosophical questions:


The question one might ask, therefore, is, do materialistic (or physicalist, if you're
being more contemporary), serve the present concerns of this day and age? I believe
they do not.
