## OK, Here's the Real Problem with Men

I made the mistake the other day of watching a YouTube video. The reason I watched it was
it appeared it would be informative. The reason it was a mistake was the topic.

The topic was "the trouble with boys." It was reasonable, measured discussion of the
problems many boys have growing up nowadays. It noted many facts, such as: the fact boys
are less successful academically than girls; the fact boys having more challenges with
behavior and learning disability; the issues arising from boys' developmentental milestones
in cognition and development, which occur around a year later than girls. The presenter
noted that for grown men and women, there is no such inequality, and in the professional
world parity has been reached in all fields except those that have been traditionally
hostile to women and still may have some barriers. The presenter had no hostility toward
the women's rights movement, and indicated no desire to go back to the past; he also noted
that men in the professional class cannot in any way be said to be disadvantage. The
disadvantage comes in the lower reaches of the economic scale, where boys destined for
the working class come out of their childhood unequipped to contribute at the same level
as women, being unprepared for the more well-paying opportunities and trades and the
caring professions that would allow them to make a living.

The topic was reasonable and well-researched, and the recommendations were broad and
reasonable (e.g. consider "red-shirting" 5-year old boys for a year if they seem
they are still not ready for school). The reason I regret it is I now get a load
of crap in my YouTube feed. Apparently I signaled to YouTube that I am not interested
in "men's right," and I now want to watch videos where "men's rights" cranks blame their problems
on femenists, or watch propaganda from the paid liars telling me how evil solar
and wind power is.

I do think the problem with the way men is raised is real. And the youtube presenter did suggest
serious answers. In particular: "Redshirting" many or even most boys; that is, starting them in
kindergarten or first grade one year later, being that boys of ages 5 or 6 are simply
not ready for school in the way girls are; having more male teachers and staff in the primary schools and
kindergarten as role models; more emphasis on the possibilities of "the caring professions" in
high school counseling for teenage boys. These are all modest, reasonable, and achievable.

This is not a new problem that has been identified.
The original men's rights movements, with their the Robert Bly
writings and drumming circles, seemed to at least be onto something, in that the identified
certain unrealistic roles men were expected to fill as being the problem. This movement
was particularly appealing to
men who had deep unease about certain backwards-looking ideas about innate aggression.
Unfortunately this movement, which was generally concurrent with the New Age movements
of the eighties and nineties, soon flamed out. If you are old enough to remember the
term SNAG (Sensitive New Age Guy) or remember characters like the squishy long-haired
teacher on _Beavis and Butthead_, then you probably remember this movement, and wonder
where it went. However, I believe that such men had a finger on the problem, 
in spite of how self-parodying the movement's solutions may have seemed.

If only that were the case with the "solutions" posed by many contemporary
"men's rights" writers. If anything, their assumptions
and attitudes do nothing but worsen things by creating other problems.
For instance, "feminism" is frequently blamed for such issues,
but it's hard to see how rolling back the clock on woman's rights will change 
any of the actual issues holding back boys and young men,
such as lack of school readiness due to slower frontal neocortext development. In fact,
the attacks against feminism are such a nonsequiter,
so removed from the actual problems being debated, that the
only explanation is such commenters are simply looking for
a convenient platform for venting their gripes.

After the "first generation," new-agey men's rights movement faded, the more skeptical,
finding the whole movement silly, instead took refuge in traditional roles. This was
made thanks to the buzzy nineties writings of the "evolutionary psychology" folk.
Intentionally or not, the sensationalistic work that caught everyone's attention was
the work that seemed to justify stereotypical sexual behavior. "Hey look, men CAN'T be
monogomous! Hey look, women NEED committment and want a successful breadwinner" and so
on. And so, the men's rights movement of
today is not nearly so likely to blame cultural roles that reward overly-masculine
behavior, but rather blame cultural demands that require polite civilized behavior.
The need to work together, study and reflect, qualities
that are prized in an academic and professional culture and that are increasingly
important in high-skill, high-paying profession are felt incompatibile with
manhood. Real Men, thanks to the magic of testosterone, are said to be risk-taking,
adventurous and aggresive. Men are born to be fighters, and any culture that penalizes
them for fighting as hard as they want is somehow unfit for them.

I wish this were a straw man, but it isn't. Pick up any men's magazine and you'll
see the glorification of such real men. Depending on the audience, such men
could be unreflective or profound; simple or educated; extremely well-dressed or
not. But the ideal they present is consistent: someone who courts and conquers whatever
women they desire, pushes their way to the top, and finds a way to win.
Nor have religious leaders been much better; many churches have given into the temptation to
grow their ministries by catering to these notions. Perhaps no men's right book has been as
influential within churches as the old evangelical favorite _Wild at Heart_. This book posed that the
Christian church as practiced had problems retaining men because it was feminizing
in practice; that men were beings of action, incapable of the stillness and
reflection and prayer, and that a real man was a conquering hero to his wife
and feels empty if she cannot fight for her. And if you look at the "self-help" books
men read - a narrow marketing segment if there ever was one - you'll generally find
books like _Power_, which seems to be an updated version of the old _Looking Out for
Number One_. Why work on yourself when you can step on the Little People instead?

As a result, many men are concerned about the problems of young men - and young men do
have problems earlier generations do not have - but they cannot see the problem 
because their upbringing as men has trained them to not see the problem. The problem is this:

    Morally and spiritually, too many men are developmentally arrested.
    To use a non-PC term (the men's rights groups love those), most men are "spiritually retarded."

To this end, the effort of decades of men's rights movements has been thoroughly
counterproductive. The glorification
of stereotypical men's behavor - aggression, fighting and general @ssh0lery as somehow
being "natural" to men and deserving of accomodation by society - is a part of the
problem, not the solution. Men would be happier and better of had the world never
decided to accomodate such ideas.

### A Counterexample

Since the defenders of "Men's Rights," those who feel that men are not disabled,
but differently-abled in the world with their testoserone-based superpowers of agression
and intimidation, are so fond of just-so stories about our evolutionary nature, I feel
the need to engage in my own.

Consider the mandrill baboon.

Mandrill baboons are known mainly for their appearance - their colorful, photogenic faces
and their fire-engine-red butts. Once you know about their societies, you'll forget the
appeare and think you've stepped into the worlds' worst society. Mandrill baboons 
live in tribes in the wild. People who have studied them have noted
that they spend perhaps only a few hours out of their day procuring food and doing what is
needed to survive. Given this easy living, they do what mandrill baboons do in the remaining
hours - making life horrible for other mandrill baboons. The males, of course, spend
their life entirely in agression-based dominance behavior in attempts to become the leaders
of their packs. Not that this is an enviable position, since doing so automatically
makes you a target of the other mandrill baboons. Of course, they are said to do this
because this allows them to mate with all sorts of female baboons. No word on whether the
female baboons enjoy this sort of behavior or not.

If you're one of those people that think evolution is all about design and fitness and
that everything is somehow adaptive, it would be hard to figure why evolution has made 
baboons in this manner. The solution to this puzzle lies in the fact that evolution doesn't
particularly care what behavior is selected for, provided it doesn't kill off the
species entirely. Plainly, humans outnumber mandrill baboons exceptionally, so perhaps
humans are a bit more adaptive. Meanwhile, nature in its wisdom has chosen to make the
mandrill baboon a sometimes-hilarous example to humans of just how miserable we can
make each other if we are bound and determined to show our worst side to everyone all
of the time.

So it's very difficult to figure is why many of these "men's rights" beta males actually think
a baboon pack is a good description of ideal, or even actual, human behavior.

Let's consider, shall we, what would happen to any male in a hunter-gatherer society
who decided to take control of a pack in the same manner as a mandrill baboon alpha.
He would rally the beta males and rule with an iron fist. He and his friends would
have his pick of food and mates. And one day he would not wake up, due to a mysterious
head injury received while sleeping. Or he would not return from his hunting party,
due to an "accident."
People, you see, don't take fondly to other people who act like alpha baboons.
History is replete with kings who ruled with an iron fist - and stories of their
violent deaths. 
Yet somehow the male-as-alpha-baboon, who takes what he wants and makes no excuses,
figures prominently in male self-help literature.

### The Problem With Baboon Masculinity

The problem with men is that they are fed a bunch of pseudoscientific lies about
manhood and masculinity, testosterone and animal instinct, so much so that many of them are
mentally impaired when it comes to moral decision making and spiritual self-awareness.

Men do start with a natural handicap in this area, one which present individualistic
culture does nothing to help. Women, for multiple reasons - acculturation, earlier brain
development, their physically smaller status - are less likely to use physical force
as a crutch to get their way. They learn at an early age that it pays to be nice - at
least, *act* nice, and treating other people as you treat yourself is important.
The fact that few fathers and mothers groom their girls to be world-conquerying
heroic Women of Destiny only adds to the icing on the cake, while many men find toxic levels of
ambition encouraged and cultivated, to such a level that it endangers proper character developent.

Meanwhile, combine that with the already-acknowledged fact that girls develop their executive
skills a year earlier and you have an environment in which girls aren't necessarily
_groomed_ for being good, but at least do not have any particular impetus to
tolerate bad behavior. Likewise, they do decide to cultivate their spiritual side, society is
nothing if not indulgent; indeed, spiritual pursuits in the West seem as dominated
by women as the lower-division education. Which itself is dependent on people who
are more oriented in seeing others succeed than themselves.

For many boys, their upbringing is more mixed. For many in the Man=Testoserone crowd,
men are intrinsically violent, and asking them to be peaceful and behave is to
go against their instintive nature. Indeed, the dominating conceit of many Christian
"Men's ministries" is that moral lessons must be adapted to Men's unique
strengths; ones that lay an emphasis on such manly-man ideas such as courage,
honor and loyalty. Asking them to be peaceful and eschew violence will cause them
to rebel or, even worse, turn them into pacifist pantywaists.

This definition of masculinity demands serious pushback. Women can be naturally violent as well.
There are a few factors that mitigate against that. Fighting is generally something
that implies poor frontal lobe development, a very important difference between
girls and boys growing up. Not only is fighting rarer, but it is sanctioned more
heavily. Women quickly get the message that _girls don't fight_, unlike their
more rambunctions brothers, whose fights are greeted as a shrug of _boys will be
boys_. Also, girls are more in danger of getting their butts kicked. As a kid, there
is a strong prohibition against boys hitting girls, but if you're the girl thinks
of physically bullying a girl, are you really going to ignore the fact she has
a larger older brother?

No, the problem is that girls are given unambiguous moral lessons and boys are
not. We care that girls behave good, but when it comes to boys, only some people care.

Anyone who has children will quickly learn the fact - _boys and girls are different_.
Science bears this out. By the time both men and women have fully matured, there is
no detectable difference along a number of axes of personality and mental capability.
Where significantly statistical differences are detected, they are very small. And so
for most of us adults working in reasonably integrated environments, one can treat
gender as a relatively unimportant factor in weighing if someone will be a capable
and compatible coworker and friend. A concept which would seem laughable to a second
grade teacher who has to deal with boys and girls as if they are different alien
cohabitating species.

The challeng is to give boys and girls consistent moral and spiritual lessons. This is something
both parents and society have completely failed at, and the victims of this are boys.
When you look at all of the broader "Problems of Men" - the violence, the anoeme,
the inability to form mature relationships - all of them trace back to this failure.

There are two broad problems. The first is that boys suffer the soft bigotry of low
expectations. If a boy has a behavioral problem, it is far more likely to be scratched
up to "boys being boys." Or, perhaps, "all boys suffer a little ADHD." Even little things seen
as sitting still and behaving are somehow seen as beyond their capability. Some of this
can be traced right back to the different rate of brain development - at the same
age, a girl will find it much easier to pay attention and sit still than a boy. But
it is one thing to have somewhat lower expectations for good behavior from a boy. It's
another thing entirely to excuse entirely categories of bad behavior from boys under
the theory that boys can't help it.

The second, and possibly worse problem, is that too many boys are given lessons about
masculinity that directly undercut the moral lessons they are given otherwise. As a
girl, you are talk to be good. As a boy, you should be good... but don't be _too good._

I wonder how many girls learned the following lessons growing up:
* It's better to be pissed on than pissed of
And for God's sakes, whatever you do, _don't be a pushover_.

Those lessons are drilled into boys from the very beginning.

We know that boys who grow up with father figures have trouble with mature behavior
