## On Propaganda

One of the things that's been in the news a lot is a lot is concern about AI-generated video. There are tools
available that make video fakes available for the general public. The concern is that this will be used by
nefarious forces to sway elections through fake videos. While I'm concerned, I do think some of this is
misplaced. The reason is because it misunderstands how and why such videos are consumed in the first place.

Disinformation - or "fake news," if you will - has been with us nearly as long as democracy has existed. So
has concern about such disinformation swaying voters. The concern is that credulous voters exposed to
this information will be misled. This is often related to a different thought, often expressed by those in
political minorities (and maybe even certain religious minorities ;-)) that 
"if only people were properly informed, _insert
cause here_ would be much more popular!" Both of these points, unfortunately, seem to be misplaced.

The people who have studied disinformation indicate the central problem is not the supply of disinformation;
nor is it the fact credulous people are swayed by it. The central problem is the _demand_ for it.

It turns out that most of the people who share disinformation know, or at least suspect, that the information
they share is fake. They simply do not care. They want to hear it because it tells them what they want to
hear. And in many cases, what they want to hear is information that elevates themselves, elevates their
own "in group," and denigrates those they do not like.
Likewise, the people who most offended by disinformation are, not surprisingly, those targeted by it.

It is a small minority that are concerned by truth and the disinterested search for it. Who, not surprisingly,
find it difficult to do so when "flood the zone with s__t" has become the credo of a large number of media
organizations, who have discovered to their own happiness that they can make a lot of money broadcasting
disinformation to eager consumers.

The problem is broader. Misinformation is a type of _propaganda_. And eagerness to consume propaganda
is a facet of human nature and poses a central problem in any harmonious society.

---------------------------------------------------------------

One of the principals of the Baha'i Faith (you knew that was coming) is the "independent investigation of
the truth." This has been mistaken as an empty pose by skeptics of the Baha'i Faith, and religion in general.
"Isn't religion
all about picking doctrine over scientific truth?" they reflexively object. Others have suspected
this is primarily aimed at undermining religious authorities that opposed the Baha'i Faith, and that the
intention is not to turn a skeptical gaze towards the Baha'i Faith or its founder itself.

Such characterizations misunderstand the nature of this principal. It is not a minor point in the Faith.
It is central to our concept of a self-governing, divinely-inspired organization.
Indeed, one of the books in the junior youth sequence of courses is aimed at ensuring that young adults
(both Baha'i and otherwise!) are able to distinguish misinformation from truth, and apply critical thought
to messages they are exposed to.

The reason for this emphasis is because of its importance to cultivating many ideals that
we believe Baha'u'llah, who we regard as the messenger of God in this Day and Age, has been brought to
this world to spread. These ideals are necessary for the maintenance of civilization, and include:
* Unity
* Justice
* Enlightenment

For all of these to exist among mankind, there needs to be widespread understanding of the truth,
agreement on the facts, and respect for all men, regardless of race, creed or ethnicity. So certain 
sorts of speech are condemned and forbidden by Baha'u'llah in the laws of His Faith:
* gossip
* malicious slander
* false witness (particularly in the press)

However, this is only half of the picture. His followers must be trained to "independently investigate
the truth," because there is a host of misleading speech that falls short of condemned
speech, yet does not bring about truth, justice 
and enlightenment, but the very opposite.

This places **propagand** as speech in a particularly iffy position with respect Baha'i teachings.
Depending on the intention, that speech could certainly also be blameworthy. Unlike
other forms of speech, propaganda often poses as guidance, information, or even conventional
wisdom. Because Baha'is themselves run their religious community and are active in the affairs of the
greater community at large, it is important that Baha'is know how to recognize when they are being targeted
for influence by propaganda or other inflammatory messages intended to provoke a 
passionate, thoughtless response.

The inspiration for this topic is Jason Stanley's book _How Propaganda Works_. This book is not a how-to
guide (thank God), but is a philosophical analysis of propaganda and
how it is used in society. It is not a Baha'i book by any means; in fact, it's leftist critical theory,
and completely nonreligious in nature. However, it is very well reasoned, and the central insights from the
book include why propaganda is crafted as it is, why it threatens self-governing societies, and how it 
can be used to intentionally create disunity in society. For that reason, these arguments have salience
for any Baha'i concerned about their spiritual life, the functioning of their community, and the political
life of the greater community in which they live and work.

The most common form of propaganda in the United States, one so pervasive that it passes without
comment, is the neverending stream of ads that is used to remunerate media and technology companies. While
some ads are actually informative, it's unquestionable that even the most harmless-seeming of these 
messages are crafted to bypass rational thought. Not only do these all bear their own particular messages,
the combined efforts of these advertisements is to expose viewers and readers to many underlying messages:
* Consumption will make you happy;
* You need to "keep up," materially, with other people;
* You must have certain experiences in life to be fulfilled;
and so on. This point won't be belabored here, because social critics have made this argument for
as long as mass media has been around. As you might guess, the program for Baha'i Youth for critical
thought places particular emphasis on making sure youth can deconstruct such messages.

However, the real goal of the book _Propaganda_ is to analyze political propaganda, the sort aimed at
shaping the society in which people live. The author is firmly pro-democratic, and his view of propaganda
is coming from a class-conscious viewpoint. This does not alter the accuracy of his points, and
his analysis goes a long way in explaining both the appeal of populists and the eagerness of major segments
of society to consume misinformative propaganda.

My goal here is not a full overview of all the points of the bug, but just identify certain
critical points that align with certain Baha'i beliefs
about personal conduct, governance and the reformation of society.

1. _Not all propaganda is harmful, but much of it is_. Jason Stanley spends an entire chapter rigorously defining
propaganda. In his definition, **"Propaganda is the manipulation of the rational will to close off debate"**.
Stanley makes a point to distinguish harmful and acceptable propaganda, noting that the term "propaganda" was
not even considered perjorative until the postwar period. Stanley refers to the negative sort of 
propaganda as *demagogery*, and is particularly concerned about *undermining demagogery* which he defines thusly:

    *Undermining demagogery*: a contribution to public discourse that is presented as an embodiment of
    a worthy political, economic or rational ideal, but is in the service of a goal that tends to
    undermine that very ideal.

Stanley's concern is naturally on this last type. However, I would theorize that certain Baha'i beliefs
make even "helpful" propaganda somewhat suspicion. If the goal of propaganda is to bypass rational discourse,
how does this impact community involvement, and does it warp the outcome of consultation? Still, as anyone
who has ever raised a child has known, rational discourse has its limits; propaganda is the only way to 
instill certain values that we know will be helpful to our children. Much as we dislike indoctrination,
sometimes it's the only way to get kids to do their homework and behave at school. And certainly there is
a place for messages in the public service meant to influence behavior.

From a Baha'i point of view, the problem is certain forms of speech, while not being explicitly censured,
can still be particularly harmful. This is especially true when directed at undermining those ideals Baha'i
consider dear.

2. _Undermining propaganda is particularly a threat to public discourse_. Stanley's main concern is that
undermining propaganda so often works to undermine certain features in democracy. As Baha'is, our concerns
are wider; we are particularly concerned about messages that would undermine unity of mankind and the
disinterested search for a shared truth. 

In general, such undermining propaganda works under the cover of "reasonableness." This is necessary to
get inflammatory statements to be taken seriously.
Instead of insisting on unpopular viewpoints at the outset, a claim is deliberately engineered to seem harmlessness,
such that any initial objections may be waved away. Much parodied phrases like "just asking questions"
and "some people say" are commonly used by demagogic politicians for a reason; they allow them to
hide overtly racist or exclusionary ideas under the cover of protecting free discourse in society.
Likewise, tenditious studies and cherry-picked evidence can be used to ensure that
a controversial statement can be defended as "reasonable." This guarantees that anyone challenging
the thesis be forced to debunk the "evidence," however unsound it is, rather than challenge the statement.

In the United States, a particularly common sort of undermining propaganda is that aimed at cultivating
and spreading lies about race. The goal, generally, is to ensure that black Americans, while still
being consiered Americans, have as little say as possible in governance of their own communities.
As an example of this propaganda, consider much of the contemporary
discourse around "inner city problems" and "out-of-control crime"; Stanley traces the 
geneology of contemporary terms such as
"inner city poverty," "black-on-black violence" and "welfare queens" to the era just after the
civil rights movement. At that time, it suddenly became unfashionable to explicitly traffic in
slurs and unjustified prejudices when discussing black Americans. Instead,
it was found politically expedient to invent proxy terms that would pander to the continued
antipathy towards Blacks by many Americans. Those who believed in the
inferiority of blacks could then pose their prejudices as legitimate concerns, as if wishing to solve legitimate
problems. Dialog around suddenly race focused on the "culture of inner-city Blacks," allowing the
speakers to pathologize blacks as suffering not from poverty, but from an inferior culture; speakers could then
bypass the ridicule heaped on those proposing suddenly-unpopular notions of genetic inferiority.
Politicians realized that they could cater to such Americans by continuing to confirm
their prejudiced views; media viewpoints could likewise
cater to such viewpoints without explicitly endorsing them. 

What makes this propaganda "undermining" is the fact that it implicitly endorses racist views,
while appearing to actually be concerned with the health of the black community.
Such framings impede
public discourse, since it is impossible to address the prejudicial assumptions embeedded in 
this terminology without a lengthy
discourse into exactly why these terms are problematic. Within the context of
a Baha'i consultation this is marginally less problematic, since it is generally possible to do this
without derailing the consultation. In the general society, however, this becomes particularly difficult
since most discussions are focused on one side "winning" than on reaching any sort of consensus.
So much so that in the eighties, many Blacks felt impelled to accomodate the use of prejudicial
terminology simply to move the conversation forward.

Baha'is are explicitly warned against the sort of mindset that accepts this form of racist propaganda:
in the thrities, Baha'i authority Shoghi Effendi warned the American community

> Let the white ... abandon once for all their usually inherent and at times subconscious sense 
> of superiority, to correct their tendency towards revealing a patronizing attitude towards the 
> members of the other race...

	(_Advent of Divine Justice_)

The poisonous views and methods of the so-called "race realists" are well-known by Baha'is, but there
are many other sorts of undermining propaganda Baha'is must deal with. I've already mentioned the
undercurrent of materialistic propaganda in much of today's society. Adolescents are far more likely
to "lose their faith" over such materialistic propaganda than they are by any other means, should they be
among the unhappy lot that thinks consumption and indulgence can solve all their problems. 
But there are different sorts of undermining
propaganda working within Baha'i communities, though not readily identified as such. Consider the
discussions on internet forums where "the 
independent investigation of
truth" is used to peddle unsubstantiated unscientific theories, 
or claims of the need for "the unfettered expression of opinions" being used to defend the airing of inflammatory,
unsubstantiated claims about the motivations of elected or appointed leaders in the Baha'i
community. Such propaganda attempts to undermine the Baha'i Faith by misusing cherished Baha'i
ideals to target the workings of the Faith.

Fortunately, the Baha'i Faith is still far too small for anyone to bother with carrying out any sort
of targeted propaganda campaign either within it or against it from the outside community. The main
concern is the increasing use of propaganda and misinformation in American life, and the temptation it
poses for Baha'is to cause themselves to side publicly and politically for or against an 
identified political party.

3. _Propaganda is not a means of communication, but of control._


4. _Corollary: the goal of propaganda is not to inform, but to block the acquisition of knowledge_.


5. _Ideologies are particularly problematic impediments to the acquisition of knowledge._

_Politically, there are two particularly problematic ideologies in society - those of those 
in control of the resources
about why they have resources, and those not in control of resources regarding why they do not have resources._


6. _People adhering to a particular ideology or point of view will actively _seek out_ propaganda confirming
their world view_.
