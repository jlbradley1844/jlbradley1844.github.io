## A Reading List of Contemporary Philosophy

I've tried to put together a reading list, mostly aimed
at "contemporary" philosophers. Why contemporary? Because the best way
to benefit from the field is to study it "as it is." Philosophy, like
science, not only builds on top of its own ideas, but tends to throw
out old ones as unworkable or inconsistent. While study of classic
philosophers are necessary, if only to understand what current
philosophers are talking about, it is necessary to be economical. Not
only is there a lot of old philosophy, much of it is now provably
wrong. While that may be true of some contemporary philosophy as well,
one at least has the benefit of assuming that many of the ideas
discussed are not quite proven wrong yet.

On the other hand, not just _any_ reading list will not do. There is a
reason religious people - and many Baha'is - do not look to philosophy
as often as they might. For over a century, dominant strains of
Western philosophy were hostile not only to religion, but discussion
of spirituality of any form. Schools of emperical positivism in the
late ninteenth century, followed by the analyitic positivist who found
themselves dominant by the mid-twentieth century forced the entire
field of study to be nominally atheistic and suspicious, if not
downright hostile, to many of the ideals held dear so anyone of even
the slightest religious inclination. Meanwhile, entire philosophies
have been wholly invented out of cloth to justify movements that would
otherwise be difficult to defend ethically. While this is often
associated with totalitarian philosophies embodied in various writings
such as _Mein Kampf_, Mao's "Little Red Book" and various Stalinist
apologetics, the English-speaking world also has their own
atheistic deification of the "market society" in Ayn Rand. This does
not mean the best philosophy of the twentieth century is erroneous per
say; rather, the most popular English-speaking schools of philosophy
have shrunken the concerns of philosopy down to statements of logic
and emperically testable facts, and an outright disdain for matters of
metaphysics, teleology and ethics.

Given that these matters are very much of concern to Baha'is - indeed,
to all non-philosophers - it is necessary to read a bit more
widely. Rather than simply blacklist philosophers whose writings are
inimical to the spirit of Faith as to prove useless in the search for
truth and shared understandings, it is better to identify those that
are useful.

I'm only an early student of philosophy, so am just getting
started. But as soon as one starts learning beyond the "Philosophy
101" level, it becomes very obvious: Philosophy is a _big_ field. That
means lots of schools, and lots of specializations. So to this end,
this reading list is going to proceed based on these sections, with a
little note as to why the field may be useful. I've taken the
suggestions of Wilmette Institute instructor Mikhail Sergeev to heart:
find the foundational tests for the various movements of the twentieth
centry and work forward from there. While many of these writers will
not explicitly comport to a Baha'i world view, many of their various
followers will, and those works cannot be understood without exposure
to these texts.

Analytic:

In the English-speaking world, the dominant school by far is the
analytic school. Analytic philosophers married empericism and
verificationist tendencies with hardcore mathematics. The goal, one
imagines, was to thrust rigor into philosophy and bring the scientific
process to bear to the field, along with the speed of advance that
this promised. Unfortunately, many of the "greatest philosophers"
acclaimed in the twentieth century English speaking world - Bertrand
Russel, Rudolph Carnap and the whole Vienna circle were explicitly
atheistic in outlook. While not all of them made much of their
atheism, many followers of this method remain hostile to anything even
mildly religious. Indeed, much of the reason so many analytic
philosophers wished away areas like metaphysics and spirituality was
because their unscientific nature was seen as an encumberance to the
field of philosopy and a drag on its reputation.
(It seems you can throw the baby out with the bathwater if you
have no patience for babies.) The modern world view decried in
_Century of Light_ had its foundations built by analytic philosophers.

While this does not mean that all work in this field is in error -
there are plenty of theistic analytic philosophers that have built on
the works of prior atheistic philosophers - it does mean that their
focus is too narrow for someone wishing for tools to apply to their
own life or ideas for their own communities. It is all well and good
to use set theoretic formalisms to set down exactly what one means and
prove other things based on this, but quite another to try to draw
conclusions from the world at large by looking only at what is easy to
analyze. So it is best to familiarize onself with the key texts to
benefit from these ideas, all the while remaining skeptical to its grander
claims against movements of spiritualism or idealism.

The most famous analytic serious philosopher in the English-speaking
world in the twentieth century - indeed, of any sort of philosopher -
is arguably Bertrand Russel, and he must be read, if only to
familiarize oneself with the most common serious objections to theism
and non-materialist metaphysics. (The most common _popular_
philosopher in the "Vienna school" mode is Ayn Rand, and I see no
reason to read her. While perhaps an effective propagandizer for the
worst of positivist beliefs, her philosophical works are seen as to
insufficiently rigiours even by those who otherwise regard her views
positively. Indeed, the fact that philosophers find her work so *prima
facie* flawed is probably the main reason no one of prominence has bothered with a
formal debunking of her works.)
