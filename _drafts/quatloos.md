## Quatloos, Cryptocurrency and the Need for Chaos

One of the more amusing but depressing incidents in my life was the time
I was empaneled on a federal jury for over 4 (!) weeks. It was a regrettable
waste of time that I have only a somewhat funny, but sort of sad, story from
it.

The case was a tax fraud case. The woman who was charged had apparently
bliked the IRS out of over $600,000 dollars. Working with someone else,
who was unnamed and not at that trial, they had managed to claim large,
erroneous tax deductions. The funny part is how it went down. The woman
continued to live in the same home (with a brand new extension) and signs
of her newfound wealth all around - when they raided her home, they even
found a new safe installation, unlocked, with a hundred thousand
dollars of South African gold coins. Obviously, the defendent thought
it was something she could easily get away with.

Inexplicably, the woman _chose to defend herself in court_. She did
have a court-appointed attorney, who struggled mightily. The defendent
kept trying to raise nonexistent laws, point to nonexistent treaties,
tried to distinguish between a "tax identity" (who owed the tax) and
a "legal person" (the person in the court, who did not owe tax); she
was repeatedly redirected by her court-appointed attorney and slapped
down time and again by the judge. References were made to a person
whom was paid $200,000 for assistance with this scheme who, apparently,
provided this woman no service other than to sign a few forms to help
her bilk our treasury. The defense attorney tried a few times to
more fully explain their partner's importance, but the prosecutor would
have none of it; in any event, there was no exculpatory evidence that
would've excused the defendant's behavior.

As the jury we took no more than a half-hour deliberating, as we kept
coming up with increasingly imaginative theories that might, maybe, somehow
explain this behavior. She was so obviously guilty though, that after
our patience ran out, we delivered the verdict an hour later.
As I left, I had to think to myself - what made this woman think she
could get away with it? Why did she think she could defend herself
in court with these bizarre legal theories? And as for her shadowy
partner - what was his role in it, and why did this seem to be the
only thing the prosecutor was worried about?

As a jury member you can't do "freelance" legal research when you're
on the jury, but as soon as you deliver the verdict, there's nothing
to keep you from digging. And I found pay-dirt on a website called
<https://quatloos.com>. Her mysterious partner, as it turns out, was
in Canada fighting extradition after having been involved in over a
dozen so-called "Sovereign Citizen" cases. It was a scam, pure and simple.
The Sovereign Citizen movement is one that holds that the government
is not your govermnet unless you "opt in" to be ruled. This "movement" -
really, just a handful of loons out west - had caused fits with tax
attorneys for years by tying up courts with bizarre legal theories.
The defendent, unfortunately, was a mark for a person who had essentially
"monetized" the whole sovereign citizen shtick - he'd walk his poor
sucker through the paperwork needed to defraud the government, take
around a quarter of a million dollars essentially just for filing
a few fraudulent papers and immediately wire the proceeds to
a Swiss bank account. He also coached the defendent on the legal
theories he claimed would make her "untouchable" in the court case;
naturally, he was long gone by the time the defendent went on
trial.

So ordinarily this would be a sad story. It's pretty obvious why the
prosecutor didn't want any unnecessary discussion about the person she
was working with. It's almost enough to feel sorry for her. Except...

... except this was a person with college degree and a semi-functional
career who went through a messy divorce and got behind on morgage
payments, and was looking for a way to "get ahead." Given what we knew,
there was no way she didn't realize she was bilking her fellow taxpayers
out of over half a million dollars. She didn't think this was a victimless
crime. Her mistake was to think it was a crime that _she could get away
with_, without consequences. It's hard to think how much of this was
sheer gullibility, and how much of this was thievery, but the law does
not differentiate.

Which leads us to...

### Cryptocurrency

Speaking of which, it appears my least-favorite, most opaque technology
is now in the news as the least-favorite investment opportunity.
A raft of cryptocurrency ads in the 2022 Super Bowl seemed to be the
starting gun to burst the crypto bubble, a 22-year old echo of the 2000
Super Bowl underwritten by the ads of soon-to-be Dot-Bomb companies.
What started as a promising but flawed attempt as a small microtransaction
network had balooned into a giant pyramid scheme consisting of 90% hype,
10% carbon dioxide emissions and 0% actual utility. I had invested some
time investigating cryptocurrencies around 2015 and backed out after finding
out several disturbing technical issues (including, crucially, the fact
that deflationary currencies always fail as currencies) and had watched
incredulously as this became an enormously lucrative pump-and-dump scheme,
like the dot-com boom but without any actual value creation.
