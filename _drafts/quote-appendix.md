ASSOCIATION WITH THOSE OF GOOD CHARACTER

When in company with the
infidels, thou art an infidel and with the pious, thou art pious. (TB TA)

... Give ear to the sayings of the Friend and
turn towards His paradise. Worldly friends, seeking their own good, appear
to love one the other, whereas the true Friend hath loved and doth love
you for your own sakes; indeed He hath suffered for your guidance
countless afflictions. Be not disloyal to such a Friend, nay rather hasten
unto Him. (HW-P 52)

O SON OF DUST! Beware! Walk not with the ungodly and seek not fellowship
with him, for such companionship turneth the radiance of the heart into
infernal fire. (HW-P 57)

O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Wouldst thou seek the grace of the Holy Spirit,
enter into fellowship with the righteous, for he hath drunk the cup of
eternal life at the hands of the immortal Cup-bearer and even as the true
morn doth quicken and illumine the hearts of the dead. (HW-P 58)


CHARACTER

A good character is, verily,
the best mantle for men from God. With it He adorneth the temples of His
loved ones. By My life! The light of a good character surpasseth the light
of the sun and the radiance thereof. Whoso attaineth unto it is accounted
as a jewel among men. (TB TA)

O COMPANION OF MY THRONE! Hear no evil, and see no evil, abase not
thyself, neither sigh and weep. Speak no evil, that thou mayest not hear
it spoken unto thee, and magnify not the faults of others that thine own
faults may not appear great; and wish not the abasement of anyone, that
thine own abasement be not exposed. (HW-P 44)


CLEANLINESS

The choice of clothing and the cut of the beard and its dressing are left
to the discretion of men. But beware, O people, lest ye make yourselves
the playthings of the ignorant. (TB BI)


CREATIVITY

That which traineth the world is Justice, for it is
upheld by two pillars, reward and punishment. These two pillars are the
sources of life to the world. Inasmuch as for each day there is a new
problem and for every problem an expedient solution, such affairs should
be referred to the Ministers of the House of Justice that they may act
according to the needs and requirements of the time. They that, for the
sake of God, arise to serve His Cause, are the recipients of divine
inspiration from the unseen Kingdom. (TB BI)


DETACHMENT

O SON OF MAN! If adversity befall thee not in My path, how canst thou walk
in the ways of them that are content with My pleasure? If trials afflict
thee not in thy longing to meet Me, how wilt thou attain the light in thy
love for My beauty? (HW-A 50)

O SON OF MAN! My calamity is My providence, outwardly it is fire and
vengeance, but inwardly it is light and mercy. Hasten thereunto that thou
mayest become an eternal light and an immortal spirit. This is My command
unto thee, do thou observe it. (HW-A 51)

O SON OF BEING! Busy not thyself with this world, for with fire We test
the gold, and with gold We test Our servants. (HW-A 55)

O MY SERVANT! Free thyself from the fetters of this world, and loose thy
soul from the prison of self. Seize thy chance, for it will come to thee
no more. (HW-P 40)


DISPUTATION

O SON OF DUST! Verily I say unto thee: Of all men the most negligent is he
that disputeth idly and seeketh to advance himself over his brother. Say,
O brethren! Let deeds, not words, be your adorning. (HW-P 5)


DUTY

O SON OF SPIRIT! My claim on thee is great, it cannot be forgotten. My
grace to thee is plenteous, it cannot be veiled. My love has made in thee
its home, it cannot be concealed. My light is manifest to thee, it cannot
be obscured. (HW-A 20)

O SON OF MAN! Many a day hath passed over thee whilst thou hast busied
thyself with thy fancies and idle imaginings. How long art thou to slumber
on thy bed? Lift up thy head from slumber, for the Sun hath risen to the
zenith, haply it may shine upon thee with the light of beauty. (HW-A 62)

O MY SERVANTS! Ye are the trees of My garden; ye must give forth goodly
and wondrous fruits, that ye yourselves and others may profit therefrom.
Thus it is incumbent on every one to engage in crafts and professions, for
therein lies the secret of wealth, O men of understanding! For results
depend upon means, and the grace of God shall be all-sufficient unto you.
Trees that yield no fruit have been and will ever be for the fire. (HW-P 80)

It is enjoined upon every one of you to engage in some form of occupation,
such as crafts, trades and the like. We have graciously exalted your
engagement in such work to the rank of worship unto God, the True One. (TB BI)


EXCELLENCE

It is permissible to study sciences and arts, but such sciences as are
useful and would redound to the progress and advancement of the people. (IB BI)

The first Taráz and the first effulgence which hath dawned from the
horizon of the Mother Book is that man should know his own self and
recognize that which leadeth unto loftiness or lowliness, glory or
abasement, wealth or poverty. Having attained the stage of fulfilment and
reached his maturity, man standeth in need of wealth, and such wealth as
he acquireth through crafts or professions is commendable and praiseworthy
in the estimation of men of wisdom, and especially in the eyes of servants
who dedicate themselves to the education of the world and to the
edification of its peoples. (TB TA)

In this Day the sun of craftsmanship shineth above the horizon of the
occident and the river of arts is flowing out of the sea of that region.
One must speak with fairness and appreciate such bounty. (TB TA)


FRIENDSHIP

O FRIEND! In the garden of thy heart plant naught but the rose of love,
and from the nightingale of affection and desire loosen not thy hold.
Treasure the companionship of the righteous and eschew all fellowship with
the ungodly. (HW-P 3)

O people! Consort with the followers of
all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship. (TB BI)

They that are endued with sincerity and faithfulness should associate with
all the peoples and kindreds of the earth with joy and radiance, inasmuch
as consorting with people hath promoted and will continue to promote unity
and concord, which in turn are conducive to the maintenance of order in
the world and to the regeneration of nations. Blessed are such as hold
fast to the cord of kindliness and tender mercy and are free from
animosity and hatred. (...)

This Wronged One exhorteth the peoples of the world to observe tolerance
and righteousness, which are two lights amidst the darkness of the world
and two educators for the edification of mankind. Happy are they who have
attained thereto and woe betide the heedless. (TB TA)



GENEROSITY

O SON OF MAN! Bestow My wealth upon My poor, that in heaven thou mayest
draw from stores of unfading splendor and treasures of imperishable glory.
(HW-A 57)

O CHILDREN OF DUST! Tell the rich of the midnight sighing of the poor,
lest heedlessness lead them into the path of destruction, and deprive them
of the Tree of Wealth. To give and to be generous are attributes of Mine;
well is it with him that adorneth himself with My virtues. (HW-P 49)

O YE THAT PRIDE YOURSELVES ON MORTAL RICHES! Know ye in truth that wealth
is a mighty barrier between the seeker and his desire, the lover and his
beloved. The rich, but for a few, shall in no wise attain the court of His
presence nor enter the city of content and resignation. Well is it then
with him, who, being rich, is not hindered by his riches from the eternal
kingdom, nor deprived by them of imperishable dominion. By the Most Great
Name! The splendor of such a wealthy man shall illuminate the dwellers of
heaven even as the sun enlightens the people of the earth! (HW-P 53)

O YE RICH ONES ON EARTH! The poor in your midst are My trust; guard ye My
trust, and be not intent only on your own ease. (HW-P 54)



GRATITUDE

O SON OF BEING! With the hands of power I made thee and with the fingers
of strength I created thee; and within thee have I placed the essence of
My light. Be thou content with it and seek naught else, for My work is
perfect and My command is binding. Question it not, nor have a doubt
thereof. (HW-A 12)

O SON OF SPIRIT! Ask not of Me that which We desire not for thee, then be
content with what We have ordained for thy sake, for this is that which
profiteth thee, if therewith thou dost content thyself. (HW-A 18)


HUMILITY

O SON OF MAN! Transgress not thy limits, nor claim that which beseemeth
thee not. Prostrate thyself before the countenance of thy God, the Lord of
might and power. (HW24)

O CHILDREN OF DESIRE! Put away the garment of vainglory, and divest
yourselves of the attire of haughtiness. (HW-P 47)

O EMIGRANTS! The tongue I have designed for the mention of Me, defile it
not with detraction. If the fire of self overcome you, remember your own
faults and not the faults of My creatures, inasmuch as every one of you
knoweth his own self better than he knoweth others. (HW-P 66)


JUSTICE

The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice;
turn not away therefrom if thou desirest Me, and neglect it not that I may
confide in thee. By its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and not
through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine own knowledge and not
through the knowledge of thy neighbor. (HW-A 2)

O OPPRESSORS ON EARTH! Withdraw your hands from tyranny, for I have
pledged Myself not to forgive any man’s injustice. This is My covenant
which I have irrevocably decreed in the preserved tablet and sealed with
My seal. (HW-P 64)

O Son of Spirit! The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice;
turn not away therefrom if thou desirest Me, and neglect it not that I may
confide in thee. By its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and not
through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine own knowledge and not
through the knowledge of thy neighbour. Ponder this in thy heart; how it
behoveth thee to be. Verily justice is My gift to thee and the sign of My
loving-kindness. Set it then before thine eyes.


KNOWLEDGE

Knowledge is one of the wondrous gifts of God. It is incumbent upon
everyone to acquire it. Such arts and material means as are now manifest
have been achieved by virtue of His knowledge and wisdom which have been
revealed in Epistles and Tablets through His Most Exalted Pen—a Pen out of
whose treasury pearls of wisdom and utterance and the arts and crafts of
the world are brought to light. (TB TA)


LOGIC

It is men like unto Hádí Dawlat-Ábádí(6) who, with
turban and staff,(7) have been the source of opposition and hindrance and
have so grievously burdened the people with superstitions that even at the
present time they still expect the appearance of a fictitious person from
a fictitious place. Be ye warned, O men of understanding. (TB TA)


LOVE

This Wronged One, rid of all attachment to the world, hath striven
with utmost endeavour to quench the fire of animosity and hatred which
burneth fiercely in the hearts of the peoples of the earth. It behoveth
every just and fair-minded person to render thanks unto God—exalted be His
glory—and to arise to promote this pre-eminent Cause, that fire may turn
into light, and hatred may give way to fellowship and love. I swear by the
righteousness of God! This is the sole purpose of this Wronged One. (TB TA)


MAGNANIMITY

O SON OF EARTH! Know, verily, the heart wherein the least remnant of envy
yet lingers, shall never attain My everlasting dominion, nor inhale the
sweet savors of holiness breathing from My kingdom of sanctity. (HW-A 6)

O QUINTESSENCE OF PASSION! Put away all covetousness and seek contentment;
for the covetous hath ever been deprived, and the contented hath ever been
loved and praised. (HW-P 50)


OBEDIENCE

O SON OF BEING! Walk in My statutes for love of Me and deny thyself that
which thou desirest if thou seekest My pleasure. (HW-A 38)

In every country where any of this people reside, they must behave towards
the government of that country with loyalty, honesty and truthfulness. (TB BI)

They that immerse themselves in the ocean of His utterances should at all
times have the utmost regard for the divinely-revealed ordinances and
prohibitions. Indeed His ordinances constitute the mightiest stronghold
for the protection of the world and the safeguarding of its peoples—a
light upon those who acknowledge and recognize the truth, and a fire unto
such as turn away and deny. (TB TJ)


"PASSION"

O BEFRIENDED STRANGER! The candle of thine heart is lighted by the hand of
My power, quench it not with the contrary winds of self and passion. (HW-P 32)


PATIENCE

O SON OF MAN! For everything there is a sign. The sign of love is
fortitude under My decree and patience under My trials. (HW-A 48)


SACRIFICE

O SON OF MAN! Ponder and reflect. Is it thy wish to die upon thy bed, or
to shed thy life-blood on the dust, a martyr in My path, and so become the
manifestation of My command and the revealer of My light in the highest
paradise? Judge thou aright, O servant! (HW-A 46)


SELF-EXAMINATION

O SON OF BEING! Bring thyself to account each day ere thou art summoned to
a reckoning; for death, unheralded, shall come upon thee and thou shalt be
called to give account for thy deeds. (HW-A 31)


SELF-WORTH

O SON OF MAN! Veiled in My immemorial being and in the ancient eternity of
My essence, I knew My love for thee; therefore I created thee, have
engraved on thee Mine image and revealed to thee My beauty. (HW-A 3)

O SON OF BEING! Thou art My lamp and My light is in thee. Get thou from it
thy radiance and seek none other than Me. For I have created thee rich and
have bountifully shed My favor upon thee. (HW-A 11)

O SON OF BEING! With the hands of power I made thee and with the fingers
of strength I created thee; and within thee have I placed the essence of
My light. Be thou content with it and seek naught else, for My work is
perfect and My command is binding. Question it not, nor have a doubt
thereof. (HW-A 12)

Confession of sins and
transgressions before human beings is not permissible, as it hath never
been nor will ever be conducive to divine forgiveness. Moreover such
confession before people results in one’s humiliation and abasement, and
God—exalted be His glory—wisheth not the humiliation of His servants. (TB BI)

SELFLESSNESS

O SON OF MAN! If thou lovest Me, turn away from thyself; and if thou
seekest My pleasure, regard not thine own... (HW-A 7)


STEADFASTNESS

O MY CHILDREN! I fear lest, bereft of the melody of the dove of heaven, ye
will sink back to the shades of utter loss, and, never having gazed upon
the beauty of the rose, return to water and clay. (HW-P 13)

The second Tajallí is to remain steadfast in the Cause of God—exalted be
His glory—and to be unswerving in His love. And this can in no wise be
attained except through full recognition of Him; and full recognition
cannot be obtained save by faith in the blessed words: ‘He doeth
whatsoever He willeth.’ (TB TJ)

Consider how abject is the state of the disbelievers. They
all give utterance to the words: ‘Verily He is to be praised in His deeds
and is to be obeyed in His behest.’ Nevertheless if We reveal aught which,
even to the extent of a needle’s eye, runneth counter to their selfish
ways and desires, they will disdainfully reject it. (TB TJ)


TACT (& "TEACHING)

O SON OF DUST! The wise are they that speak not unless they obtain a
hearing, even as the cup-bearer, who proffereth not his cup till he
findeth a seeker, and the lover who crieth not out from the depths of his
heart until he gazeth upon the beauty of his beloved. Wherefore sow the
seeds of wisdom and knowledge in the pure soil of the heart, and keep them
hidden, till the hyacinths of divine wisdom spring from the heart and not
from mire and clay. (HW-P 36)

Defile not your tongues with the
cursing and reviling of any soul, and guard your eyes against that which
is not seemly. Set forth that which ye possess. If it be favourably
received, your end is attained; if not, to protest is vain. (TB BI)


THANKFULNESS

We yield praise unto God—hallowed and glorified be He—for whatsoever He
hath graciously revealed in this blessed, this glorious and incomparable
Day. Indeed if everyone on earth were endowed with a myriad tongues and
were to continually praise God and magnify His Name to the end that
knoweth no end, their thanksgiving would not prove adequate for even one
of the gracious favours We have mentioned in this Tablet. Unto this
beareth witness every man of wisdom and discernment, of understanding and
knowledge. (TB BI)


TRUTHFULNESS

One should not ignore the truth of any matter, rather
should one give expression to that which is right and true. The people of
Bahá should not deny any soul the reward due to him, should treat
craftsmen with deference, and, unlike the people aforetime, should not
defile their tongues with abuse. (TB TA)

In these days truthfulness and sincerity are sorely afflicted in the
clutches of falsehood, and justice is tormented by the scourge of
injustice. The smoke of corruption hath enveloped the whole world in such
wise that naught can be seen in any direction save regiments of soldiers
and nothing is heard from any land but the clashing of swords. We beseech
God, the True One, to strengthen the wielders of His power in that which
will rehabilitate the world and bring tranquillity to the nations. (TB TA)

In this Day the secrets of the earth are laid bare before the eyes of men.
The pages of swiftly-appearing newspapers are indeed the mirror of the
world. They reflect the deeds and the pursuits of divers peoples and
kindreds. They both reflect them and make them known. They are a mirror
endowed with hearing, sight and speech. This is an amazing and potent
phenomenon. However, it behoveth the writers thereof to be purged from the
promptings of evil passions and desires and to be attired with the raiment
of justice and equity. They should enquire into situations as much as
possible and ascertain the facts, then set them down in writing. (TB TA)

Fair speech and truthfulness, by reason of their
lofty rank and position, are regarded as a sun shining above the horizon
of knowledge. (TB TA)


TRUSTWORTHINESS

Trustworthiness is the greatest portal
leading unto the tranquillity and security of the people. In truth the
stability of every affair hath depended and doth depend upon it. (TB TA)

One day of
days We repaired unto Our Green Island. Upon Our arrival, We beheld its
streams flowing, and its trees luxuriant, and the sunlight playing in
their midst. Turning Our face to the right, We beheld what the pen is
powerless to describe; nor can it set forth that which the eye of the Lord
of Mankind witnessed in that most sanctified, that most sublime, that
blest, and most exalted Spot. Turning, then, to the left We gazed on one
of the Beauties of the Most Sublime Paradise, standing on a pillar of
light, and calling aloud saying: “O inmates of earth and heaven! Behold ye
My beauty, and My radiance, and My revelation, and My effulgence. By God,
the True One! I am Trustworthiness and the revelation thereof, and the
beauty thereof. I will recompense whosoever will cleave unto Me, and
recognize My rank and station, and hold fast unto My hem. I am the most
great ornament of the people of Bahá, and the vesture of glory unto all
who are in the kingdom of creation. I am the supreme instrument for the
prosperity of the world, and the horizon of assurance unto all beings.”
Thus have We sent down for thee that which will draw men nigh unto the
Lord of creation. (TB TA quoted)

UNITY

O CHILDREN OF MEN! Know ye not why We created you all from the same dust?
That no one should exalt himself over the other. Ponder at all times in
your hearts how ye were created. Since We have created you all from one
same substance it is incumbent on you to be even as one soul, to walk with
the same feet, eat with the same mouth and dwell in the same land, that
from your inmost being, by your deeds and actions, the signs of oneness
and the essence of detachment may be made manifest. (HW-A 68)

Be not the cause of grief, much less of discord and
strife. The hope is cherished that ye may obtain true education in the
shelter of the tree of His tender mercies and act in accordance with that
which God desireth. Ye are all the leaves of one tree and the drops of one
ocean. (TB BI)


WISDOM 

O CHILDREN OF THE DIVINE AND INVISIBLE ESSENCE! Ye shall be hindered from
loving Me and souls shall be perturbed as they make mention of Me. For
minds cannot grasp Me nor hearts contain Me. (HW-A 66)

O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Guidance hath ever been given by words, and now it
is given by deeds. Every one must show forth deeds that are pure and holy,
for words are the property of all alike, whereas such deeds as these
belong only to Our loved ones. Strive then with heart and soul to
distinguish yourselves by your deeds. In this wise We counsel you in this
holy and resplendent tablet. (HW-P 76)

In this Day whatsoever serveth to reduce blindness
and to increase vision is worthy of consideration. This vision acteth as
the agent and guide for true knowledge. Indeed in the estimation of men of
wisdom keenness of understanding is due to keenness of vision. The people
of Bahá must under all circumstances observe that which is meet and seemly
and exhort the people accordingly.

OTHER QUOTES OF INTEREST

O SON OF BEAUTY! By My spirit and by My favor! By My mercy and by My
beauty! All that I have revealed unto thee with the tongue of power, and
have written for thee with the pen of might, hath been in accordance with
thy capacity and understanding, not with My state and the melody of My
voice. (HW-A 67)

O YE SONS OF SPIRIT! Ye are My treasury, for in you I have treasured the
pearls of My mysteries and the gems of My knowledge. Guard them from the
strangers amidst My servants and from the ungodly amongst My people. (HW-A 69)

O YE DWELLERS IN THE HIGHEST PARADISE! Proclaim unto the children of
assurance that within the realms of holiness, nigh unto the celestial
paradise, a new garden hath appeared, round which circle the denizens of
the realm on high and the immortal dwellers of the exalted paradise.
Strive, then, that ye may attain that station, that ye may unravel the
mysteries of love from its wind-flowers and learn the secret of divine and
consummate wisdom from its eternal fruits. Solaced are the eyes of them
that enter and abide therein! (HW-P 18)

O MY SERVANT! Thou art even as a finely tempered sword concealed in the
darkness of its sheath and its value hidden from the artificer’s
knowledge. Wherefore come forth from the sheath of self and desire that
thy worth may be made resplendent and manifest unto all the world. (HW-P 72)

... call thou to mind the one who sentenced Jesus to
death. He was the most learned of his age in his own country, whilst he
who was only a fisherman believed in Him. Take good heed and be of them
that observe the warning. (TB TC)

O concourse of bishops! Ye are the stars of the heaven of My knowledge. My
mercy desireth not that ye should fall upon the earth. My justice,
however, declareth: ‘This is that which the Son hath decreed.’ And
whatsoever hath proceeded out of His blameless, His truth-speaking,
trustworthy mouth, can never be altered. (TB TC)

Beware lest the sayings of
the heedless sadden thee. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, and teach the
people with consummate wisdom. (TB TC)

We cherish the hope that through the earnest endeavours of such as are the
exponents of the power of God—exalted be His glory—the weapons of war
throughout the world may be converted into instruments of reconstruction
and that strife and conflict may be removed from the midst of men. (TB BI)

The first Tajallí which hath dawned from the Day-Star of Truth is the
knowledge of God—exalted be His glory. And the knowledge of the King
of everlasting days can in no wise be attained save by recognizing Him
Who is the Bearer of the Most Great Name... True belief in God and
recognition of Him cannot be complete save by acceptance of that which
He hath revealed and by observance of whatsoever hath been decreed by
Him and set down in the Book by the Pen of Glory. (TB TJ)


GENERAL PURPOSE GRIEF

O SON OF SPIRIT! Noble have I created thee, yet thou hast abased thyself.
Rise then unto that for which thou wast created. (HW-A 22)

O YE THAT ARE LYING AS DEAD ON THE COUCH OF HEEDLESSNESS! Ages have
passed and your precious lives are well-nigh ended, yet not a single
breath of purity hath reached Our court of holiness from you. Though
immersed in the ocean of misbelief, yet with your lips ye profess the one
true faith of God. Him whom I abhor ye have loved, and of My foe ye have
made a friend. Notwithstanding, ye walk on My earth complacent and
self-satisfied, heedless that My earth is weary of you and everything
within it shunneth you. Were ye but to open your eyes, ye would, in truth,
prefer a myriad griefs unto this joy, and would count death itself better
than this life. (HW-P 20)

O SON OF DESIRE! The learned and the wise have for long years striven and
failed to attain the presence of the All-Glorious; they have spent their
lives in search of Him, yet did not behold the beauty of His countenance.
Thou without the least effort didst attain thy goal, and without search
hast obtained the object of thy quest. Yet, notwithstanding, thou didst
remain so wrapt in the veil of self, that thine eyes beheld not the beauty
of the Beloved, nor did thy hand touch the hem of His robe. Ye that have
eyes, behold and wonder. (HW-P 22)

O YE SEEMING FAIR YET INWARDLY FOUL! Ye are like clear but bitter water,
which to outward seeming is crystal pure but of which, when tested by the
divine Assayer, not a drop is accepted. Yea, the sun beam falls alike upon
the dust and the mirror, yet differ they in reflection even as doth the
star from the earth: nay, immeasurable is the difference! (HW-P 25)

O REBELLIOUS ONES! My forbearance hath emboldened you and My
long-suffering hath made you negligent, in such wise that ye have spurred
on the fiery charger of passion into perilous ways that lead unto
destruction. Have ye thought Me heedless or that I was unaware? (HW-P 64)

O CHILDREN OF FANCY! Know, verily, that while the radiant dawn breaketh
above the horizon of eternal holiness, the satanic secrets and deeds done
in the gloom of night shall be laid bare and manifest before the peoples
of the world.

O CHILDREN OF VAINGLORY! For a fleeting sovereignty ye have abandoned My
imperishable dominion, and have adorned yourselves with the gay livery of
the world and made of it your boast. By My beauty! All will I gather
beneath the one-colored covering of the dust and efface all these diverse
colors save them that choose My own, and that is purging from every color.

Consider the people of
former times. What were their deeds and what fruit did they gather? Every
thing they uttered was but imposture and whatever they wrought hath proved
worthless, except for those whom God hath graciously protected through His
power. (TB TA)

Give ear unto that which the people of
tyranny ascribe unto Me in My days. Some of them say: ‘He hath laid claim
to divinity’; others say: ‘He hath devised a lie against God’; still
others say: ‘He is come to foment sedition’. Base and wretched are they.
Lo! They are, in truth, enslaved to idle imaginings. (TB TA)
