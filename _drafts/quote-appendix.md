ASSOCIATION WITH THOSE OF GOOD CHARACTER

When in company with the
infidels, thou art an infidel and with the pious, thou art pious. (TB TA)

... Give ear to the sayings of the Friend and
turn towards His paradise. Worldly friends, seeking their own good, appear
to love one the other, whereas the true Friend hath loved and doth love
you for your own sakes; indeed He hath suffered for your guidance
countless afflictions. Be not disloyal to such a Friend, nay rather hasten
unto Him. (HW-P 52)

O SON OF DUST! Beware! Walk not with the ungodly and seek not fellowship
with him, for such companionship turneth the radiance of the heart into
infernal fire. (HW-P 57)

O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Wouldst thou seek the grace of the Holy Spirit,
enter into fellowship with the righteous, for he hath drunk the cup of
eternal life at the hands of the immortal Cup-bearer and even as the true
morn doth quicken and illumine the hearts of the dead. (HW-P 58)

Time and again have We admonished Our beloved ones to avoid, nay to flee
from, anything whatsoever from which the odour of mischief can be
detected. The world is in great turmoil, and the minds of its people are
in a state of utter confusion. We entreat the Almighty that He may
graciously illuminate them with the glory of His Justice, and enable them
to discover that which will be profitable unto them at all times and under
all conditions. (TB LD)

[re. the "true seeker"] He should
treasure the companionship of them that have renounced the world, and
regard avoidance of boastful and worldly people a precious benefit. (G CXXV)


CHARACTER (and Virtue)

A good character is, verily,
the best mantle for men from God. With it He adorneth the temples of His
loved ones. By My life! The light of a good character surpasseth the light
of the sun and the radiance thereof. Whoso attaineth unto it is accounted
as a jewel among men. (TB TA)

O COMPANION OF MY THRONE! Hear no evil, and see no evil, abase not
thyself, neither sigh and weep. Speak no evil, that thou mayest not hear
it spoken unto thee, and magnify not the faults of others that thine own
faults may not appear great; and wish not the abasement of anyone, that
thine own abasement be not exposed. (HW-P 44)

It behoveth the people of Bahá to render the Lord victorious through the
power of their utterance and to admonish the people by their goodly deeds
and character, inasmuch as deeds exert greater influence than words. (TB KF)

Say: Honesty, virtue, wisdom and a saintly character redound to the exaltation
of man, while dishonesty, imposture, ignorance and hypocrisy lead to his
abasement. By My life! Man’s distinction lieth not in ornaments or wealth,
but rather in virtuous behaviour and true understanding. (TB KF)

In the estimation of the
people of Bahá man’s glory lieth in his knowledge, his upright conduct,
his praiseworthy character, his wisdom, and not in his nationality or
rank. (TB KF)

Arise, O people, and, by the power of God’s might, resolve to
gain the victory over your own selves, that haply the whole earth may be
freed and sanctified from its servitude to the gods of its idle
fancies—gods that have inflicted such loss upon, and are responsible for
the misery of their wretched worshippers. These idols form the obstacle
that impedeth man in his efforts to advance in the path of perfection. (TB LD)

Let them that bear
allegiance to this Wronged One be even as a raining cloud in moments of
charity and benevolence and as a blazing fire in restraining their base
and appetitive natures. (TB LD)

Were man to appreciate the greatness of his station and the loftiness of
his destiny he would manifest naught save goodly character, pure deeds,
and a seemly and praiseworthy conduct. (TB LM)

Likewise, reflect upon the perfection of man’s creation, and that all
these planes and states are folded up and hidden away within him.

  Dost thou reckon thyself only a puny form
  When within thee the universe is folded?(59)

Then we must labor to destroy the animal condition, till the meaning of
humanity shall come to light. (TSV)

God hath prescribed unto every one the duty of teaching His Cause. Whoever
ariseth to discharge this duty, must needs, ere he proclaimeth His
Message, adorn himself with the ornament of an upright and praiseworthy
character, so that his words may attract the hearts of such as are
receptive to his call. Without it, he can never hope to influence his
hearers. (G CLVIII)


CHARITY

Charity is pleasing and praiseworthy in the sight of God and is regarded
as a prince among goodly deeds. Consider ye and call to mind that which
the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’án: ‘They prefer them before
themselves, though poverty be their own lot. And with such as are
preserved from their own covetousness shall it be well.’(17) Viewed in
this light, the blessed utterance above is, in truth, the day-star of
utterances. Blessed is he who preferreth his brother before himself.
Verily, such a man is reckoned, by virtue of the Will of God, the
All-Knowing, the All-Wise, with the people of Bahá who dwell in the
Crimson Ark. (TB KF)


CHASTITY
Beware lest the desires of the flesh and of a corrupt inclination provoke
divisions among you. Be ye as the fingers of one hand, the members of one
body. Thus counselleth you the Pen of Revelation, if ye be of them that
believe. (G LXXII)


CLEANLINESS

The choice of clothing and the cut of the beard and its dressing are left
to the discretion of men. But beware, O people, lest ye make yourselves
the playthings of the ignorant. (TB BI)


CONSULTATION (and deliberation)

The Great Being saith: The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with the
two luminaries of consultation and compassion. Take ye counsel together in
all matters, inasmuch as consultation is the lamp of guidance which
leadeth the way, and is the bestower of understanding. (TB)


CONTENTMENT

Although to outward view, the wayfarers in this Valley [Contentment]
may dwell upon the dust, yet inwardly they are throned in the heights
of mystic meaning; they eat of the endless bounties of inner
significances, and drink of the delicate wines of the spirit. (TSV)

[re: the "true seeker"] He should be
content with little, and be freed from all inordinate desire. (G CXXV)


COURAGE

Valiant acts will
ensure the triumph of this Cause, and a saintly character will reinforce
its power. (TB LD)

The source of courage and power is the promotion of the Word of God, and
steadfastness in His Love. (TB AL)


COURTESY

O people of God! I admonish you to observe courtesy, for above all else it
is the prince of virtues. Well is it with him who is illumined with the
light of courtesy and is attired with the vesture of uprightness. Whoso is
endued with courtesy hath indeed attained a sublime station. It is hoped
that this Wronged One and everyone else may be enabled to acquire it, hold
fast unto it, observe it, and fix our gaze upon it. (TB LD)

Hold ye fast unto refinement under all conditions, that your eyes may
be preserved from beholding what is repugnant both to your own selves
and to the dwellers of Paradise. (KA)


CREATIVITY

That which traineth the world is Justice, for it is
upheld by two pillars, reward and punishment. These two pillars are the
sources of life to the world. Inasmuch as for each day there is a new
problem and for every problem an expedient solution, such affairs should
be referred to the Ministers of the House of Justice that they may act
according to the needs and requirements of the time. They that, for the
sake of God, arise to serve His Cause, are the recipients of divine
inspiration from the unseen Kingdom. (TB BI)

Nature in its essence is the embodiment of My Name, the Maker, the
Creator. Its manifestations are diversified by varying causes, and in this
diversity there are signs for men of discernment. Nature is God’s Will and
is its expression in and through the contingent world. (TB LH)


DETACHMENT (and resignation)

O SON OF MAN! If adversity befall thee not in My path, how canst thou walk
in the ways of them that are content with My pleasure? If trials afflict
thee not in thy longing to meet Me, how wilt thou attain the light in thy
love for My beauty? (HW-A 50)

O SON OF MAN! My calamity is My providence, outwardly it is fire and
vengeance, but inwardly it is light and mercy. Hasten thereunto that thou
mayest become an eternal light and an immortal spirit. This is My command
unto thee, do thou observe it. (HW-A 51)

The essence of detachment is for man to turn his face towards the courts
of the Lord, to enter His Presence, behold His Countenance, and stand as
witness before Him. (TB AK)

Piety and detachment are
even as two most great luminaries of the heaven of teaching. (TB O)

Astonishment here is highly prized, and utter poverty essential. Wherefore
hath it been said, “Poverty is My pride.”(132) And again: “God hath a
people beneath the dome of glory, whom He hideth in the clothing of
radiant poverty.”(133) These are they who see with His eyes, hear with His
ears, as it is written in the well-known tradition. (TSV FV)

[The true seeker] must so cleanse his heart that no remnant of either
love or hate may linger therein, lest that love blindly incline him to
error, or that hate repel him away from the truth. Even as thou dost
witness in this Day how most of the people, because of such love and
hate, are bereft of the immortal Face, have strayed far from the
Embodiments of the Divine mysteries, and, shepherdless, are roaming
through the wilderness of oblivion and error. (G CXXV)

Pay thou no heed to the humiliation to which the loved ones of God have in
this Day been subjected. This humiliation is the pride and glory of all
temporal honor and worldly elevation. What greater honor can be imagined (G CXL)

Ye are even
as the bird which soareth, with the full force of its mighty wings and
with complete and joyous confidence, through the immensity of the heavens,
until, impelled to satisfy its hunger, it turneth longingly to the water
and clay of the earth below it, and, having been entrapped in the mesh of
its desire, findeth itself impotent to resume its flight to the realms
whence it came. Powerless to shake off the burden weighing on its sullied
wings, that bird, hitherto an inmate of the heavens, is now forced to seek
a dwelling-place upon the dust. Wherefore, O My servants, defile not your
wings with the clay of waywardness and vain desires, and suffer them not
to be stained with the dust of envy and hate, that ye may not be hindered
from soaring in the heavens of My divine knowledge. (G CLIII)

By My life! Neither the
pomp of the mighty, nor the wealth of the rich, nor even the ascendancy of
the ungodly will endure. All will perish, at a word from Him. (KA)

Lament not in your hours of trial, neither rejoice therein; seek ye the
Middle Way which is the remembrance of Me in your afflictions and
reflection over that which may befall you in future. (KA)

Regard the afflictions endured in the path of God as comfort
itself. Every affliction suffered for His sake is a potent remedy,
every bitterness is naught but sweetness and every abasement an
exaltation. (TU 3.7)


DETACHMENT (from material things)

O SON OF BEING! Busy not thyself with this world, for with fire We test
the gold, and with gold We test Our servants. (HW-A 55)

O MY SERVANT! Free thyself from the fetters of this world, and loose thy
soul from the prison of self. Seize thy chance, for it will come to thee
no more. (HW-P 40)

If the whole earth were to be converted
into silver and gold, no man who can be said to have truly ascended into
the heaven of faith and certitude would deign to regard it, much less to
seize and keep it. (G CXXXVII)

The world and its vanities, and its glory,
and whatever delights it can offer, are all, in the sight of God, as
worthless as, nay, even more contemptible than, dust and ashes. Would that
the hearts of men could comprehend it! (G CXXXIX)

The things of the
earth ill beseem you. Cast them away unto such as may desire them, and
fasten your eyes upon this most holy and effulgent Vision. (G CXXXIX)

Rejoice not in the things ye possess; tonight they are yours,
tomorrow others will possess them. (KA)


AVOIDANCE OF DISPUTATION

O SON OF DUST! Verily I say unto thee: Of all men the most negligent is he
that disputeth idly and seeketh to advance himself over his brother. Say,
O brethren! Let deeds, not words, be your adorning. (HW-P 5)

71 O people! Dispute not concerning My Cause, for ye shall never fathom
the manifold wisdom of your Lord, nor shall ye ever gauge the knowledge of
Him Who is the All-Glorious, the All-Pervading. Whosoever layeth claim to
have known His Essence is without doubt among the most ignorant of all
people. Every atom in the universe would charge such a man with imposture,
and to this beareth witness My tongue which speaketh naught but the truth. (SLH SH)


DUTY

O SON OF SPIRIT! My claim on thee is great, it cannot be forgotten. My
grace to thee is plenteous, it cannot be veiled. My love has made in thee
its home, it cannot be concealed. My light is manifest to thee, it cannot
be obscured. (HW-A 20)

O SON OF MAN! Many a day hath passed over thee whilst thou hast busied
thyself with thy fancies and idle imaginings. How long art thou to slumber
on thy bed? Lift up thy head from slumber, for the Sun hath risen to the
zenith, haply it may shine upon thee with the light of beauty. (HW-A 62)

O MY SERVANTS! Ye are the trees of My garden; ye must give forth goodly
and wondrous fruits, that ye yourselves and others may profit therefrom.
Thus it is incumbent on every one to engage in crafts and professions, for
therein lies the secret of wealth, O men of understanding! For results
depend upon means, and the grace of God shall be all-sufficient unto you.
Trees that yield no fruit have been and will ever be for the fire. (HW-P 80)

It is enjoined upon every one of you to engage in some form of occupation,
such as crafts, trades and the like. We have graciously exalted your
engagement in such work to the rank of worship unto God, the True One. (TB BI)


EDUCATION (spiritual and otherwise)

The Pen of Glory counselleth everyone regarding the instruction and
education of children. Behold that which the Will of God hath revealed
upon Our arrival in the Prison City and recorded in the Most Holy
Book.(48) Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son
and daughter in the art of reading and writing and in all that hath been
laid down in the Holy Tablet. (TB IS)

Man is the supreme Talisman. Lack of a proper education hath, however,
deprived him of that which he doth inherently possess. (TB LM)

Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value. Education
can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to
benefit therefrom. (TB LM)

At the outset of every endeavour, it is incumbent to look to the end of
it. Of all the arts and sciences, set the children to studying those which
will result in advantage to man, will ensure his progress and elevate his
rank. (TB LM)

The learned of the day must direct the people to
acquire those branches of knowledge which are of use, that both the
learned themselves and the generality of mankind may derive benefits
therefrom. Such academic pursuits as begin and end in words alone have
never been and will never be of any worth. The majority of Persia’s
learned doctors devote all their lives to the study of a philosophy the
ultimate yield of which is nothing but words. (TB LM)


EXCELLENCE (esp. education and arts)

It is permissible to study sciences and arts, but such sciences as are
useful and would redound to the progress and advancement of the people. (IB BI)

The first Taráz and the first effulgence which hath dawned from the
horizon of the Mother Book is that man should know his own self and
recognize that which leadeth unto loftiness or lowliness, glory or
abasement, wealth or poverty. Having attained the stage of fulfilment and
reached his maturity, man standeth in need of wealth, and such wealth as
he acquireth through crafts or professions is commendable and praiseworthy
in the estimation of men of wisdom, and especially in the eyes of servants
who dedicate themselves to the education of the world and to the
edification of its peoples. (TB TA)

In this Day the sun of craftsmanship shineth above the horizon of the
occident and the river of arts is flowing out of the sea of that region.
One must speak with fairness and appreciate such bounty. (TB TA)

Great indeed is the claim of
scientists and craftsmen on the peoples of the world. Unto this beareth
witness the Mother Book on the day of His return. (TB TJ)


FAIRNESS

Tell, O ‘Alí, the loved ones of God that equity is the most fundamental
among human virtues. The evaluation of all things must needs depend upon
it. (G C)

FAITH (as in, keeping of Faith)

The essence of faith is fewness of words and abundance of deeds; he whose
words exceed his deeds, know verily his death is better than his life. (TB AL)


FEAR OF GOD

... that which guardeth and restraineth man both outwardly and
inwardly hath been and still is the fear of God. It is man’s true
protector and his spiritual guardian. It behoveth him to cleave
tenaciously unto that which will lead to the appearance of this
supreme bounty. (TB LD)

O Jalíl! Admonish men to fear God. By God! This fear is the chief
commander of the army of thy Lord. Its hosts are a praiseworthy character
and goodly deeds. Through it have the cities of men’s hearts been opened
throughout the ages and centuries, and the standards of ascendancy and
triumph raised above all other standards. (TB IS)

In this Revelation the hosts that can render it victorious are the hosts
of praiseworthy deeds and upright character. The leader and commander of
these hosts hath ever been the fear of God, a fear that encompasseth all
things and reigneth over all things. (TB IQ)

The essence of wisdom is the fear of God, the dread of His scourge and
punishment, and the apprehension of His justice and decree. (TB AK)

Know thou for a certainty that whoso disbelieveth in God is neither
trustworthy nor truthful. This, indeed, is the truth, the undoubted truth.
He that acteth treacherously towards God will, also, act treacherously
towards his king. (G CXIV)


FRIENDSHIP

O FRIEND! In the garden of thy heart plant naught but the rose of love,
and from the nightingale of affection and desire loosen not thy hold.
Treasure the companionship of the righteous and eschew all fellowship with
the ungodly. (HW-P 3)

O people! Consort with the followers of
all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship. (TB BI)

They that are endued with sincerity and faithfulness should associate with
all the peoples and kindreds of the earth with joy and radiance, inasmuch
as consorting with people hath promoted and will continue to promote unity
and concord, which in turn are conducive to the maintenance of order in
the world and to the regeneration of nations. Blessed are such as hold
fast to the cord of kindliness and tender mercy and are free from
animosity and hatred. (...)

This Wronged One exhorteth the peoples of the world to observe tolerance
and righteousness, which are two lights amidst the darkness of the world
and two educators for the edification of mankind. Happy are they who have
attained thereto and woe betide the heedless. (TB TA)



GENEROSITY

O SON OF MAN! Bestow My wealth upon My poor, that in heaven thou mayest
draw from stores of unfading splendor and treasures of imperishable glory.
(HW-A 57)

O CHILDREN OF DUST! Tell the rich of the midnight sighing of the poor,
lest heedlessness lead them into the path of destruction, and deprive them
of the Tree of Wealth. To give and to be generous are attributes of Mine;
well is it with him that adorneth himself with My virtues. (HW-P 49)

O YE THAT PRIDE YOURSELVES ON MORTAL RICHES! Know ye in truth that wealth
is a mighty barrier between the seeker and his desire, the lover and his
beloved. The rich, but for a few, shall in no wise attain the court of His
presence nor enter the city of content and resignation. Well is it then
with him, who, being rich, is not hindered by his riches from the eternal
kingdom, nor deprived by them of imperishable dominion. By the Most Great
Name! The splendor of such a wealthy man shall illuminate the dwellers of
heaven even as the sun enlightens the people of the earth! (HW-P 53)

O YE RICH ONES ON EARTH! The poor in your midst are My trust; guard ye My
trust, and be not intent only on your own ease. (HW-P 54)

The beginning of magnanimity is when man expendeth his wealth on himself,
on his family and on the poor among his brethren in his Faith. (TB AL)


GRATITUDE

O SON OF BEING! With the hands of power I made thee and with the fingers
of strength I created thee; and within thee have I placed the essence of
My light. Be thou content with it and seek naught else, for My work is
perfect and My command is binding. Question it not, nor have a doubt
thereof. (HW-A 12)

O SON OF SPIRIT! Ask not of Me that which We desire not for thee, then be
content with what We have ordained for thy sake, for this is that which
profiteth thee, if therewith thou dost content thyself. (HW-A 18)

The essence of charity is for the servant to recount the blessings of his
Lord, and to render thanks unto Him at all times and under all conditions. (TB AL)


HAPPINESS

Living in seclusion or practising asceticism is not acceptable in the
presence of God. It behoveth them that are endued with insight and
understanding to observe that which will cause joy and radiance. Such
practices as are sprung from the loins of idle fancy or are begotten of
the womb of superstition ill beseem men of knowledge. In former times and
more recently some people have been taking up their abodes in the caves of
the mountains while others have repaired to graveyards at night. Say, give
ear unto the counsels of this Wronged One. Abandon the things current
amongst you and adopt that which the faithful Counsellor biddeth you.
Deprive not yourselves of the bounties which have been created for your
sake. (TB KF)


HUMILITY

O SON OF MAN! Transgress not thy limits, nor claim that which beseemeth
thee not. Prostrate thyself before the countenance of thy God, the Lord of
might and power. (HW24)

O CHILDREN OF DESIRE! Put away the garment of vainglory, and divest
yourselves of the attire of haughtiness. (HW-P 47)

O EMIGRANTS! The tongue I have designed for the mention of Me, defile it
not with detraction. If the fire of self overcome you, remember your own
faults and not the faults of My creatures, inasmuch as every one of you
knoweth his own self better than he knoweth others. (HW-P 66)

Humility exalteth man to the heaven of glory and power, whilst
pride abaseth him to the depths of wretchedness and degradation. (TB KF)

They who are the beloved of God, in whatever place they gather and
whomsoever they may meet, must evince, in their attitude towards God, and
in the manner of their celebration of His praise and glory, such humility
and submissiveness that every atom of the dust beneath their feet may
attest the depth of their devotion. The conversation carried by these holy
souls should be informed with such power that these same atoms of dust
will be thrilled by its influence. They should conduct themselves in such
manner that the earth upon which they tread may never be allowed to
address to them such words as these: “I am to be preferred above you. For
witness, how patient I am in bearing the burden which the husbandman
layeth upon me. I am the instrument that continually imparteth unto all
beings the blessings with which He Who is the Source of all grace hath
entrusted me. Notwithstanding the honor conferred upon me, and the
unnumbered evidences of my wealth—a wealth that supplieth the needs of all
creation—behold the measure of my humility, witness with what absolute
submissiveness I allow myself to be trodden beneath the feet of men....” (G V)

[re. the "true seeker"] He must never seek to exalt
himself above any one, must wash away from the tablet of his heart every
trace of pride and vain-glory, must cling unto patience and resignation,
observe silence and refrain from idle talk. For the tongue is a smoldering
fire, and excess of speech a deadly poison. Material fire consumeth the
body, whereas the fire of the tongue devoureth both heart and soul. The
force of the former lasteth but for a time, whilst the effects of the
latter endureth a century. (...)

That seeker should, also, regard backbiting as grievous error, and keep
himself aloof from its dominion, inasmuch as backbiting quencheth the
light of the heart, and extinguisheth the life of the soul. (CXXV)

Say: Would it profit you in the least if, as ye fondly imagine, your
names were to endure? Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! Was the idol
‘Uzzá(10) made any greater by this, that its name lived on amidst the
worshippers of names? Nay, by Him Who is the Self of God, the
All-Glorious, the All-Compelling! Should your names fade from every mortal
mind, and yet God be well pleased with you, ye will indeed be numbered
among the treasures of His name, the Most Hidden. (SLH SH 87)


IDEALISM

Great is the station of man. Great must also be his endeavours for the
rehabilitation of the world and the well-being of nations. (TB LM)


INDUSTRIOUSNESS

To engage in some
profession is highly commendable, for when occupied with work one is less
likely to dwell on the unpleasant aspects of life. (TB LM)


JOYFULNESS

Pride not yourselves on much reading of the verses
or on a multitude of pious acts by night and day; for were a man to read a
single verse with joy and radiance it would be better for him than to read
with lassitude all the Holy Books of God, the Help in Peril, the
Self-Subsisting. Read ye the sacred verses in such measure that ye be not
overcome by languor and despondency. Lay not upon your souls that which
will weary them and weigh them down, but rather what will lighten and
uplift them, so that they may soar on the wings of the Divine verses
towards the Dawning-place of His manifest signs; this will draw you nearer
to God, did ye but comprehend. (KA)


JUSTICE

The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice;
turn not away therefrom if thou desirest Me, and neglect it not that I may
confide in thee. By its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and not
through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine own knowledge and not
through the knowledge of thy neighbor. (HW-A 2)

O OPPRESSORS ON EARTH! Withdraw your hands from tyranny, for I have
pledged Myself not to forgive any man’s injustice. This is My covenant
which I have irrevocably decreed in the preserved tablet and sealed with
My seal. (HW-P 64)

O Son of Spirit! The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice;
turn not away therefrom if thou desirest Me, and neglect it not that I may
confide in thee. By its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and not
through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine own knowledge and not
through the knowledge of thy neighbour. Ponder this in thy heart; how it
behoveth thee to be. Verily justice is My gift to thee and the sign of My
loving-kindness. Set it then before thine eyes.

And if thine eyes be turned towards
justice, choose thou for thy neighbour that which thou choosest for
thyself. (TB KF)

The light of men is
Justice. Quench it not with the contrary winds of oppression and tyranny.
The purpose of justice is the appearance of unity among men. (TB KF)

Lay not on any soul a load which ye would not wish to be laid upon you,
and desire not for any one the things ye would not desire for yourselves.
This is My best counsel unto you, did ye but observe it. (G LXVI)

Justice, which consisteth in rendering each his due, dependeth upon
and is conditioned by two words: reward and punishment. From the
standpoint of justice, every soul should receive the reward of his
actions, inasmuch as the peace and prosperity of the world depend
thereon, even as He saith, exalted be His glory: “The structure of
world stability and order hath been reared upon, and will continue to
be sustained by, the twin pillars of reward and punishment”. In brief,
every circumstance requireth a different utterance and every occasion
calleth for a different course of action. (TU 2.37)


KNOWLEDGE (Pursuit and application)

Knowledge is one of the wondrous gifts of God. It is incumbent upon
everyone to acquire it. Such arts and material means as are now manifest
have been achieved by virtue of His knowledge and wisdom which have been
revealed in Epistles and Tablets through His Most Exalted Pen—a Pen out of
whose treasury pearls of wisdom and utterance and the arts and crafts of
the world are brought to light. (TB TA)

In truth, knowledge is a veritable treasure
for man, and a source of glory, of bounty, of joy, of exaltation, of cheer
and gladness unto him. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in this
Most Great Prison. (TB TJ)

Although it is recognized that the contemporary men of learning are highly
qualified in philosophy, arts and crafts, yet were anyone to observe with
a discriminating eye he would readily comprehend that most of this
knowledge hath been acquired from the sages of the past, for it is they
who have laid the foundation of philosophy, reared its structure and
reinforced its pillars. (TB LH)

Verily, the philosophers have not denied the Ancient of Days. Most of them
passed away deploring their failure to fathom His mystery, even as some of
them have testified. (TB LH)

A true philosopher would never deny God nor His evidences, rather would he
acknowledge His glory and overpowering majesty which overshadow all
created things. Verily We love those men of knowledge who have brought to
light such things as promote the best interests of humanity, and We aided
them through the potency of Our behest, for well are We able to achieve
Our purpose. (TB LH)

Beware, O My loved ones, lest ye despise the merits of My learned servants
whom God hath graciously chosen to be the exponents of His Name ‘the
Fashioner’ amidst mankind. Exert your utmost endeavour that ye may develop
such crafts and undertakings that everyone, whether young or old, may
benefit therefrom. We are quit of those ignorant ones who fondly imagine
that Wisdom is to give vent to one’s idle imaginings and to repudiate God,
the Lord of all men; even as We hear some of the heedless voicing such
assertions today. (TB LH)

The wayfarer in this Valley [Knowledge] seeth in the fashionings of the True One
nothing save clear providence, and at every moment saith: “No defect canst
thou see in the creation of the God of Mercy: Repeat the gaze: Seest thou
a single flaw?” (TSV)

Whoso ariseth among you to teach the Cause of his Lord, let him, before
all else, teach his own self, that his speech may attract the hearts of
them that hear him. Unless he teacheth his own self, the words of his
mouth will not influence the heart of the seeker. Take heed, O people,
lest ye be of them that give good counsel to others but forget to follow
it themselves. The words of such as these, and beyond the words the
realities of all things, and beyond these realities the angels that are
nigh unto God, bring against them the accusation of falsehood. (G CXXVIII)

Verily I say, whatsoever leadeth to the decline of ignorance and the
increase of knowledge hath been, and will ever remain, approved in
the sight of the Lord of creation. (TU 1.15)


LOGIC (and avoidance of Superstition)

It is men like unto Hádí Dawlat-Ábádí(6) who, with
turban and staff,(7) have been the source of opposition and hindrance and
have so grievously burdened the people with superstitions that even at the
present time they still expect the appearance of a fictitious person from
a fictitious place. Be ye warned, O men of understanding. (TB TA)

Most of the
people in Persia are steeped in deception and idle fancy. How great the
difference between the condition of these people and the station of such
valiant souls as have passed beyond the sea of names and pitched their
tents upon the shores of the ocean of detachment. Indeed none but a few of
the existing generation hath yet earned the merit of hearkening unto the
warblings of the doves of the all-highest Paradise. ‘Few of My servants
are truly thankful.’(12) People for the most part delight in
superstitions. They regard a single drop of the sea of delusion as
preferable to an ocean of certitude. By holding fast unto names they
deprive themselves of the inner reality and by clinging to vain imaginings
they are kept back from the Dayspring of heavenly signs. God grant you may
be graciously aided under all conditions to shatter the idols of
superstition and to tear away the veils of the imaginations of men. (TB KF)

We heard that which the person in question hath mentioned regarding
certain teachers of the Faith. Indeed he hath spoken truly. Some heedless
souls roam the lands in the name of God, actively engaged in ruining His
Cause, and call it promoting and teaching the Word of God; and this
notwithstanding that the qualifications of the teachers of the Faith, like
unto stars, shine resplendent throughout the heavens of the divine
Tablets. (TB KF)


LOVE

This Wronged One, rid of all attachment to the world, hath striven
with utmost endeavour to quench the fire of animosity and hatred which
burneth fiercely in the hearts of the peoples of the earth. It behoveth
every just and fair-minded person to render thanks unto God—exalted be His
glory—and to arise to promote this pre-eminent Cause, that fire may turn
into light, and hatred may give way to fellowship and love. I swear by the
righteousness of God! This is the sole purpose of this Wronged One. (TB TA)

The brightness of the fire of your love will no doubt fuse
and unify the contending peoples and kindreds of the earth, whilst the
fierceness of the flame of enmity and hatred cannot but result in strife
and ruin. (TB LD)

If the learned and
worldly-wise men of this age were to allow mankind to inhale the fragrance
of fellowship and love, every understanding heart would apprehend the
meaning of true liberty, and discover the secret of undisturbed peace and
absolute composure. Were the earth to attain this station and be illumined
with its light it could then be truly said of it: ‘Thou shall see in it no
hollows or rising hills.’ (TB LM)

The steed of this Valley [of love] is pain; and if there be no pain this journey
will never end. (TSV)

To merit the madness of love, man must abound
in sanity; to merit the bonds of the Friend, he must be full of spirit. (TSV)


MAGNANIMITY

O SON OF EARTH! Know, verily, the heart wherein the least remnant of envy
yet lingers, shall never attain My everlasting dominion, nor inhale the
sweet savors of holiness breathing from My kingdom of sanctity. (HW-A 6)

O QUINTESSENCE OF PASSION! Put away all covetousness and seek contentment;
for the covetous hath ever been deprived, and the contented hath ever been
loved and praised. (HW-P 50)


MERCY

If thine eyes be
turned towards mercy, forsake the things that profit thee and cleave unto
that which will profit mankind. (TB KF)


MODERATION

In all matters moderation is
desirable. If a thing is carried to excess, it will prove a source of
evil. Consider the civilization of the West, how it hath agitated and
alarmed the peoples of the world. An infernal engine hath been devised,
and hath proved so cruel a weapon of destruction that its like none hath
ever witnessed or heard. (TB KF)

It is incumbent upon them who are in authority to exercise moderation in
all things. Whatsoever passeth beyond the limits of moderation will cease
to exert a beneficial influence. Consider for instance such things as
liberty, civilization and the like. However much men of understanding may
favourably regard them, they will, if carried to excess, exercise a
pernicious influence upon men. (TB LM)


OBEDIENCE

O SON OF BEING! Walk in My statutes for love of Me and deny thyself that
which thou desirest if thou seekest My pleasure. (HW-A 38)

In every country where any of this people reside, they must behave towards
the government of that country with loyalty, honesty and truthfulness. (TB BI)

They that immerse themselves in the ocean of His utterances should at all
times have the utmost regard for the divinely-revealed ordinances and
prohibitions. Indeed His ordinances constitute the mightiest stronghold
for the protection of the world and the safeguarding of its peoples—a
light upon those who acknowledge and recognize the truth, and a fire unto
such as turn away and deny. (TB TJ)

It is incumbent upon everyone to observe God’s holy commandments, inasmuch
as they are the wellspring of life unto the world. The heaven of divine
wisdom is illumined with the two luminaries of consultation and compassion
and the canopy of world order is upraised upon the two pillars of reward
and punishment. (TB IS)

It is incumbent upon everyone to aid those daysprings of authority and
sources of command who are adorned with the ornament of equity and
justice. Blessed are the rulers and the learned among the people of Bahá. (TB KA)

... the traveler must stray not the breadth of a hair
from the “Law,” for this is indeed the secret of the “Path” and the fruit
of the Tree of “Truth”; and in all these stages he must cling to the robe
of obedience to the commandments, and hold fast to the cord of shunning
all forbidden things, that he may be nourished from the cup of the Law and
informed of the mysteries of Truth. (TSV)


"PASSION" (the bad sort)

O BEFRIENDED STRANGER! The candle of thine heart is lighted by the hand of
My power, quench it not with the contrary winds of self and passion. (HW-P 32)


PATIENCE

O SON OF MAN! For everything there is a sign. The sign of love is
fortitude under My decree and patience under My trials. (HW-A 48)

Far be it from us to despair at any time of the incalculable favours of
God, for if it were His wish He could cause a mere atom to be transformed
into a sun and a single drop into an ocean. He unlocketh thousands of
doors, while man is incapable of conceiving even a single one. (TB LM)

without patience the wayfarer on
this journey will reach nowhere and attain no goal. Nor should he ever be
downhearted; if he strive for a hundred thousand years and yet fail to
behold the beauty of the Friend, he should not falter. (TSV)


PEACEFULNESS

Strife leads to
bloodshed and provokes commotion amongst people. Hearken ye unto the Voice
of this Wronged One and deviate not therefrom. (TB KF)

Strife and conflict befit the beasts of the wild. It was through the grace
of God and with the aid of seemly words and praiseworthy deeds that the
unsheathed swords of the Bábí community were returned to their scabbards.
Indeed through the power of good words, the righteous have always
succeeded in winning command over the meads of the hearts of men. (TB LD)

This Wronged One hath forbidden  he people of God to engage in contention
or conflict and hath exhorted them to righteous deeds and praiseworthy
character. In this day the hosts that can ensure the victory of the Cause
are those of goodly conduct and saintly character. (TB LD)

In all circumstances one should seize upon every means which
will promote security and tranquillity among the peoples of the world. (TB LM)

... the actions of man
himself breed a profusion of satanic power. For were men to abide by and
observe the divine teachings, every trace of evil would be banished from
the face of the earth. However, the widespread differences that exist
among mankind and the prevalence of sedition, contention, conflict and the
like are the primary factors which provoke the appearance of the satanic
spirit. Yet the Holy Spirit hath ever shunned such matters. A world in
which naught can be perceived save strife, quarrels and corruption is
bound to become the seat of the throne, the very metropolis, of Satan. (TB LM)

Conflict and contention are categorically forbidden in His Book. (TB KA)

Nothing whatever
can, in this Day, inflict a greater harm upon this Cause than dissension
and strife, contention, estrangement and apathy, among the loved ones of
God. Flee them, through the power of God and His sovereign aid, and strive
ye to knit together the hearts of men... (G V)


PRACTICALITY

Every age hath its own problem, and every soul its particular
aspiration. The remedy the world needeth in its present-day
afflictions can never be the same as that which a subsequent age may
require. Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in,
and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.” (TU
2.5)


PRUDENCE

Be thou guided by wisdom under all conditions, inasmuch as persons who
harbour evil motives have been and are still diligently engaged in
intriguing. (TB LM)

Admonish everyone
moreover to observe prudence as ordained by Him, and in the Name of God
advise them, saying: It behoveth every one in this Day of God to dedicate
himself to the teaching of the Cause with utmost prudence and
steadfastness. Should he discover a pure soil, let him sow the seed of the
Word of God, otherwise it would be preferable to observe silence. (TB O)

Beware that thou allow not the wolf to become the
shepherd of God’s flock, and surrender not the fate of His loved ones to
the mercy of the malicious. Expect not that they who violate the
ordinances of God will be trustworthy or sincere in the faith they
profess. Avoid them, and preserve strict guard over thyself, lest their
devices and mischief hurt thee. (G CXIV)


QUESTIONING

If any of the utterances of this Servant may not be comprehended, or may
lead to perturbation, the same must be inquired of again, that no doubt
may linger, and the meaning be clear as the Face of the Beloved One
shining from the “Glorious Station.”(73) (TSV)


REFLECTION

O people of Bahá! The source of crafts, sciences and arts is the power of
reflection. Make ye every effort that out of this ideal mine there may
gleam forth such pearls of wisdom and utterance as will promote the
well-being and harmony of all the kindreds of the earth. (TB KF)


RELIABILITY

True reliance is for the servant to pursue his profession and calling in
this world, to hold fast unto the Lord, to seek naught but His grace,
inasmuch as in His Hands is the destiny of all His servants. (TB AK)


RESPECT

Respect ye the divines and learned amongst you, they whose conduct accords
with their professions, who transgress not the bounds which God hath
fixed, whose judgments are in conformity with His behests as revealed in
His Book. Know ye that they are the lamps of guidance unto them that are
in the heavens and on the earth. They who disregard and neglect the
divines and learned that live amongst them—these have truly changed the
favor with which God hath favored them. (G LXVI)


REVERENCE (and respect for RELIGION)

Schools must first train
the children in the principles of religion, so that the Promise and the
Threat recorded in the Books of God may prevent them from the things
forbidden and adorn them with the mantle of the commandments; but this in
such a measure that it may not injure the children by resulting in
ignorant fanaticism and bigotry. (TB KF)

They that are
possessed of wealth and invested with authority and power must show the
profoundest regard for religion. In truth, religion is a radiant light and
an impregnable stronghold for the protection and welfare of the peoples of
the world, for the fear of God impelleth man to hold fast to that which is
good, and shun all evil. Should the lamp of religion be obscured, chaos
and confusion will ensue, and the lights of fairness and justice, of
tranquillity and peace cease to shine. Unto this will bear witness every
man of true understanding. (TB IS)

The purpose of religion as revealed from the heaven of God’s holy Will is
to establish unity and concord amongst the peoples of the world; make it
not the cause of dissension and strife. The religion of God and His divine
law are the most potent instruments and the surest of all means for the
dawning of the light of unity amongst men. The progress of the world, the
development of nations, the tranquillity of peoples, and the peace of all
who dwell on earth are among the principles and ordinances of God. (TB IS)


SACRIFICE

O SON OF MAN! Ponder and reflect. Is it thy wish to die upon thy bed, or
to shed thy life-blood on the dust, a martyr in My path, and so become the
manifestation of My command and the revealer of My light in the highest
paradise? Judge thou aright, O servant! (HW-A 46)


SELF-EXAMINATION

O SON OF BEING! Bring thyself to account each day ere thou art summoned to
a reckoning; for death, unheralded, shall come upon thee and thou shalt be
called to give account for thy deeds. (HW-A 31)

Indeed, there existeth in man a faculty
which deterreth him from, and guardeth him against, whatever is unworthy
and unseemly, and which is known as his sense of shame. This, however, is
confined to but a few; all have not possessed and do not possess
it. (TB KF)

One must, then, read the book of his own self, rather than some treatise
on rhetoric. Wherefore He hath said, “Read thy Book: There needeth none
but thyself to make out an account against thee this day.”(95) (TSV FV)


SELF-WORTH

O SON OF MAN! Veiled in My immemorial being and in the ancient eternity of
My essence, I knew My love for thee; therefore I created thee, have
engraved on thee Mine image and revealed to thee My beauty. (HW-A 3)

O SON OF BEING! Thou art My lamp and My light is in thee. Get thou from it
thy radiance and seek none other than Me. For I have created thee rich and
have bountifully shed My favor upon thee. (HW-A 11)

O SON OF BEING! With the hands of power I made thee and with the fingers
of strength I created thee; and within thee have I placed the essence of
My light. Be thou content with it and seek naught else, for My work is
perfect and My command is binding. Question it not, nor have a doubt
thereof. (HW-A 12)

Confession of sins and
transgressions before human beings is not permissible, as it hath never
been nor will ever be conducive to divine forgiveness. Moreover such
confession before people results in one’s humiliation and abasement, and
God—exalted be His glory—wisheth not the humiliation of His servants. (TB BI)


SELFLESSNESS

O SON OF MAN! If thou lovest Me, turn away from thyself; and if thou
seekest My pleasure, regard not thine own... (HW-A 7)

It is Our wish and desire that every one of you may become a source of all
goodness unto men, and an example of uprightness to mankind. Beware lest
ye prefer yourselves above your neighbors. (G CXLVI)


STEADFASTNESS

O MY CHILDREN! I fear lest, bereft of the melody of the dove of heaven, ye
will sink back to the shades of utter loss, and, never having gazed upon
the beauty of the rose, return to water and clay. (HW-P 13)

The second Tajallí is to remain steadfast in the Cause of God—exalted be
His glory—and to be unswerving in His love. And this can in no wise be
attained except through full recognition of Him; and full recognition
cannot be obtained save by faith in the blessed words: ‘He doeth
whatsoever He willeth.’ (TB TJ)

Consider how abject is the state of the disbelievers. They
all give utterance to the words: ‘Verily He is to be praised in His deeds
and is to be obeyed in His behest.’ Nevertheless if We reveal aught which,
even to the extent of a needle’s eye, runneth counter to their selfish
ways and desires, they will disdainfully reject it. (TB TJ)

.. thou didst grasp the significance of rendering assistance unto God
and didst arise to achieve this through the power of wisdom and utterance.
Say: To assist Me is to teach My Cause. This is a theme with which whole
Tablets are laden. (TB TSM)

The reason why the subject of aid and assistance hath time and again
streamed and will continue to stream from the Pen of Providence is to warn
the friends of God lest they engage in activities that would give rise to
strife and turmoil. It is incumbent upon them, one and all, to diligently
seek ways to help the Cause of God in such manner as We have explained. (TB TSM)

Take heed lest the deeds wrought by the embodiments of idle fancy sadden
you or the acts committed by every wayward oppressor grieve you. (TB O)

Should your conduct, O people, contradict your professions, how think
ye, then, to be able to distinguish yourselves from them who, though
professing their faith in the Lord their God, have, as soon as He came
unto them in the cloud of holiness, refused to acknowledge Him, and
repudiated His truth? (G CXXVIII)

Beware, lest thou allow
anything whatsoever to grieve thee. Rid thyself of all attachment to the
vain allusions of men, and cast behind thy back the idle and subtle
disputations of them that are veiled from God. (G CXXXIX)


TACT (& ELOQUENCE, "TEACHING")

O SON OF DUST! The wise are they that speak not unless they obtain a
hearing, even as the cup-bearer, who proffereth not his cup till he
findeth a seeker, and the lover who crieth not out from the depths of his
heart until he gazeth upon the beauty of his beloved. Wherefore sow the
seeds of wisdom and knowledge in the pure soil of the heart, and keep them
hidden, till the hyacinths of divine wisdom spring from the heart and not
from mire and clay. (HW-P 36)

Defile not your tongues with the
cursing and reviling of any soul, and guard your eyes against that which
is not seemly. Set forth that which ye possess. If it be favourably
received, your end is attained; if not, to protest is vain. (TB BI)

Leave ye unto themselves the immature ones
of the world—they that are moved by selfish desire and cling to the
exponents of idle fancy. (TB KF)

No man of wisdom can demonstrate his knowledge save by means of words.
This showeth the significance of the Word as is affirmed in all the
Scriptures, whether of former times or more recently. For it is through
its potency and animating spirit that the people of the world have
attained so eminent a position. Moreover words and utterances should be
both impressive and penetrating. However, no word will be infused with
these two qualities unless it be uttered wholly for the sake of God and
with due regard unto the exigencies of the occasion and the people. (TB LM)

The Great Being saith: Human utterance is an essence which aspireth to
exert its influence and needeth moderation. As to its influence, this is
conditional upon refinement which in turn is dependent upon hearts which
are detached and pure. As to its moderation, this hath to be combined with
tact and wisdom as prescribed in the Holy Scriptures and Tablets. (TB LM)

Every word is endowed with a spirit, therefore the speaker or expounder
should carefully deliver his words at the appropriate time and place, for
the impression which each word maketh is clearly evident and perceptible. (TB LM)

... an enlightened man of wisdom should primarily speak with words
as mild as milk... (TB LM)

It behoveth a prudent man of wisdom to
speak with utmost leniency and forbearance so that the sweetness of his
words may induce everyone to attain that which befitteth man’s station. (TB LM)

Verily I say, the tongue is for mentioning what is good,
defile it not with unseemly talk. God hath forgiven what is past.
Henceforward everyone should utter that which is meet and seemly, and
should refrain from slander, abuse and whatever causeth sadness in men. (TB KA)

Should any one
among you be incapable of grasping a certain truth, or be striving to
comprehend it, show forth, when conversing with him, a spirit of extreme
kindliness and good-will. Help him to see and recognize the truth, without
esteeming yourself to be, in the least, superior to him, or to be
possessed of greater endowments. (G VI)

The Lord of celestial wisdom saith: A harsh word is even as a sword
thrust; a gentle word as milk. The latter leadeth the children of men
unto knowledge and conferreth upon them true distinction. (TU 1.13)

THANKFULNESS

We yield praise unto God—hallowed and glorified be He—for whatsoever He
hath graciously revealed in this blessed, this glorious and incomparable
Day. Indeed if everyone on earth were endowed with a myriad tongues and
were to continually praise God and magnify His Name to the end that
knoweth no end, their thanksgiving would not prove adequate for even one
of the gracious favours We have mentioned in this Tablet. Unto this
beareth witness every man of wisdom and discernment, of understanding and
knowledge. (TB BI)


TOLERATION

The heaven of true understanding shineth
resplendent with the light of two luminaries: tolerance and righteousness. (TB LM)

Warn, O Salmán, the beloved of the one true God, not to view with too
critical an eye the sayings and writings of men. Let them rather approach
such sayings and writings in a spirit of open-mindedness and loving
sympathy. (CLIV)


TRUTHFULNESS

One should not ignore the truth of any matter, rather
should one give expression to that which is right and true. The people of
Bahá should not deny any soul the reward due to him, should treat
craftsmen with deference, and, unlike the people aforetime, should not
defile their tongues with abuse. (TB TA)

In these days truthfulness and sincerity are sorely afflicted in the
clutches of falsehood, and justice is tormented by the scourge of
injustice. The smoke of corruption hath enveloped the whole world in such
wise that naught can be seen in any direction save regiments of soldiers
and nothing is heard from any land but the clashing of swords. We beseech
God, the True One, to strengthen the wielders of His power in that which
will rehabilitate the world and bring tranquillity to the nations. (TB TA)

In this Day the secrets of the earth are laid bare before the eyes of men.
The pages of swiftly-appearing newspapers are indeed the mirror of the
world. They reflect the deeds and the pursuits of divers peoples and
kindreds. They both reflect them and make them known. They are a mirror
endowed with hearing, sight and speech. This is an amazing and potent
phenomenon. However, it behoveth the writers thereof to be purged from the
promptings of evil passions and desires and to be attired with the raiment
of justice and equity. They should enquire into situations as much as
possible and ascertain the facts, then set them down in writing. (TB TA)

Fair speech and truthfulness, by reason of their
lofty rank and position, are regarded as a sun shining above the horizon
of knowledge. (TB TA)

Beautify your tongues, O people, with truthfulness, and adorn your souls
with the ornament of honesty. Beware, O people, that ye deal not
treacherously with any one. (G CXXXVI)

Say: The tongue hath been created to bear witness to My truth; defile
it not with falsehood. (TU 1.17)

TRUSTWORTHINESS

Trustworthiness is the greatest portal
leading unto the tranquillity and security of the people. In truth the
stability of every affair hath depended and doth depend upon it. (TB TA)

We will now mention unto thee Trustworthiness and the station thereof in
the estimation of God, thy Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. One day of
days We repaired unto Our Green Island. Upon Our arrival, We beheld its
streams flowing, and its trees luxuriant, and the sunlight playing in
their midst. Turning Our face to the right, We beheld what the pen is
powerless to describe; nor can it set forth that which the eye of the Lord
of Mankind witnessed in that most sanctified, that most sublime, that
blest, and most exalted Spot. Turning, then, to the left We gazed on one
of the Beauties of the Most Sublime Paradise, standing on a pillar of
light, and calling aloud saying: “O inmates of earth and heaven! Behold ye
My beauty, and My radiance, and My revelation, and My effulgence. By God,
the True One! I am Trustworthiness and the revelation thereof, and the
beauty thereof. I will recompense whosoever will cleave unto Me, and
recognize My rank and station, and hold fast unto My hem. I am the most
great ornament of the people of Bahá, and the vesture of glory unto all
who are in the kingdom of creation. I am the supreme instrument for the
prosperity of the world, and the horizon of assurance unto all beings.”
Thus have We sent down for thee that which will draw men nigh unto the
Lord of creation. (TB IS)


UNITY

O CHILDREN OF MEN! Know ye not why We created you all from the same dust?
That no one should exalt himself over the other. Ponder at all times in
your hearts how ye were created. Since We have created you all from one
same substance it is incumbent on you to be even as one soul, to walk with
the same feet, eat with the same mouth and dwell in the same land, that
from your inmost being, by your deeds and actions, the signs of oneness
and the essence of detachment may be made manifest. (HW-A 68)

Be not the cause of grief, much less of discord and
strife. The hope is cherished that ye may obtain true education in the
shelter of the tree of His tender mercies and act in accordance with that
which God desireth. Ye are all the leaves of one tree and the drops of one
ocean. (TB BI)

In these days it is incumbent upon everyone to adhere tenaciously unto
unity and concord and to labour diligently in promoting the Cause of God,
that perchance the wayward souls may attain that which will lead unto
abiding prosperity. (TB KF)

O ye men of wisdom among nations!
Shut your eyes to estrangement, then fix your gaze upon unity. Cleave
tenaciously unto that which will lead to the well-being and tranquillity
of all mankind. This span of earth is but one homeland and one habitation.
It behoveth you to abandon vainglory which causeth alienation and to set
your hearts on whatever will ensure harmony. (TB KF)

We enjoin upon them that are the
emblems of His names and attributes to firmly adhere henceforth unto that
which hath been set forth in this Most Great Revelation, not to allow
themselves to become the cause of strife, and, until the end that knoweth
no end, to keep their eyes directed towards the dayspring of these
resplendent words which have been recorded in this Tablet. Strife leads to
bloodshed and provokes commotion amongst people. Hearken ye unto the Voice
of this Wronged One and deviate not therefrom. (TB KF)

The sixth Ishráq is union and concord amongst the children of men. From
the beginning of time the light of unity hath shed its divine radiance
upon the world, and the greatest means for the promotion of that unity is
for the peoples of the world to understand one another’s writing and
speech. In former Epistles We have enjoined upon the Trustees of the House
of Justice either to choose one language from among those now existing or
to adopt a new one, and in like manner to select a common script, both of
which should be taught in all the schools of the world. Thus will the
earth be regarded as one country and one home. The most glorious fruit of
the tree of knowledge is this exalted word: Of one tree are all ye the
fruit, and of one bough the leaves. Let not man glory in this that he
loveth his country, let him rather glory in this that he loveth his kind. (TB IS)

The Great
Being saith: O well-beloved ones! The tabernacle of unity hath been
raised; regard ye not one another as strangers. Ye are the fruits of one
tree, and the leaves of one branch. (TB LM)

Such exhortations to union and concord as are inscribed in the Books of
the Prophets by the Pen of the Most High bear reference unto specific
matters; not a union that would lead to disunity or a concord which would
create discord. This is the station where measures are set unto
everything, a station where every deserving soul shall be given his due.
Well is it with them that appreciate the meaning and grasp the intent of
these words, and woe betide the heedless. Unto this all the evidences of
nature, in their very essences, bear ample testimony. Every discerning man
of wisdom is well acquainted with that which We have mentioned, but not
those who have strayed far from the living fountain of fairmindedness and
are roving distraught in the wilderness of ignorance and blind fanaticism. (TB LM)

The fundamental purpose
animating the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests
and promote the unity of the human race, and to foster the spirit of love
and fellowship amongst men. Suffer it not to become a source of dissension
and discord, of hate and enmity. (TB LM)

We fain would hope
that the people of Bahá may be guided by the blessed words: ‘Say: all
things are of God.’ This exalted utterance is like unto water for
quenching the fire of hate and enmity which smouldereth within the hearts
and breasts of men. By this single utterance contending peoples and
kindreds will attain the light of true unity. (TB KA)

The first utterance of Him Who is the All-Wise is this: O children of
dust! Turn your faces from the darkness of estrangement to the
effulgent light of the daystar of unity. This is that which above all
else will benefit the peoples of the earth. (TU 1.10)


WISDOM (and avoidance of Folly)

O CHILDREN OF THE DIVINE AND INVISIBLE ESSENCE! Ye shall be hindered from
loving Me and souls shall be perturbed as they make mention of Me. For
minds cannot grasp Me nor hearts contain Me. (HW-A 66)

O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Guidance hath ever been given by words, and now it
is given by deeds. Every one must show forth deeds that are pure and holy,
for words are the property of all alike, whereas such deeds as these
belong only to Our loved ones. Strive then with heart and soul to
distinguish yourselves by your deeds. In this wise We counsel you in this
holy and resplendent tablet. (HW-P 76)

In this Day whatsoever serveth to reduce blindness
and to increase vision is worthy of consideration. This vision acteth as
the agent and guide for true knowledge. Indeed in the estimation of men of
wisdom keenness of understanding is due to keenness of vision. The people
of Bahá must under all circumstances observe that which is meet and seemly
and exhort the people accordingly.

In brief, dissensions among various sects have opened the way to weakness.
Each sect hath picked out a way for itself and is clinging to a certain
cord. Despite manifest blindness and ignorance they pride themselves on
their insight and knowledge. Among them are mystics who bear allegiance to
the Faith of Islám, some of whom indulge in that which leadeth to idleness
and seclusion. (TB KF)

This Wronged One hath invariably treated the wise with affection. By the
wise is meant men whose knowledge is not confined to mere words and whose
lives have been fruitful and have produced enduring results. It is
incumbent upon everyone to honour these blessed souls. (TB KF)

Above all else, the greatest gift
and the most wondrous blessing hath ever been and will continue to be
Wisdom. It is man’s unfailing Protector. It aideth him and strengtheneth
him. Wisdom is God’s Emissary and the Revealer of His Name the Omniscient.
Through it the loftiness of man’s station is made manifest and evident. It
is all-knowing and the foremost Teacher in the school of existence. It is
the Guide and is invested with high distinction. (TB KF)

O people of God! Righteous men of learning who dedicate themselves to the
guidance of others and are freed and well guarded from the promptings of a
base and covetous nature are, in the sight of Him Who is the Desire of the
world, stars of the heaven of true knowledge. It is essential to treat
them with deference. (TB LD)

The source of all learning is the knowledge of God, exalted be His Glory,
and this cannot be attained save through the knowledge of His Divine
Manifestation. (TB AL)

The essence of all that We have revealed for thee is Justice, is for man
to free himself from idle fancy and imitation, discern with the eye of
oneness His glorious handiwork, and look into all things with a searching
eye. (TB AL)

The man of consummate learning and the sage endowed
with penetrating wisdom are the two eyes to the body of mankind. God
willing, the earth shall never be deprived of these two greatest gifts. (TB LM)

FIX your gaze upon wisdom in all things, for it is an unfailing antidote.
How often hath it turned a disbeliever into a believer or a foe into a
friend? Its observance is highly essential, inasmuch as this theme hath
been set forth in numerous Tablets revealed from the empyrean of the Will
of Him Who is the Manifestation of the light of divine unity. (TB O)

It is clear and evident, therefore, that the first bestowal of God is
the Word, and its discoverer and recipient is the power of
understanding. This Word is the foremost instructor in the school of
existence and the revealer of Him Who is the Almighty. All that is
seen is visible only through the light of its wisdom. (TU 1.2)

OTHER QUOTES OF INTEREST

O SON OF BEAUTY! By My spirit and by My favor! By My mercy and by My
beauty! All that I have revealed unto thee with the tongue of power, and
have written for thee with the pen of might, hath been in accordance with
thy capacity and understanding, not with My state and the melody of My
voice. (HW-A 67)

O YE SONS OF SPIRIT! Ye are My treasury, for in you I have treasured the
pearls of My mysteries and the gems of My knowledge. Guard them from the
strangers amidst My servants and from the ungodly amongst My people. (HW-A 69)

O YE DWELLERS IN THE HIGHEST PARADISE! Proclaim unto the children of
assurance that within the realms of holiness, nigh unto the celestial
paradise, a new garden hath appeared, round which circle the denizens of
the realm on high and the immortal dwellers of the exalted paradise.
Strive, then, that ye may attain that station, that ye may unravel the
mysteries of love from its wind-flowers and learn the secret of divine and
consummate wisdom from its eternal fruits. Solaced are the eyes of them
that enter and abide therein! (HW-P 18)

O MY SERVANT! Thou art even as a finely tempered sword concealed in the
darkness of its sheath and its value hidden from the artificer’s
knowledge. Wherefore come forth from the sheath of self and desire that
thy worth may be made resplendent and manifest unto all the world. (HW-P 72)

... call thou to mind the one who sentenced Jesus to
death. He was the most learned of his age in his own country, whilst he
who was only a fisherman believed in Him. Take good heed and be of them
that observe the warning. (TB TC)

O concourse of bishops! Ye are the stars of the heaven of My knowledge. My
mercy desireth not that ye should fall upon the earth. My justice,
however, declareth: ‘This is that which the Son hath decreed.’ And
whatsoever hath proceeded out of His blameless, His truth-speaking,
trustworthy mouth, can never be altered. (TB TC)

Beware lest the sayings of
the heedless sadden thee. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, and teach the
people with consummate wisdom. (TB TC)

We cherish the hope that through the earnest endeavours of such as are the
exponents of the power of God—exalted be His glory—the weapons of war
throughout the world may be converted into instruments of reconstruction
and that strife and conflict may be removed from the midst of men. (TB BI)

The first Tajallí which hath dawned from the Day-Star of Truth is the
knowledge of God—exalted be His glory. And the knowledge of the King
of everlasting days can in no wise be attained save by recognizing Him
Who is the Bearer of the Most Great Name... True belief in God and
recognition of Him cannot be complete save by acceptance of that which
He hath revealed and by observance of whatsoever hath been decreed by
Him and set down in the Book by the Pen of Glory. (TB TJ)

O God, my God! Adorn the heads of Thy loved
ones with the crown of detachment and attire their temples with the
raiment of righteousness. (TB KF)

The people of Bahá burn brightly amidst the gatherings even as a candle
and hold fast unto that which God hath purposed. This station standeth
supreme above all stations. Well is it with him who hath cast away the
things that the people of the world possess, yearning for that which
pertaineth unto God, the Sovereign Lord of eternity. (TB KF)

That which the aforesaid persons [mystics, certain Sufis] have
mentioned concerning the stations of Divine Unity will conduce in no
small measure to idleness and vain imaginings. These mortal men have
evidently set aside the differences of station and have come to regard
themselves as God, while God is immeasurably exalted above all
things. Every created being however revealeth His signs which are but
emanations from Him and not His Own Self. All these signs are
reflected and can be seen in the book of existence, and the scrolls
that depict the shape and pattern of the universe are indeed a most
great book. Therein every man of insight can perceive that which would
lead to the Straight Path and would enable him to attain the Great
Announcement. Consider the rays of the sun whose light hath
encompassed the world. The rays emanate from the sun and reveal its
nature, but are not the sun itself. Whatsoever can be discerned on
earth amply demonstrateth the power of God, His knowledge and the
outpourings of His bounty, while He Himself is immeasurably exalted
above all creatures. (TB KF)

The fear of God hath
ever been a sure defence and a safe stronghold for all the peoples of the
world. It is the chief cause of the protection of mankind, and the supreme
instrument for its preservation. (TB KF)

The Pen of the Most High
exhorteth, at this moment, the manifestations of authority and the sources
of power, namely the kings, the sovereigns, the presidents, the rulers,
the divines and the wise, and enjoineth them to uphold the cause of
religion, and to cleave unto it. Religion is verily the chief instrument
for the establishment of order in the world and of tranquillity amongst
its peoples. The weakening of the pillars of religion hath strengthened
the foolish and emboldened them and made them more arrogant. Verily I say:
The greater the decline of religion, the more grievous the waywardness of
the ungodly. This cannot but lead in the end to chaos and
confusion. (TB KF)

The faults of kings, like their favours, can be great. A king who is not
deterred by the vainglory of power and authority from observing justice,
nor is deprived of the splendours of the day-star of equity by luxury,
riches, glory or the marshalling of hosts and legions shall occupy a high
rank and a sublime station amongst the Concourse on high. It is incumbent
upon everyone to extend aid and to manifest kindness to so noble a soul.
Well is it with the king who keepeth a tight hold on the reins of his
passion, restraineth his anger and preferreth justice and fairness to
injustice and tyranny. (TB KF)

In the city of justice it is the unrivalled
Speaker Who, in the year nine, illumined the world with the joyful tidings
of this Revelation. And it was this peerless Source of wisdom that at the
beginning of the foundation of the world ascended the stair of inner
meaning and when enthroned upon the pulpit of utterance, through the
operation of the divine Will, proclaimed two words. The first heralded the
promise of reward, while the second voiced the ominous warning of
punishment. The promise gave rise to hope and the warning begat fear. Thus
the basis of world order hath been firmly established upon these twin
principles. (TB KF)

We have formerly ordained that people should converse in two languages,
yet efforts must be made to reduce them to one, likewise the scripts of
the world, that men’s lives may not be dissipated and wasted in learning
divers languages. Thus the whole earth would come to be regarded as one
city and one land. (TB KF)

The purging of such deeply-rooted and
overwhelming corruptions cannot be effected unless the peoples of the
world unite in pursuit of one common aim and embrace one universal
faith. (TB KF)

Wherefore fear ye, O My
well-beloved ones? Who is it that can dismay you? A touch of moisture
sufficeth to dissolve the hardened clay out of which this perverse
generation is moulded. The mere act of your gathering together is enough
to scatter the forces of these vain and worthless people. (TB LD)

Every man of insight will, in this day, readily admit that the counsels
which the Pen of this Wronged One hath revealed constitute the supreme
animating power for the advancement of the world and the exaltation of its
peoples. (TB LD)

Watch over yourselves, for the Evil One is lying in wait,
ready to entrap you. Gird yourselves against his wicked devices, and, led
by the light of the name of the All-Seeing God, make your escape from the
darkness that surroundeth you. Let your vision be world-embracing, rather
than confined to your own self. The Evil One is he that hindereth the rise
and obstructeth the spiritual progress of the children of men. (TB LD)

The summons and the message which We gave were never
intended to reach or to benefit one land or one people only. Mankind in
its entirety must firmly adhere to whatsoever hath been revealed and
vouchsafed unto it. Then and only then will it attain unto true liberty. (TB LD)

Whilst in the Prison of Akká, We revealed in the Crimson Book that which
is conducive to the advancement of mankind and to the reconstruction of
the world. The utterances set forth therein by the Pen of the Lord of
creation include the following which constitute the fundamental principles
for the administration of the affairs of men:

  First: It is incumbent upon the ministers of the House of Justice to
  promote the Lesser Peace so that the people of the earth may be
  relieved from the burden of exorbitant expenditures. This matter is
  imperative and absolutely essential, inasmuch as hostilities and
  conflict lie at the root of affliction and calamity.

  Second: Languages must be reduced to one common language to be
  taught in all the schools of the world.

  Third: It behoveth man to adhere tenaciously unto that which will promote
  fellowship, kindliness and unity.

  Fourth: Everyone, whether man or woman, should hand over to a
  trusted person a portion of what he or she earneth through trade,
  agriculture or other occupation, for the training and education of
  children, to be spent for this purpose with the knowledge of the
  Trustees of the House of Justice.

  Fifth: Special regard must be paid to agriculture. Although it hath
  been mentioned in the fifth place, unquestionably it precedeth the
  others.  Agriculture is highly developed in foreign lands, however
  in Persia it hath so far been grievously neglected. It is hoped that
  His Majesty the Sháh—may God assist him by His grace—will turn his
  attention to this vital and important matter.

  Were men to strictly observe that which the Pen of the Most High
  hath revealed in the Crimson Book, they could then well afford to
  dispense with the regulations which prevail in the world. (TB LD)

In formulating the principles and laws a part hath been devoted to
penalties which form an effective instrument for the security and
protection of men. However, dread of the penalties maketh people desist
only outwardly from committing vile and contemptible deeds, while that
which guardeth and restraineth man both outwardly and inwardly hath been
and still is the fear of God. (TB LD)

O peoples of the world! Forsake all evil, hold fast that which is good.
Strive to be shining examples unto all mankind, and true reminders of the
virtues of God amidst men. He that riseth to serve My Cause should
manifest My wisdom, and bend every effort to banish ignorance from the
earth. Be united in counsel, be one in thought. Let each morn be better
than its eve and each morrow richer than its yesterday. Man’s merit lieth
in service and virtue and not in the pageantry of wealth and riches. Take
heed that your words be purged from idle fancies and worldly desires and
your deeds be cleansed from craftiness and suspicion. Dissipate not the
wealth of your precious lives in the pursuit of evil and corrupt
affection, nor let your endeavours be spent in promoting your personal
interest. Be generous in your days of plenty, and be patient in the hour
of loss. Adversity is followed by success and rejoicings follow woe. Guard
against idleness and sloth, and cling unto that which profiteth mankind,
whether young or old, whether high or low. Beware lest ye sow tares of
dissension among men or plant thorns of doubt in pure and radiant hearts.

O ye beloved of the Lord! Commit not that which defileth the limpid stream
of love or destroyeth the sweet fragrance of friendship. By the
righteousness of the Lord! Ye were created to show love one to another and
not perversity and rancour. Take pride not in love for yourselves but in
love for your fellow-creatures. Glory not in love for your country, but in
love for all mankind. Let your eye be chaste, your hand faithful, your
tongue truthful and your heart enlightened. Abase not the station of the
learned in Bahá and belittle not the rank of such rulers as administer
justice amidst you. Set your reliance on the army of justice, put on the
armour of wisdom, let your adorning be forgiveness and mercy and that
which cheereth the hearts of the well-favoured of God. (TB LH)

For every land We have prescribed a portion, for every occasion an
allotted share, for every pronouncement an appointed time and for every
situation an apt remark. Consider Greece. We made it a Seat of Wisdom for
a prolonged period. However, when the appointed hour struck, its throne
was subverted, its tongue ceased to speak, its light grew dim and its
banner was hauled down... 
In every land We have set up a luminary of knowledge, and when the time
foreordained is at hand, it will shine resplendent above its horizon, as
decreed by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. (TB LH)

Men at all times and under all conditions stand in
need of one to exhort them, guide them and to instruct and teach them.
Therefore He hath sent forth His Messengers, His Prophets and chosen ones
that they might acquaint the people with the divine purpose underlying the
revelation of Books and the raising up of Messengers, and that everyone
may become aware of the trust of God which is latent in the reality of
every soul. (TB TM)

The One true God,
exalted be His glory, hath wished nothing for Himself. The allegiance of
mankind profiteth Him not, neither doth its perversity harm Him. (TB LM)

... We have ordained that complete victory should be achieved through speech
and utterance, that Our servants throughout the earth may thereby become
the recipients of divine good. (TB TSM)

Restrain thou the inhabitants of those regions from provocative acts, from
strife, dissension or aught else that would create trouble. That which is
praiseworthy in these days is the promotion of the Cause. For instance if
those people who pursue certain aims were to dedicate themselves to the
teaching of the Cause, all the dwellers of those regions would, ere long,
be invested with the mantle of faith. (TB TSM)

The sanctified souls should ponder and meditate in their hearts regarding
the methods of teaching. From the texts of the wondrous, heavenly
Scriptures they should memorize phrases and passages bearing on various
instances, so that in the course of their speech they may recite divine
verses whenever the occasion demandeth it, inasmuch as these holy verses
are the most potent elixir, the greatest and mightiest talisman. (TB TSM)

ALTHOUGH the Realm of Glory hath none of the vanities of the world, yet
within the treasury of trust and resignation We have bequeathed to Our
heirs an excellent and priceless heritage. Earthly treasures We have not 
bequeathed, nor such cares as they entail. (TB KA)

Fleeting are the riches of the world; all that perisheth and
changeth is not, and hath never been, worthy of attention, except to a
recognized measure. (TB KA)

... the face of the sun of justice and
fairness is hidden behind the clouds of idle fancy which the foolish ones
have conceived. Therefore it is not to be wondered at that the movements
of the birds of darkness attract attention. (TB O)

It behoveth the people of God to be forbearing. They should impart the
Word of God according to the hearer’s particular measure of understanding
and capacity, that perchance the children of men may be roused from
heedlessness and set their faces towards this Horizon which is
immeasurably exalted above every horizon. (TB O)

The world is continually proclaiming these words: Beware, I am evanescent,
and so are all my outward appearances and colours. Take ye heed of the
changes and chances contrived within me and be ye roused from your
slumber. (TB O)

... for that they move on these three differing planes, the
understanding and the words of the wayfarers have differed; and hence the
sign of conflict doth continually appear on earth. For some there are who
dwell upon the plane of oneness and speak of that world, and some inhabit
the realms of limitation, and some the grades of self, while others are
completely veiled. Thus do the ignorant people of the day, who have no
portion of the radiance of Divine Beauty, make certain claims, and in
every age and cycle inflict on the people of the sea of oneness what they
themselves deserve. (TSV)

God, the Exalted, hath placed these signs in men, to the end that
philosophers may not deny the mysteries of the life beyond nor belittle
that which hath been promised them. For some hold to reason and deny
whatever the reason comprehendeth not, and yet weak minds can never grasp
the matters which we have related, but only the Supreme, Divine
Intelligence can comprehend them:

  How can feeble reason encompass the Qur’án,
  Or the spider snare a phoenix in his web?(58) (TSV)

Surely you are
aware of the fierce opposition of Pharaoh and his people, and of the
stones of idle fancy which the hands of infidels cast upon that blessed
Tree. So much so that Pharaoh and his people finally arose and exerted
their utmost endeavor to extinguish with the waters of falsehood and
denial the fire of that sacred Tree, oblivious of the truth that no
earthly water can quench the flames of Divine wisdom, nor mortal blasts
extinguish the lamp of everlasting dominion. Nay, rather, such water
cannot but intensify the burning of the flame, and such blasts cannot but
ensure the preservation of the lamp, were ye to observe with the eye of
discernment, and walk in the way of God’s holy will and pleasure.... (G XIII)

Know thou of a certainty that the Unseen can in no wise incarnate His
Essence and reveal it unto men. He is, and hath ever been, immensely
exalted beyond all that can either be recounted or perceived. From His (G XIX)

O Salmán! The door of the knowledge of the Ancient Being hath ever been,
and will continue for ever to be, closed in the face of men. No man’s
understanding shall ever gain access unto His holy court. As a token of
His mercy, however, and as a proof of His loving-kindness, He hath
manifested unto men the Day Stars of His divine guidance, the Symbols of
His divine unity, and hath ordained the knowledge of these sanctified
Beings to be identical with the knowledge of His own Self. Whoso
recognizeth them hath recognized God. Whoso hearkeneth to their call, hath
hearkened to the Voice of God, and whoso testifieth to the truth of their
Revelation, hath testified to the truth of God Himself. (G XXI)

Were any of the all-embracing Manifestations of God to declare: “I am
God,” He, verily, speaketh the truth, and no doubt attacheth thereto. For
it hath been repeatedly demonstrated that through their Revelation, their
attributes and names, the Revelation of God, His names and His attributes,
are made manifest in the world...
Were the eye of discernment to be opened, it would recognize that in this
very state, they have considered themselves utterly effaced and
non-existent in the face of Him Who is the All-Pervading, the
Incorruptible. Methinks, they have regarded themselves as utter
nothingness, and deemed their mention in that Court an act of blasphemy. (G XXII)

Having created the world and all that liveth and moveth therein, He,
through the direct operation of His unconstrained and sovereign Will,
chose to confer upon man the unique distinction and capacity to know Him
and to love Him—a capacity that must needs be regarded as the generating
impulse and the primary purpose underlying the whole of creation... (G XXVII)
The purpose of God in creating man hath been, and will ever be, to enable
him to know his Creator and to attain His Presence. (G XXIX)

He Who is the Day Spring of Truth is, no doubt, fully capable of rescuing
from such remoteness wayward souls and of causing them to draw nigh unto
His court and attain His Presence. “If God had pleased He had surely made
all men one people.” His purpose, however, is to enable the pure in spirit
and the detached in heart to ascend, by virtue of their own innate powers,
unto the shores of the Most Great Ocean, that thereby they who seek the
Beauty of the All-Glorious may be distinguished and separated from the
wayward and perverse. (G XXIX)

God’s purpose in sending His Prophets unto men is twofold. The first
is to liberate the children of men from the darkness of ignorance, and
guide them to the light of true understanding. The second is to ensure
the peace and tranquillity of mankind, and provide all the means by
which they can be established... The Prophets of God should be
regarded as physicians whose task is to foster the well-being of the
world and its peoples, that, through the spirit of oneness, they may
heal the sickness of a divided humanity. To none is given the right to
question their words or disparage their conduct, for they are the only
ones who can claim to have understood the patient and to have
correctly diagnosed its ailments. (G XXXIV)

And now concerning thy question regarding the nature of religion. Know
thou that they who are truly wise have likened the world unto the human
temple. As the body of man needeth a garment to clothe it, so the body of
mankind must needs be adorned with the mantle of justice and wisdom. Its
robe is the Revelation vouchsafed unto it by God. Whenever this robe hath
fulfilled its purpose, the Almighty will assuredly renew it. (G XXXIV)

Know thou, O fruit of My Tree, that the decrees of the Sovereign Ordainer,
as related to fate and predestination, are of two kinds. Both are to be
obeyed and accepted. The one is irrevocable, the other is, as termed by
men, impending. To the former all must unreservedly submit, inasmuch as it
is fixed and settled. God, however, is able to alter or repeal it. As the
harm that must result from such a change will be greater than if the
decree had remained unaltered, all, therefore, should willingly acquiesce
in what God hath willed and confidently abide by the same. (...)

The decree that is impending, however, is such that prayer and entreaty
can succeed in averting it. (G LXVIII)

The people of Bahá, who are the inmates of the Ark of God, are, one and
all, well aware of one another’s state and condition, and are united in
the bonds of intimacy and fellowship. Such a state, however, must depend
upon their faith and their conduct. They that are of the same grade and
station are fully aware of one another’s capacity, character,
accomplishments and merits. They that are of a lower grade, however, are
incapable of comprehending adequately the station, or of estimating the
merits, of those that rank above them. (LXXXVI)

Certain traditions of bygone ages
rest on no foundations whatever, while the notions entertained by past
generations, and which they have recorded in their books, have, for the
most part, been influenced by the desires of a corrupt inclination. Thou
dost witness how most of the commentaries and interpretations of the words
of God, now current amongst men, are devoid of truth. (LXXXVI)

O friends! Be not careless of the virtues with which ye have been endowed,
neither be neglectful of your high destiny. Suffer not your labors to be
wasted through the vain imaginations which certain hearts have devised. (G XCVI)

Center your energies in
the propagation of the Faith of God. Whoso is worthy of so high a calling,
let him arise and promote it. Whoso is unable, it is his duty to appoint
him who will, in his stead, proclaim this Revelation, whose power hath
caused the foundations of the mightiest structures to quake, every
mountain to be crushed into dust, and every soul to be dumbfounded. (G XCVI)

That copper can be turned into gold is in
itself sufficient proof that gold can, in like manner, be transmuted into
copper, if they be of them that can apprehend this truth. (G XCVII)

Is it within
human power, O Hakím, to effect in the constituent elements of any of the
minute and indivisible particles of matter so complete a transformation as
to transmute it into purest gold? Perplexing and difficult as this may
appear, the still greater task of converting satanic strength into
heavenly power is one that We have been empowered to accomplish. The Force
capable of such a transformation transcendeth the potency of the Elixir
itself. The Word of God, alone, can claim the distinction of being endowed
with the capacity required for so great and far-reaching a change. (G XCIX)

The All-Merciful hath conferred upon man the faculty of vision, and
endowed him with the power of hearing. Some have described him as the
“lesser world,” when, in reality, he should be regarded as the “greater
world.” The potentialities inherent in the station of man, the full
measure of his destiny on earth, the innate excellence of his reality,
must all be manifested in this promised Day of God. (G CLXII)

My creatures are even as the fish of
the deep. Their life dependeth upon the water, and yet they remain unaware
of that which, by the grace of an omniscient and omnipotent Lord,
sustaineth their very existence. Indeed, their heedlessness is such that
were they asked concerning the water and its properties, they would prove
entirely ignorant. (SLH SH)

It is indeed in Our power to take up a handful of dust and to adorn it
with the vesture of Our Names. This, however, would be but a sign of our
favour, and not an indication of any merit it may have inherently
possessed. Thus hath it been revealed in truth by Him Who is the Sovereign
Revealer, the All-Knowing. Consider the Black Stone, which God hath
made a point whereunto all men turn in adoration. Hath this bounty been
conferred upon it by virtue of its innate excellence? Nay, by Mine own
Self! (SLH SH 90)


GENERAL PURPOSE GRIEF

O SON OF SPIRIT! Noble have I created thee, yet thou hast abased thyself.
Rise then unto that for which thou wast created. (HW-A 22)

O YE THAT ARE LYING AS DEAD ON THE COUCH OF HEEDLESSNESS! Ages have
passed and your precious lives are well-nigh ended, yet not a single
breath of purity hath reached Our court of holiness from you. Though
immersed in the ocean of misbelief, yet with your lips ye profess the one
true faith of God. Him whom I abhor ye have loved, and of My foe ye have
made a friend. Notwithstanding, ye walk on My earth complacent and
self-satisfied, heedless that My earth is weary of you and everything
within it shunneth you. Were ye but to open your eyes, ye would, in truth,
prefer a myriad griefs unto this joy, and would count death itself better
than this life. (HW-P 20)

O SON OF DESIRE! The learned and the wise have for long years striven and
failed to attain the presence of the All-Glorious; they have spent their
lives in search of Him, yet did not behold the beauty of His countenance.
Thou without the least effort didst attain thy goal, and without search
hast obtained the object of thy quest. Yet, notwithstanding, thou didst
remain so wrapt in the veil of self, that thine eyes beheld not the beauty
of the Beloved, nor did thy hand touch the hem of His robe. Ye that have
eyes, behold and wonder. (HW-P 22)

O YE SEEMING FAIR YET INWARDLY FOUL! Ye are like clear but bitter water,
which to outward seeming is crystal pure but of which, when tested by the
divine Assayer, not a drop is accepted. Yea, the sun beam falls alike upon
the dust and the mirror, yet differ they in reflection even as doth the
star from the earth: nay, immeasurable is the difference! (HW-P 25)

O REBELLIOUS ONES! My forbearance hath emboldened you and My
long-suffering hath made you negligent, in such wise that ye have spurred
on the fiery charger of passion into perilous ways that lead unto
destruction. Have ye thought Me heedless or that I was unaware? (HW-P 64)

O CHILDREN OF FANCY! Know, verily, that while the radiant dawn breaketh
above the horizon of eternal holiness, the satanic secrets and deeds done
in the gloom of night shall be laid bare and manifest before the peoples
of the world.

O CHILDREN OF VAINGLORY! For a fleeting sovereignty ye have abandoned My
imperishable dominion, and have adorned yourselves with the gay livery of
the world and made of it your boast. By My beauty! All will I gather
beneath the one-colored covering of the dust and efface all these diverse
colors save them that choose My own, and that is purging from every color.

Consider the people of
former times. What were their deeds and what fruit did they gather? Every
thing they uttered was but imposture and whatever they wrought hath proved
worthless, except for those whom God hath graciously protected through His
power. (TB TA)

Gracious God! It was intended that at the time of the manifestation of the
One true God the faculty of recognizing Him would have been developed and
matured and would have reached its culmination. However, it is now clearly
demonstrated that in the disbelievers this faculty hath remained
undeveloped and hath, indeed, degenerated. (TB TJ)

[regarding a certain famous mystic] ... such men are they whose words
are the pride of the world, and whose deeds are the shame of the
nations. (TB KF)

We have said: ‘My imprisonment doeth Me no harm, nor do the things that
have befallen Me at the hands of My enemies. That which harmeth Me is the
conduct of my loved ones who, though they bear My name, yet commit that
which maketh My heart and My pen to lament.’ Such utterances as these have
again and again been revealed, yet the heedless have failed to profit
thereby, since they are captive to their own evil passions and corrupt
desires. (TB KF)

The unbelievers and the faithless have set their minds on four things:
first, the shedding of blood; second, the burning of books; third, the
shunning of the followers of other religions; fourth, the extermination of
other communities and groups. Now however, through the strengthening grace
and potency of the Word of God these four barriers have been demolished,
these clear injunctions have been obliterated from the Tablet and brutal
dispositions have been transmuted into spiritual attributes. (TB LD)

From the lips of
the members of this sect [Shi'ih] foul imprecations fall unceasingly, while they
invoke the word ‘Mal’ún’ (accursed)—uttered with a guttural sound of the
letter ‘ayn—as their daily relish. (TB LD)

The people aforetime joined partners with God, though they professed
belief in His unity; and although they were the most ignorant amongst men,
they considered themselves the most accomplished. But, as a token of
divine retribution upon those heedless ones, their erroneous beliefs and
pursuits have, in this Day of Judgement, been made clear and evident to
every man of discernment and understanding. (TB IS)

Governments should fully acquaint themselves with the conditions of those
they govern, and confer upon them positions according to desert and merit.
It is enjoined upon every ruler and sovereign to consider this matter with
the utmost care that the traitor may not usurp the position of the
faithful, nor the despoiler rule in the place of the trustworthy. (TB IS)

Regard not the
children of the world and all their doings but fix thy gaze upon God and
His never-ending dominion. (TB LH)

Those who perpetrate deeds that would create turmoil among the
people have indeed strayed far from helping God and His Cause and are
numbered with the mischief-makers in the Tablet which God hath designated
to be the dawning-place of all Tablets. (TB TSM)

Every man of
learning beholdeth thee, and such as are like thee, engulfed in evident
folly. Hadst thou realized that which thou hast done, thou wouldst have
cast thyself into the fire, or abandoned thine home and fled into the
mountains, or wouldst have groaned until thou hadst returned unto the
place destined for thee by Him Who is the Lord of strength and of might. (TB TP)

Art thou happy to see the abject and worthless as thy
followers? They support thee as did a people before them, they that
followed Annas, who, without clear proof and testimony, pronounced
judgement against the Spirit. (TB TP)

Rely not on thy glory, and thy power. Thou art even as the last
trace of sunlight upon the mountain-top. Soon will it fade away, as
decreed by God, the All-Possessing, the Most High. Thy glory and the glory
of such as are like thee have been taken away, and this verily is what
hath been ordained... (TB TP)

Where is he to be found who contended with God, and whither is gone he that
gainsaid His signs, and turned aside from His sovereignty? Where are they who
have slain His chosen ones and spilt the blood of His holy ones? Reflect, that
haply thou mayest perceive the breaths of thine acts, O foolish doubter! (TB
TP)

He did not want war, but those like you desired it. When its fires were
enkindled and its flames rose high, the government and the people were thereby
weakened. (TB TP)

How numerous the oppressors before thee who have arisen to quench the
light of God, and how many the impious who murdered and pillaged until
the hearts and souls of men groaned by reason of their cruelty!
... Was it, in thine estimation, their possessions or themselves that
denied God? (TB TP)

Thinkest thou that thou wilt consume that which thine iniquity hath
amassed? ... The things thou possessest shall profit thee not, nor what thou
hast laid up through thy cruelty. (TB TP)

Being overcome by the drunkenness of corrupt inclinations, the people of
the earth find themselves in a state of stupor. They are, therefore,
debarred from the wondrous signs of God, are prevented from attaining the
ultimate goal and are deprived of the liberal effusions of divine grace. (TB O)

... some people seem to have been seized with epilepsy, others are torn up even
as hollow tree-stumps. They abandon God, the Most Exalted—He before Whose
revelation of a single verse, all the Scriptures of the past and of more recent
times pale into lowliness and insignificance—and set their hearts on lying
tales and follow empty words. (TB O)

The immature wish to put out the light of God with their mouths
and to extinguish by their acts the flame in the Burning Bush. Say,
wretched indeed is your plight, O ye embodiments of delusion. (TB O)

... alas for the wayward who are like unto dried-up leaves fallen upon the
dust. Ere long mortal blasts shall carry them away to the place ordained for
them. Ignorant did they arrive, ignorant did they linger and ignorant did they
retire to their abodes. (TB O)

How strange that while the Beloved is visible as the sun,
yet the heedless still hunt after tinsel and base metal. (TSV)

Reflect, what could have been the motive for such deeds? ... such behavior
can be attributed to naught save the petty-mindedness of such souls as
tread the valley of arrogance and pride, are lost in the wilds of
remoteness, walk in the ways of their idle fancy, and follow the dictates
of the leaders of their faith. Their chief concern is mere opposition;
their sole desire is to ignore the truth. (G XIII)

... having weighed the testimony of God
by the standard of their own knowledge, gleaned from the teachings of the
leaders of their faith, and found it at variance with their limited
understanding, they arose to perpetrate such unseemly acts.... (G XIII)

From time immemorial even unto this day, all the
kindreds and peoples of the earth have clung to such fanciful and unseemly
thoughts, and thus have deprived themselves of the clear waters streaming
from the springs of purity and holiness... (G XIII)

This is the Day whereon the earth shall tell out her tidings. The workers
of iniquity are her burdens, could ye but perceive it. (G XVII)

... when they behold the face of the All-Merciful, their own faces are
saddened, while they are disporting themselves. They hasten forward to
Hell Fire, and mistake it for light. Far from God be what they fondly
imagine! (G XVII)

It behoveth you, O Ministers of State, to keep the precepts of God,
and to forsake your own laws and regulations, and to be of them who
are guided aright. Better is this for you than all ye possess, did ye
but know it. If ye transgress the commandment of God, not one jot or
one tittle of all your works shall be acceptable in His sight. Ye
shall, erelong, discover the consequences of that which ye shall have
done in this vain life, and shall be repaid for them. This, verily, is
the truth, the undoubted truth... How great the number of those who,
in bygone ages, have committed the things ye have committed, and who,
though superior to you in rank, have, in the end, returned unto dust,
and been consigned to their inevitable doom! (LXV)

Is the testimony of those acceptable and worthy of attention
whose deeds agree with their words, whose outward behavior conforms with
their inner life? The mind is bewildered at their deeds, and the soul
marveleth at their fortitude and bodily endurance. Or is the testimony of
these faithless souls who breathe naught but the breath of selfish desire,
and who lie imprisoned in the cage of their idle fancies, acceptable? Like
the bats of darkness, they lift not their heads from their couch except to
pursue the transient things of the world, and find no rest by night except
as they labor to advance the aims of their sordid life. Immersed in their
selfish schemes, they are oblivious of the Divine decree. In the daytime
they strive with all their soul after worldly benefits, and in the night
season their sole occupation is to gratify their carnal desires. By what
law or standard could men be justified in cleaving to the denials of such
petty-minded souls and in ignoring the faith of them that have renounced,
for the sake of the good pleasure of God, their life and substance, their
fame and renown, their reputation and honor?... (G XCI)

122 Consider the pettiness of men’s minds. They ask for that which
injureth them, and cast away the thing that profiteth them. They are,
indeed, of those that are far astray. We find some men desiring liberty,
and priding themselves therein. Such men are in the depths of ignorance.

123 Liberty must, in the end, lead to sedition, whose flames none can
quench. Thus warneth you He Who is the Reckoner, the All-Knowing. Know ye
that the embodiment of liberty and its symbol is the animal. That which
beseemeth man is submission unto such restraints as will protect him from
his own ignorance, and guard him against the harm of the mischief-maker.
Liberty causeth man to overstep the bounds of propriety, and to infringe
on the dignity of his station. It debaseth him to the level of extreme
depravity and wickedness.

124 Regard men as a flock of sheep that need a shepherd for their
protection. This, verily, is the truth, the certain truth. We approve of
liberty in certain circumstances, and refuse to sanction it in others. We,
verily, are the All-Knowing.

125 Say: True liberty consisteth in man’s submission unto My commandments,
little as ye know it. Were men to observe that which We have sent down
unto them from the Heaven of Revelation, they would, of a certainty,
attain unto perfect liberty. Happy is the man that hath apprehended the
Purpose of God in whatever He hath revealed from the Heaven of His Will
that pervadeth all created things. Say: The liberty that profiteth you is
to be found nowhere except in complete servitude unto God, the Eternal
Truth. Whoso hath tasted of its sweetness will refuse to barter it for all
the dominion of earth and heaven. (KA)

... how many those who subsist on the coarsest bread, who take for their only
seat the grass of the field, and who undergo every manner of hardship, merely
to maintain their superiority in the eyes of men! Thus do We expose their
deeds, that this may serve as a warning unto others. These are the ones who
subject themselves to all manner of austerities before the gaze of others in
the hope of perpetuating their names, whilst in reality no mention shall remain
of them save in the curses and imprecations of the dwellers of earth and
heaven. (SLH SH 86)
