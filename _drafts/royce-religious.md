# Josiah Royce: Some Religious and Theological Writings

This post continues the survey of the writings of Josiah Royce
(1855-1916); the last post covered [some idealistic
works](royce-idealism); this will cover his more explicitly religous
works. The final post will be a slight departure, and cover applied
philosophy on ethics and some of the problems of his day.

One reason for my interest in Royce, besides the fact that he is
overlooked, is the fact that he is an idealist. Though I can't say I'm
completely in agreement with idealism (if forced to choose, I'm a bit
of a pragmatist), I think idealism is a good framework to look at
religious problems from. Unlike purely positivist frameworks that
relegate religion to a purely cultural or phenomelogical phenomenon,
an idealist has an actual metaphysical framework for reasoning about
religious thought. If some of it can be aligned with topics of concern
to Baha'is, so much the better.

So this will survey some of his religious works. It must be noted that
Josiah Royce was a product of Protestant America, and his writings
are very much in alignment with its themes. However, as a serious thinker,
he took the other great faiths of the world seriously and looked at
all the faiths for insight. This sets him apart from those you might
think of as theologians, who generally are sectarians first and
philosophers second. This also makes his work interesting to Baha'is -
indeed, to anyone with a universalist outlook on religions.

So, let's begin his survey of religious works with probably his most
famous argument.

## "The Possiblity of Error"

Royce is most famous as both an idealist and a theist. Perhaps his
most famous arguments are those in defense of theism, and of this, his
most inventive argument is what might refer to as the "argument from
error." That is, the argument that the existence of error in the
universe implies the existence of a ground truth that can only be
fulfilled by the existence of The Absolute (and hence, God) in the
universe. This article and the one that follow outline this argument
extensively. It originally appeared in _The Religious Aspect of
Philosophy_ (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1885) and covers an
argument that was central to his work as an Idealist. While this is
what you might think of as mid-career, it is near the beginning of his
serious philosophical work.

This article is by necessity rigorous; as Royce must first set out to
define error to us; e.g., "it must appear erroneous to every “right
mind” that is in possession of the facts. Hence the personal taste of
one man is not enough to define it." You must also prove that there is
error, as skeptics and relativists will claim there is no such thing,
and that it is all a matter of point of view. To do this, he argues as
follows:

    Logicians are agreed that single ideas, thoughts viewed apart from
    judgments, are neither true nor false. Only a judgment can be
    false. And if a reasoning process is said to be false, the real
    error lies still in an actual or suppressed assertion. A fallacy
    is a false assertion that a certain conclusion follows from
    certain premises. Error is therefore generally defined as a
    judgment that does not agree with its object. In the erroneous
    judgment, subject and predicate are so combined as, in the object,
    the corresponding elements are not combined. And thus the judgment
    comes to be false. Now, in this definition, nothing is doubtful or
    obscure save the one thing, namely, the assumed relation between
    the judgment and its object. 

Likewise, errors must be about something knowable; for example, "In spite of
the religious awe of some people in presence of the Unknowable, it is
safe to say, somewhat irreverently, that about a really Unknowable
nobody could make any sincere and self-consistent assertions that
could be errors. For self-consistent assertions about the Unknowable
would of necessity be meaningless." To break this down he classifies
certain sorts of errors that he claims one may make:

1. Errors about our neighbor’s states of mind. These are errors we
agree can be made, due to the fact that nobody ever communicates with
a person in and of themselves, but with their own conception of that
person. There is no "neutral" ground to decide whether or not a
conception is in error.

2. Errors about the natural world. This would seem straightforward,
but is complicated because such errors just refer to expectations of
future experience; e.g. what will happen at a future time? "When I
say, Thus and so will it be at such and such a future moment, I
postulate certain realities not now given to my consciousness." 

He then proposes his solution to difficulties with these two sorts of
errors:

    Either there is no such thing as error, which statement is a flat
    self-contradiction, or else there is an infinite unity of
    conscious thought to which is present all possible truth.

For instance, if you postulate some being as "fully realized intended
objects to the unity of an all-inclusive, absolutely clear, universal,
and conscious thought, of which all judgments, true or false, are but
fragments, the whole being at once Absolute Truth and Absolute
Knowledge," then and only then you can then postulate the existence of
error, since you have a source of ground truth for all errors.

This argument has become known as Royce's own contribution to
mankind's ever-growing proof of deity - the "proof from error."

There is one obvious objection to this argument - the commonsense argument
that an error is an error, duh, and the "Infinite all-knower" is just
a logical possiblity, an elaborately defined construct which hides a
tautology. Royce's answer is essentialy a restatement that proves this
existence by contradiction:

    ... let one try to affirm that the infinite content of the
    all-including mind does not exist, and that the foregoing idealism
    is a mere illusion of ours. He will find that he is involved in a
    circle from which there is no escape. For let him return to the
    position of total relativity and so say: “The infinite thought is
    unreal for me, and hence you are wrong.” But then also he admits
    that we are right, for in affirming this infinite we affirm,
    according to this doctrine of total relativity itself, something
    that is just as true as it seems to us to be true. The opposing
    argument is thus at each moment of its progress involved in a
    contradiction. Or again, let him insist that our doctrine is not
    only relatively, but really false. Then however he will fail to
    show us what this real falsity is. In fact he says what all our
    previous examination shows to mean, this, namely, that an infinite
    thought does exist, and does experience the truth, and compares
    our thought with the truth, and then observes this thought of ours
    to be false, that is, it discovers that itself is
    non-existent. Whoever likes this result may hold it if he can. 

In other words, without having sort of infinite truth as a ground truth,
there is no mechanism for affirming error. Something finite will not
do: "as we saw with this as a starting-point, there is no
stopping-place short of an Infinite Thought. The possibilities of
error are infinite. Infinite then must be the inclusive thought."

The logic seems airtight, but it is a bit like the various
improvements of Anselm's proof of the existence of God: you do it by
defining the existence of something so abstract, it cannot be directly
seen or experienced. Indeed, a broader version of this sort of thing
is what led Wittgenstein to declare that idealism was nothing but
"word games." Such proofs are a bit like the "proofs of existence" you
frequently find in mathematics - not nearly so satisfying as the
"proofs by construction" that show you how to find an object. After
all, proving there is a largest prime number is not nearly so
satisfying as actually producing it for someone.

Still, this is a good place to start, and will give you a good idea of
the idealism that serves as a foundation of his thought, as well as
the sort of thing that earned him later critics, even as he moved on
from these sorts of topics.

## "The Conception of God": Address by Professor Royce

In this unrelated address given some ten years later, Royce continues
to revisit his old work in an anthology on religious philosophy; this
continues by elaborating some features of the divine within his
framework. He starts by noting the exact problems that plague much
philosophical discussion of God - the same one I identified in the
prior writing: "When one conceives of God, one does so because one is
interested, not in the bare definition of a purely logical or
mathematical notion, but in the attempt to make out what sort of real
world this is in which you and I live." Obviously, Royce heard this
objection to his argument for years and was prepared to address it.

He posits that it is not enough to prove some God-thing and then back
out its characteristics from said proof; he rather wishes to prove
something that is defined:

    "I propose to define, in advance, what we mean under the name
    “God,” by means of using what tradition would call one of the
    Divine Attributes. I refer here to what has been called the
    attribute of Omniscience, or of the Divine Wisdom. By the word
    “God” I shall mean, then, in advance of any proof of God’s
    existence, a being who is conceived as possessing to the full all
    logically possible knowledge, insight, wisdom. Our problem, then,
    becomes at once this: Does there demonstrably exist an Omniscient
    Being?

So he starts with the proof of God as The omniscient being - something
that would see the totality of all existence as a whole. Facts would
not come to him in the disjointed recollections of a person, but fully
and completely organized. This being, to know all, would also need to be in
union with all experience. As such, he simply refers to this as The
Absolute. He then proves this being through a restatement of his
argument from error. At that point, he addresses some new points.

First, to explain the "proof from ignorance" (what he called is "proof
from error") it is necessary to truly elaborate on the
definition of ignorance. The first problem is that ignorance is
everywhere - a real knowledge is not the same as just experience
something:

    ... our experience changes with the current states of our own
    organizations, rather than reveals the reality beyond; and this
    reality beyond, as it is in itself, remains unknowable. So far,
    the well-known and popular argument for agnosticism as to every
    form of absolute truth.

In this form, ignorance is simply the ignorance of the philosophical
skeptic. But Royce is not content with this simple definition of
ignorance, but instead proposes a "higher ignorance". Anyone
reasonably educated is familiar with the above - that their senses can
lie to them, that their measurements can be inaccurate, that their
experimental apparatus may be complete. So many would believe that
they could be in possession of the total truth *if only those were not
the case*. But Royce is arguing that we are more ignorant than even
that: even were we to know all of the emperical facts with exact
accuracy, we would still be ignorant:

    You are ignorant, insofar as you desire a knowledge that you
    cannot now get. Now, the knowledge you desire is, from our present
    point of view, no longer any knowledge of a reality foreign to all
    possible experience; but it is an adequate knowledge of the
    contents and the objects of a certain conceived or ideal sort of
    experience, called by you organized experience. And an organized
    experience would be one that found a system of ideas fulfilled in
    and by its facts. This sort of knowledge, you, as human being, can
    only define indirectly, tentatively, slowly, fallibly. And you get
    at it thus imperfectly,—why? Because your immediate experience, as
    it comes, is always fleeting, fragmentary. This is the sort of
    direct knower that you are,—a being who can of himself verify only
    fragments. But you can conceive infinitely more than you can
    directly verify.

So let's assume that somehow you have access to the facts as they
truly are out there - and let's sidestep the fact that quantum physics
means complete knowledge is impossible, and presume that facts about
macroscopic objects are sufficent. You still need an "ideal organized
experience" to explain it all. This organized experience is one that
is accurate within a universal, nonlocal framework; many ideas are
accurate from particular points of view; i.e. many flat-earthers are
"accurate" insofar as from their own very limited point of view, they
find no inaccuracies. Taking a perhaps more realistic example, we now
know more about particle physcis than ever, and the number of
explanatory theories for it has exploded, partly because we have no
known experimental apparatuses to test the theries. So complete,
accurate sense knowledge, even were it possible, would be
insufficient.

Where does this fact fit into Royce's argument? By allowing Royce to
better flesh out his concept of the Absolute as the contrast, a total
organized experience:

    The question: Is there an absolutely organized experience? is
    equivalent to the question: Is there an absolute reality? You
    cannot first say: There is a reality now unknown to us mortals,
    and then go on to ask whether there is an experience to which such
    reality is presented. The terms “reality” and “organized
    experience” are correlative terms. The one can only be defined as
    the object, the content, of the other. Drop either, and the other
    vanishes.


So much for what the truth is. Ignorance is in degrees - one may know
the truth of certain things, yet not see the absolute as a singular
whole. So does this absolute truth exist? "... now, there can be no
such thing as a merely possible truth, definable apart from some
actual experience." If there is truth, than something must know this
truth. And if there is not truth - well, this claim cannot be
proven. Without truth, the claim that their is no truth is but a
provisional statement like the rest. 

Rather than stop there, Royce instead continues, presuming that he has
found a receptive audience. One may doubt this truth, but to accept it
means to accept a certain number of things:

    "People think it very modest to say: We cannot know what the
    Absolute Reality is. They forget that to make this assertion
    implies—unless one is using idle words without sense—that one
    knows what the term “Absolute Reality” means. People think it easy
    to say: We can be sure of only what our own finite experience
    presents. They forget that if a world of finite experience exists
    at all, this world must have a consistently definable
    constitution, in order that it may exist. Its constitution,
    however, turns out to be such that an Absolute Experience—namely,
    an experience acquainted with limitation only insofar as this
    limitation is determined by the organized and transparent
    constitution of this experience—is needed as that for which the
    fragmentary constitution of the finite world of experience
    exists. 

In other words, one it is simply misleading to think that there is a
God and claim we can know nothing about this God; rather, by design,
if there is truth, then God must at the same time be omniscient in
exactly these terms. To think otherwise would be tantamount to saying
there was something else besides God that was itself more omniscient,
a contradition in terms. Likewise, this is not the God of a simple
naive pantheism:

    It is not the conception of any Unconscious Reality, into which
    finite beings are absorbed; nor of a Universal Substance, in whose
    law our ethical independence is lost; nor of an Ineffable Mystery,
    which we can only silently adore. On the contrary, every ethical
    predicate that the highest religious faith of the past has
    attributed to God is capable of exact interpretation in terms of
    our present view.

In such means, Royce fleshes out further his concept of the Absolute.

## "Immortality"

The two lectures discussed above reprise whare are probably Rocye's
most well known argument, but in this author's opinions, these are
neither the most persuasive nor the most inventive. Some of his more
interesting work involves taking seriously certain concepts that have
been either taken on blind faith or hand-waved as "mysterious" by the
more grounded believers. This writing was taken from a lecture given
to an association of clergymen, where once again Royce was using
his idealistic philosophy to move beyond traditional assumptions of
religion. In this case, he takes up what it means to be of the eternal
world and how this reflects upon our own concept of immortality.

    In this genuinely real world of ideal values everything has
    eternal being in accordance with its absolute worth. A value
    cannot be lost, for it belongs to the timeless whole. But the
    ordinary point of view, which so emphasizes time, as most of us
    do, is merely a quantitative view—a falsification, or at least a
    narrowing, of the truth—a transformation of reality—a translation
    of its meaning into the abstract terms of a special set of
    concepts—concepts useful in our human science and in our daily
    business, but not valid for the student of real life.

In other words, the concept of a person being "immortal" as the same
being, extended forever but otherwise remaining of identical
personality, is a self-contradition. For mankind itself, time is an
essential component; strip him of that measure and things lose
meaning. It is easy to think of God as a concept being timeless, and
indeed is the only meaningful conception for Deity:

    To view the Deity as just now waiting, as we wait, for the
    vicissitudes of coming experience that are floating down the time
    stream toward him, to conceive the divine foreknowledge merely as
    a sort of clever computation of what will yet happen, a neat
    prediction of the fortunes that God has yet to expect—well, I
    cannot suppose any competent theologian to be satisfied thus to
    conceive of the divine knowledge of time, or of what time
    contains. If God is merely the potent computer and predicter,
    whose expectations as to the future have never yet been
    disappointed, then he remains merely upon the level of a mighty
    fortune teller and fortune controller—a magician after all. And
    not thus can you be content to conceive of the divine omniscience.

So we have eternety and timelessness, which is the domain of God, and
the domain of mankind, eternally time-bound. No matter what the scale
of man, the actions of man exist in time. What does it mean, then? To
Royce, this is where he revisits his theory of the Absolute, and the
single Will of the Absolute, and mankind's relationship with it:
    
    If we generalize our time experience, so as conceptually to view
    the whole world as expressing itself in a single temporal process,
    our generalization means this: that the entire world is the
    expression of a single will, which is in its totality continuous
    with our own, so that the past and future of our personal will are
    also the past and future of this world will, and conversely.

We, as part of the creation of The Absolute, are part of his will. If
some part of us is to be immortal, it is only as part of growing into
this will. Can Royce think of a reason why The Absolute needs us to
be a part of his creation extending forever into the future? He in
fact does hypothesize this need:

    The highest good logically demands a conquering of evil. The
    eternal needs expression in a temporal sequence whereof the
    eternal is the unity. The divine will must, as world will,
    differentiate itself into individuals, sequences, forms of
    finitude, into strivings, into ignorant seekings after the light,
    into doubting, erring, wandering beings, that even hereby the
    perfection of the spirit may be won. Perfect through
    suffering—this is the law of the divine perfection.

So there is a need in essence. However, this does not that we
ourselves will stay unchanged throughout time. There is no reason to
think of our personality, such as it is, as being static throughout?
In fact, it is not. If we are immortal, it is because we have an
immortality of moving beyond imperfections and error, until at the
limit of infinity we have merged into the universal will.


## "Monotheism"

Here is another theological article, this time for a religious
encyclopedia, that applies deep analysis to a concept most religious
believers take for granted. This argument was one of the most
illuminating to me, and is of particular interest to anyone of a
unitarian orientation, who has thought "if there is one God, how come
the religions can't agree on describing it?" In particular, Royce
concentrates on the monotheism of the great religions of both the
orient and the occident.

In the west, monotheism is usually simply contrasted against
polytheism. About this, Royce wants to consider two important problems
with this contrast:

1. Philosophically, the serious criticism to monothesism has never
come from polytheists. Instead, serious critiques have come from
several different viewpoints, none of which are polytheistic: 1)
"philosophic" panthesism; 2) atheism; and 3) agnosticism,
i.e. skeptical attitudes regarding "divine beings."

2. Defenders of monothesim must define which monotheism they are
defending; in particular, theere are several traditions of
monotheistic belief, and most religions incorporate one or more of
these traditions into their teachings.

Taking this critique in mind, most of the article is spent outlining
three traditions of monotheism, all of which have considerable
religious and philosophical tradition.

1. GOD AS LAW-GIVER. Or, as Royce puts it, "the ethical monotheism of
the Prophets of Israel."

2. GOD AS SOURCE OF CREATION. This is not the God of Genesis; rather
it is the God of Aristotle. As defined by the classical Greek
philosophers, this is the source of order or reasonableness of the
world. Royce refers to this as "Hellenistic" modernism.

3. GOD OF "RELIGIOUS PANTHEISM" AND MYSTICS. The essence of this is
those beliefs that insist not on the sole reality of God but upon the
"unreality of the world." This is the strongest strain of belief in
Hinduism, but also strongly motivated other mystic philopophies, such
as neoplatonism, and western philosophers like Spinoza or Meister
Eckhart.

Royce feels that Christianity draws from all three traditions. The
early Greek fathers of the church certainly drew from both the Israeli
and Hellenistic traditions, but over time the mystic tradition grew
equally as strong. Speaking as one reviewing Royce's work, I suspect
all of these traditions are present in all seriously considered modern
religions.

Another point brought out by Royce is the insufficience of any one of
these traditions. Philosophically, the intellectualism of the
Hellenistic view has perhaps dominated as the most defensible from
skeptics, but Royce insists this God of The Philosophers misses
something vital. Regarding theistic defenses:

    The more highly rational it has become, and the more its apparent
    barrenness, or its inability to combine the various motives which
    enter into the three different monotheistic tendencies has become
    manifest, the more the result of a careful analysis of the
    intellectual motives has led either to the revival of mysticism or
    to a skeptical indifference to philosophical theism. To say this
    is merely to report historical facts.

    Some negative results of the more purely Hellenic type of
    monotheism became especially manifest through the results of the
    Kantian criticism of reason and of its work. It is extremely
    interesting, however, to see what in Kant’s case, was the result
    of this criticism of the traditional arguments for the existence
    of God.

In closing, Royce repeats that defenders of theism must realize that
reliance on any one tradition is insufficient not only for defense,
but understanding. "To repeat, the philosophical problem of monotheism
is (1) In what sense is the world real? (2) In what sense is the world
a rational order? (3) In what sense is the world ethical? The effort
to answer these questions cannot be made by exclusive emphasis on one
of them."

## "The Problem of Job"

In this writing of 1898, Royce, being a good religious philosopher,
tackles the question of theophany. Or to use normal English: "If the
creator God is all-good, how can evil exist in the world?" As in much
of his other religous work, Royce has a unique perspective.

Royce's launching point is the story in the Book of Job. This is an
excellent vantage point to study this logic, as the story of Job is
the story of a struggle all men have:

    The world, for Job, is the work of a being who, in the very nature
    of the case, ought to be intelligible (since he is wise), and
    friendly to the righteous, since, according to tradition, and by
    virtue of his divine wisdom itself, this God must know the value
    of a righteous man. But—here is the mystery—this God, as his works
    get known through our human experiences of evil, appears to us not
    friendly, but hopelessly foreign and hostile in his plans and his
    doings. The more, too, we study his ways with man, the less
    intelligible seems his nature.

The problem of Job is a very particular one, and a very important one
in theophany. Problems of evil are generally answered in very
particular ways. Some will hold that there is no good and evil - for
instance, the "evil" of the natural world, the predators and diseases,
is but a part of nature that is only evil in certain contexts, neither
good nor bad. Indeed, some manmade evils are simply natural rivalries
to be understood and explained away. Another is to acknowledge that
evils do exist, but to assert that all things being equal, is a
natural inevitablity of the world in which sentient creatures exist;
evil exists only because it must exist in some small form in this best
of all possible worlds.

The problem of Job is important because it brings to light the fact
that these attitudes are of little use when the evil is happening to
you. Even if you can take things "in perspective," there are always
some people who encounter great evil, seemingly for the most random
reasons. And if evil must be overcome in one's life, why is it so
ill-distributed among humankind? "If I can only reach a given goal by
passing over a given road, say of evolution, it may be well for me to
consent to the toilsome journey. Does that explain why I was created
so far from my goal?... One justifies the surgery, but not the
disease; the toil, but not the existence of the need for the toil; the
penalty, but not the situation which has made the penalty necessary,

As regards the existince of evil acts by people, one may defend the
presence of evil acts as a necessity of our free will. But why is the
universe such that there should be a victim? Why would God allow the
innocent to be victimized at the hands of the evil?

An alternate solution is presented by Royce's philosophical
idealism. Royce's framework is unsurprising, but he feels that this
approach is a novel way of sidestepping this. This is because it "...
frankly admits that Job’s problem is, upon Job’s presuppositions,
simply and absolutely insoluble. Grant Job’s own presupposition that
God is a being other than this world, that he is its external creator
and ruler, and then all solutions fail. God is then either cruel or
helpless, as regards all real finite ill of the sort that Job
endures." His idealistic viewpoint depends on his view of the Godhead:

    God is not in ultimate essence another being than yourself. He is
    the Absolute Being. You truly are one with God, part of his
    life. He is the very soul of your soul. And so, here is the first
    truth: When you suffer, your sufferings are God’s sufferings...

    The true question then is: Why does God thus suffer? The sole
    possible, necessary, and sufficient answer is, Because without
    suffering, without ill, without woe, evil, tragedy, God’s life
    could not be perfected.

When one contemplates the totality of experience then, suffering
exists because it must exists to complete God's creation. Without
suffering there is no struggle, and without struggle there is no
meaning:

    ... man is not merely setting his acts or his estimates of good
    and evil side by side and taking the sum of each; but he is making
    his own relatively primary acts, impulses, desires, the objects of
    all sorts of secondary impulses, desires, and reflective
    observations. His whole inner state is one of tension; and he is
    either making a secondary experience of evil out of his estimate
    of a primary experience of good, as is the case when he at once
    finds himself disposed to pursue a given good and to thwart this
    pursuit as being an evil pursuit; or else he is making a secondary
    experience of good out of his primary experience of evil,

In a very real sense, evil must exist so that mankind may overcome it,
and that God's creation be fulfilled in this overcoming. Or as Royce
states it:

    To view God’s nature thus is to view his nature as the whole
    idealistic theory views him, not as the Infinite One beyond the
    finite imperfections, but as the being whose unity determines the
    very constitution, the lack, the tension, and relative disharmony
    of the finite world. 

    The existence of evil, then, is not only consistent with the
    perfection of the universe, but is necessary for the very
    existence of that perfection. This is what we see when we no
    longer permit ourselves to be deceived by the abstract meanings of
    the words “good” and “evil” into thinking that these two opponents
    exist merely as mutually exclusive facts side by side in
    experience,

"You can never clean the world of evil; but you can subordinate evil. The justification of the presence in the world of the morally evil becomes apparent to us mortals only insofar as this evil is overcome and condemned. It exists only that it may be cast down."


## A Summary Perspective on Royce's Religous Works

Royce wrote a great deal about religion, even for a philosopher of the
day. It is true that idealists were generally more positively inclined
toward religion that other schools of philosophy; particularly so the
empericists, who were becoming increasingly dismissive of anything of
that nature. But Royce seemed to have a particular interest, and many
of his addresses are to the clergy of his day. This is even in spite
of the fact that he spent little time on such traditionally Christian
imperatives like "proving" the fact of the Resurrection, or the
existence of a heaven for True Believers or the existence of Original
Sin, topics that many more explicitly religious philosphers had vainly
expended so much ink over. Royce's concerns were more universal; what
can we say about the Godhead, given that we have no direct experience
of it, and how should a religious community properly function.

These are the concerns of anyone who is religious, or even "spiritual but
not religious." So from the point of view of this survey, these may not
have been his most innovative and inventive writings, or those that he
spent the most time on. But for any believer looking to expand one's
horizons, they may be the most useful. And if one is still inclined to
look upon some of these arguments skeptically - for instance, with his
"argument from error," a concept I know of no other major philosopher
building on - then these are still of plenty of interest for those
believing religious problems are deserving of original thought.
