## On Sick Societies

Another Baha'i-related post. The impetus is a book I recently read. It is
_Sick Societies_ (1992) by Robert B. Edgerton. It is an anthropology book. The
thesis is spelled out by its subtitle: "Challenging the Myth of Primitive Harmony."

The title implies that this might be an examination of societies that were notably
bad and maladaptive, but Edgerton's aim is a bit simpler. He wished to show
that as flawed as we viewed as contemporary societies, the presumption that the
primitive societies are somehow better and healthier, even perhaps more
ethical is false. Or more specifically,
he challenged the assumption, made by many of the anthropologists of the day, that
all cultural practices by primitive societies are somehow _adaptive_, no matter
how strange they may seem to modern eyes.
In the book Edgerton shows that contrary to that expectation, many such societies
do not thrive and were in decline even before contact with colonial cultures due
to maladaptive behaviors - cultural values so inappropriate that they posed
actual existential threat to the life of the community.

The thesis of this book is simple enough, and given the thirty years that have
passed since its writing, its main points have probably been digested by
the field of anthropology.
I had no trouble at all reading and digesting the contents of this book, which
makes me suspicious - if I'm actually learning something new, there will be some
concept somewhere that I have trouble wrapping my head around, but in this case,
this seemed to be a rather light read, which made me wonder if I was just confirming
my own prejudices. Part of this is I wondered if Edgerton wasn't attacking a
straw man - did anthropologists of the eighties _really_ think all societies were
somehow perfectly fined-tuned, culturally, to their own survival? Did all of the
primitive social mores somehow serve the community, no matter how backwards the
taboos seemed to be? I had a hard time believing that was the case, although Edgerton
certainly had examples of anthropologists attempting to explain away such recognized
evil as female genetic mutilation, human sacrifice and the like as somehow being
"adaptive" responses to the challenges of their environment.

To this end, all Edgerton has to do to prove his thesis is to show that throughout
a variety of cultures, obviously maladaptive beliefs are held by societies which
nevertheless were able to thrive in spite of them. The reminds me of the original
definition of "political incorrectness" used by left-leaning academics in the nineties -
the recognition that however convenient it may be to believe otherwise, sometimes
the instincts of blockheaded conservatives are correct. Educators who realized
sometimes the reason Johnny is bad really is because he was never punished, social
workers with cases where the reason someone was on welfare was because they didn't
want to work; well, add to that the practice of primitive societies that see to be 
cruel, vicious and maladaptive, not because we are incapable of seeing these actions
in the proper frame of reference, but because those practices really were cruel, 
vicious and maladaptive.

Something over half of the book's two hundred pages are dedicated to a recitation
of a broad variety of practices in primitive societies that can plainly be shown
to maladaptive. To draw a parallel to evolution, new traits adopted are sometimes
adaptive and good for the society, but in many case, new traits are maladaptive
and unhealth, but will be carried forward so long as they are not sufficient to
prevent the propagation of society. As maladaptive as many of the practices detailed
by Edgerton are, some socieities still seemed to thrive. However, in the bulk of
cases, he showed that many primitive societies, far from thriving, were actually
seriously hobbled by these practices, and many of the societies that collapsed quickly
upon contact with western civilization were already in serious decline because of
these practices. To give one example from the book, native Tasmanian culture quickly
collapsed upon contact with colonialists due to the fact that the natives in their
trival society were, well, miserable. Completely lacking any even moderately advanced
stone-aged technology and at constant warfare with other tribes, their society collapsed
with hardly even a push - a far cry from other Native American and Africa tribes that
managed to give their colonizers fits. Witness also the mighty Aztec empire, which
collapsed upon the first encounter with Spaniard conquistadors, thanks to the help
of the many enemies they made due to their brutality and practice of picking human
sacrifices from their conquered tribes.

As I said, I suspect that anthropologists, even though being extremely sympathetically
disposed to the societies they are studying, already knew this on some level even
at the time of this writing, and I imagine the field has moved on. It is evident
why the field grew to be so sympetheic to the cultures and values they studied. Early
groundbreaking research by Margaret Mead et. al. showed that many native cultures were
far more advanced than the early jingoistic imperialists gave credit for, and the collapse
of many native cultures was found to have not been due to their natural inferiority,
but due to abuse, injustice and downright murderous behavior of the conquering cultures.
Anthropology quickly shifted from being a tool used to justify subjigation to one
that sought a sympathetic understanding of cultures. Given this background, it is easy
to see why contemporary anthropologists are inclined to take a far more pluralistic,
nuanced view of native practice. However, this fact does not mean that anthropologists
automatically view their studied culturs as perfect. I haven't even studied anthropology,
but one presumes those dedicated towards the study are mature enough to recognize
obvious maladaptive behavior; after all, were anthropologists determined to cover up
such behavior, Edgerton would have had no raw material for this book! 

Unfortunately, even if anthropologists now have a more nuanced picture.
the greater culture at large for the most part seems not to have picked up this
lesson. Health cure ~quacks~ practitioners are quick to hawk ancient folk remedies,
no matter how unproven. New Age movements insist that ancient tribal societies were
egalitarian and nonsexists (they weren't), that their Goddess-oriented religions were
inclusive and upliftin (no again) and emulate what they imagine to be their religion,
complete with a enlightenment-era notions of equality unheard of in primitive
societies. Left-leaning relativists, conflating the concept of "adaptiveness" with
ethical right and wrong, belief mistakenly that the functioning of such societies
prove their is no such thing as moral absolutes. Meanwhile, right-leaning moralists, who should
bristle at such relativistic thought, instead interpret the frequency of common tribal practices of
patriarchy, sexism and conquest as meaning that these should be prominent features
of any society, it being simply "human nature" to have such things. It is evident 
that just because you find a society practicing
something - even if a lot of them do it - doesn't make it right or wrong; and
whether something is "adaptive" may be unrelated to ethics. There
may in fact be no normative lessons to be learned from simply imitating native cultures. 
Unfortunately, the half-learned lessons of "soft sciences" like anthropology usually
wind up entering society through motivated reasoning.

-----------------------------------------------

So this is an interesting book - and one problem with me analyzing it is as of
now I've read
a total of one (1) serious anthropology book - this one. A thirty year old
one. What, really, have I learned? Reading a single book and taking it as gospel
doesn't make me an expert in the field, let alone qualify me to blog about it.

What I find interesting - and what I hope I can understand a Baha'i - are
some of the pathologies Edgerton repeatedly identifies.

One of the more interesting things in Edgerton's writings is his finding that certain
socially maladaptive practices come up in native societies again and again. If there is
something to be learned from the study of such maladaptive practices, is that certain
behaviors which are "natural" are in fact, maladaptive to society. In some cases, they
are adaptive to individuals but not to society; in many cases they are maladaptive to
both individuals and society, yet recur repeatedly among studied societies.

1. _Gender inequality_. Many societies women suffer at the hands of men to a
maladaptive extent. This isn't just the "he never helps with the dishes inequality."
This is more serious. The sorts of things documented include:
 *  Cultures where women are malnourished and have stunted growth
    due to lack of protien, which is all consumed by the men. 
 *  Brutal forms of female genital mutilation. 
 *  An expectation that wives (usually multiple) can and should be beaten
 *  Sexual slavery, and the capture of women in warfare.
Indeed, in some of the societies Edgerton studies, the geneders in the tribe are at
a state of near-constant warfare with one another, with the men's control of resources
being the only thing that binds the two together. 
Inequality between the sexes is common but not always maladaptive. However, in many
of the cultures studied of these cultures, this actually hurt the flourishing of the 
tribe in several ways; the unhelathiness
of the women meant increased infant mortality, medical sterility, suicides by women
of childbearing age and deaths during 
childbirth. This was hardly the only problem;
Edgerton documents one tribe
which died out because they traded away too many of their women of childbearing
age to eager western colonists. The women were only too happy to
leave their miserable lot for whatever the colonists had in store. One could hardly 
blame colonialism for that culture's collapse.

2. _Mistreatment of children_. One of the more shocking findings is that for the
most part, children in most primitive cultures are generally ignored and left to fend for
themselves. This is not the "benign neglect" of our rural forefathers, where
children were minimally educated and fed and otherwise left to sort their own problems out.
This was qualitatively different; the cultures did not view children as an investment, but a
resource drain, and acted in that fashion. No particular effort was made to cultivate 
their development, or even guarantee access to food.
Once weaned, children were often taken advantage of and malnourished. Nor were babies
particularly cared for; infanticide was common. 
Here again, Edgerton is not simply talking about practices that simply seem unfamiliar or unethical
to western cultures, but levels of abuse that are maladaptive, in that they present
a challenge to the continued propagation of the culture in the form of excess
deaths before childbearing ages.

3. _Taboos and superstition_. Anthropologists have long thought of many taboos as
being adaptive - warnings about the dangers of the natural world that assisted the
survival of cultures. Many have speculated that, for instance, the banning of pork
in Judaism (and later Islam) and other kosher laws was intended to prevent the
sorts of serious diseases that come from the improper handling of those sorts of foods.
One can imagine taboos against poisonous plants, animals, disease-causing
practices, and sexual behaviors like incest as being particularly adaptive.
However, Edgerton shows that generally taboos were not nearly so helpful.
Many taboos actually resulted in behaviors that resulted in
forgoing important sources of nutrition and protien, or sexual practices which
actually made conception difficult. Naturally, when antropologists queried the
studied natives on the reason for such taboos, no valid reasons were given; e.g.
"it's the way it's always been done."

4. _Fear of witchcraft_. Scapegoating is a common feature of social life, and it
has been suggested by some anthropologists that the frequent invention of "witches"
is somehow adaptive in that it allows the elimination of "troublemakers". Edgerton
shows through multiple examples how this was generally not the case; instead, when
stressful events happened in the community, instead of a logical search for the
cause, witchcraft was generally blamed, resulting in the search for a nonexistent
culprit. Related to this, bogus pronouncements by "prophets" could sometimes lead
to disasters. He relates one African tribe that nearly drove itself to extinction
when a prophet convinced a cattle-raising tribe to sacrifice nearly all of their
cattle as an atonement for witchcraft. He does not point out, but might well have,
that "wizardry" was not seen as a problem. The fact that perpetrators of evil magic
were almost always identified as women past childbearing age is not surprising given
the maladaptive sexism of many of these cultures.

5. _Persistent warfare_. Anthropologists have had no trouble identifying cultures
in which warfare was not an occurrence - even for those with neighbors in close
competition for resources. Additionally, it is certainly maladaptive for a primitive
culture to adopt a pacificstic stance to a warlike neighbor. So one 
could certainly make the case for a certain level of warfare - or at least, conflict
readiness - as being adaptive. Unfortuntely, Edgerton's review of cultures shows
that more often than not, warlike cultures find a way to make it maladaptive. Many
of the cultures studied live in a near constant state of warfare. Unfortunately,
fighting with one's neighboring tribes seems to be highly correlated with fighting
among oneself. The cultures that fight tends to glorify fighting for its own sake,
making it hard to limit to limit it to those areas where it is truly necessary.
Such cultures commonly lose a measurable percentage of their useful population
each year to fighting - making it hard to keep up the population. 

Reasons for
warfare seemed to have no common thread, though one reason that did seem to come
up most frequently was the capture of nubile young women. One would imagine
that some anthropologists would explain that as adaptive, since a warlike
society would need an increased birthrate. Yet in such societies, the young warriors
were quite blunt that the main reason they took female captives was for their
own pleasure, not to replenish the tribe.

6. _Gross inequality_. The common conception of the unequal society is that early
hunter-gatherer societies were egalitarian, and it was not until the large agricultural
societies that the gross inequalities that characterized these empires came into
being. It is true that in those early societies, there were no _signifier_ indicating
actual unequal rank. However, many of these societies could still be very unequal _in practice_.
If there was any food to be had, the healthy males were guaranteed to eat well, before
any women and children had a bite. Once a tribe was large enough to have a formal
leadership, it was common for those leaders to take the lion's share of any
spoils from hunting or warefare.

Such petty injustices generally were not maladaptive, in that they did not prevent
the society from functioning. Yet the obvious consequence of this was obvious strife.
When many members of a society are miserable, there are a number of ways unhappy members
can fight back or rebel. A chief who makes too much of his privileges is liable to
suffer "rough justice" if too many people are made unhappy. A culture with a series of
chiefs of this sort is one that will expect their leaders to take advantage of them,
with a resulting lack of trust whenever the leaders actually have to ask tribal members
for any sort of sacrifice.

This is not to say that it was common for primitive societies to have all of these
flaws. Any one of these, if taken to the extreme levels documented, could doom a society.
Yet it is rare to find a society that did not show at least a bit of these pathologies.
Edgerton points out that many of these features are common in spite of their negative
cultural effects because they are adaptive to particular individuals. These were features
of society not in spite of maladaptiveness, but because some strong individuals wanted
these to be features of the society.

Edgerton gives several examples of societies that were able to reform some of these
maladaptive tendencies - breaking longstanding taboos to take advantage of new
sources of nutrition, adopting peaceful stances with their neighbors, reducing unequal
social practices and the like. Unfortunately, such reforms were rare, and were
always made at the insistence of a strong leader, who was willing to both sacrifice some
of his own privileges and make other strong members of the society go along with it.
More often than not, cultures contined unchanged, adaptive or not.

What does this have to do with the Baha'i writings? Well, this may explain the
receptivity of the Baha'i message for such people.

A bit of background. Sixty years ago, the Baha'i Faith was a smallish new religous movement
centered around a few hundred thousand believers Iran, and perhaps twenty thousand North Americans
and a somewhat smaller number of Europeans serving as an important and infulential but somewhat 
peripatetic minority. By the turn of the millenia,
most statisticians estimated there were a few million Baha'is, with the majority of the
believers in the developing world; that is, NOT in Iran, North America or Europe. How did this happen?
Mainly through a surge of both missionary work and interest among the sorts of less developed
communities related by anthropologists. The Baha'i Faith had a number of teachings that
were fairly novel for an evangelistic religion. Foremost was a belief system that confirmed
and accepted the validity of their own indigenous belief system. But there were other
teachings that resonated in these communities:

* An emphasis on jusice and equality in dealings;
* Upliftment of the status of women;
* Emphasis on the spiritual and moral education of children;
* The importance of science and elimination of superstition;
* The avoidance of violence and the emphasis on peaceful resolutions to disagreements.

When one views this in the context of the maladaptive behaviors shown by many native
cultures, it seems evident why many who were eager to retain their culture were also
eager to embrace the Baha'i Faith. For every one of these common maladaptive behaviors
identified by Edgerton, there seemed to be a Baha'i teaching aimed directly at modifying
or eliminating the behavior.

At the present, there are several million Baha'is, and with the migration to the
cities throughout the developing world, such solutions may seem less salient ove the
years. But if Edgerton books shows us anything, it's that maladaptive behaviors will
continue to be a feature of societies, as long as there's a significant enough minority
of people who benefit from these behaviors.

-------------------------------------------

Presently in "the West," the Baha'i Faith has entered a long period of slow-/no-growth.
Some have suspected this is due to creeping secularization; others have pointed out
that religious movements (including the Baha'is) tend toward growth stagnation during
periods with lack of social stressors. My opinion is it may be a bit of the former; but
as to the latter, there seem to be no lack of stressors. Nor is there any lack of
maladaptive cultural beliefs. However, identifying the maladaptive beliefs is anything but
straightforward.

The more secular and scientifically-minded will identify their own problems:

* Uncontrolled immoderate extremes of wealth and poverty;
* Short-sighted destruction of natural habitats and wasteful explotation of naural resources;
* Inability of large segments of society to think critically, rendering them 
vulnerable to propaganda and misuse at the hands of others;
* The continuing appeal of "magical thinking" in the solution to social problems;
* The persistence of racial prejudice and tribal preferentialism.

As for the more religiously-minded, we can disregard the beliefs of those purveyors
of nationalistic nonsense whose beliefs should've been discredited for all time by
their defeat in the twentieth century. But that leaves the concern of a number of
believers who believes society suffers from a different set of problems.

* The elevation of paid work to the central concern of life, and a "hustle culture" that
gorifies a committment to paid work at the expense of domestic life and public life;
* The exclusion of spiritual concerns from discussions of public life, and emptiness of
public enterntainment and discourse;
* Excessively individual beliefs that cultivate a culture of shameless self-aggrandizement;
* The unreflective glorification of the weathy as the "deserving winners" of a meritocracy;
* The "prepetual adolesence" cultivated in many youth.

My opinion on this is not that one side is right, and another wrong, but that _they're
both right_.

From the point of view of an adaptive society, a society which is constantly losing people
is maladapted. And indeed, one item of concern to many conservatives has been the 
collapse of birth rates in the developed world. While some have noted that this is only
a problem if there is some _other_, more appealing society which people are flocking to,
this does have an intuitive appeal. Personally, I'd be more convinced if I heard something
from the conservatives more solid than jawboning elite married women to have more babies
than they want. This comment some rando posted on <slashdot.org> says it better than I could:

>  We want babies, lots of them, and we want YOU to bear the costs of raising them.
>  Also we want to skim off the top of the costs you must bear just to have a chance at making them.
>  Also, we still want to overwork you and underpay you and leave you with no life of your own apart from this.

>  Why are you opting out?

To many, a low birth rate poses a problem _for themselves_ and themselves only, but it seems
evident many concerned with low birth rates aren't willing to think deeply about the cause of
low birth rates. Were they to do so, they might find the solutions are things that would require
to rethink some of the values they hold dear. Birth rates are a problem only insofar as they
are a collective good they would like to make withdrawls from. But if your view is that having
families is not a part of life, but instead a privelege reserved for "the winners," and you feel
the only people who deserve to be winners are "your people," then complaining about "the right people"
not having enough children is really the only option you have left.

My own viewpoint is that low birth rates are a lagging indicate of an unhappy society - one
in which there are too few jobs that can raise a family, too few men (and women) who, thanks to
delayed adolescense, are not mature enough to make the necessary tradeoffs to make a marriage and
family work in their prime childbearing years, and too few politicians willing to spell out that
solving pratical roadblocks for family formation like affordable housing and childcare will require
sacrifice from those who would prefer to have lower taxes, an earlier retirement, and a housing stock
that is guaranteed to go up in value.
