title: The Baha'i View of The Spiritual
---
### Abstract

The concept of spirituality is an important one to Baha'is. Indeed,
Abdu'l-Baha says that our knowledge of the spiritual must catch up with
our knowledge of the material. Yet there is no single definition of
what "spiritual" means, and in common conversation it has become a term
so vague as to be meaningless for serious discussions. This paper aims
to distinguish between several different meaning of "spiritual," first
covering popular conceptions in both "Western" religions and philosophy,
and then covering what is meant by "Spiritual" in the Baha'i writings.
The goal is to bring precision and meaning to conversations about
spirituality.

## Spirituality: An Introduction

Spiritual: An empty but uplifting term often found in personals ads.

This, or something like that, was a definition given by a Charles Bufe in
his _American Heritics Dictionary_, a humor paperback that has long since left
my possesion. But the definition has stuck with me, for a real reason.
The term "spirituality" has become a weasel word in society - and vague term
meant to imply upliftment without saying anything meaningful. The dictionary
definition contains many alternate meanings, and a glance through any encyclopedic
reference such as Wikipedia will reveal an unthinkable broad term.

One dictionary definition frames it thusly:

spiritual: "of the spirit"; usually, of or relating to an invisible world.

While technically correct, this rather poorly conveys the concept. We can't
"see" gravitational fields; are they spiritual? Obviously not.

This is problematic when understanding The Baha'i Faith, since the concept
of "the spiritual" is so centrally important under the Baha'i writings. Perhaps
rather than rely upon dictionary definitions, we should allow the Baha'i writings
to define it. If we are to build a spiritual civilization, it would help to
know what it is, rather than just assuming people know what spiritual is - especially
when everyone have different ideas about spirituality due to their upbringing
and life experiences.

## Spirituality - an Introduction

Part of the difficulty in the study of spirituality
is the abstract nature of this term. We can study specific uses of the the term
"spiritual" in the Baha'i Faith to make this term more meaningful. The goal is to
make its use more concrete in discussions, prevent its misuse, and prevent its
mismeasure by materialists who wish to recast spiritual things as a matter entirely
of physical mechanics.

Part of the difficulty of spirituality is the fact so many view exist, and when
someone refers to something being "spiritual," or a spiritual reality, it is usually
embedded in the world view of the speaker.

In fact, this has actually been called out in religious literature as a prominent
void of study. There could be a few reasons for this. One is for the reason that
every sect tends to have their own definition of spirituality. Indeed, it's been
argued by some that spirituality is a "Western" concept forced on other religions -
in spite of the fact the followers of those other religions themselves have no
problem whatsoever describing their spirituality! Baha'i readers will not be surprised
about this universality, but those wishing for a consistent picture of spirituality
will have to contend with the same personal, vague definitions. Meanwhile, those
that sit outside of religious traditions are generally no help clarifying this,
consisting as they are of atheists that are happy to portray spirituality as
either irrationalist ravings or a function of a limbic system placed there by
evolution, or divinity-school academics that only regard spirituality as a sort
of emic categorization of personal religious feeling by their laypersons.

put in a summary of existing (and old!) literature here. Start with
Willam James' work, criticism of this I find uncomfortable.

## Spirituality - A Categorization

So in popular parlance, "spirituality" is thought of as entirely religious in
nature, referring entirely to non-emperical phenomenon, to be upheld entirely
by personal belief and faith only.
Material concerns are thought of as the domain entirely of science. 

### Materialist Views

####True materialists

handle talk of the "spiritual" by dismissing it entirely. Those who wish to keep
the scientific pursuit while acknowledging the spiritual hedge this by thinking
of the spiritual and material as two different "magesteria"; e.g. the study of
material or measurable things is the purview of science only, and anything spiritual
is the purview of the religious.

The underlying worldview of the materialist is that "spiritual" refers to a make-believe
magical world, and spirituality is thought of as being little distinguished from
magical thinking. The "just-so story" told by such materialists is that religion was
an invention by primitive people which was use to explain natural phenomenon. As
the scientific revolution explained more of this phenomenon, spiritual explanations
lost salience, and spirituality is now no longer a valid concept.

This is possibly the most widespread view of spirituality - that of "an invisible world"
which avoids scientific inquiry and therefore may be meaningless. The fact it is so
popular does not make it a religious point of view; it is, in fact a deeply materialistic
point of view. Sophisticated, humanistic conceptualizations of spirituality having nothing to do
with natural phenomonon appeared long before the scientific revoltion most materialists
look towards.

#### Commercial Interests

Where one finds a materialist worldview, one will find commercial interests willing
to make a buck selling people things. And indeed, commercial interests have propounded
their own definition of "spiritual." So there is a fair amount of money
to be made selling items and experiences that simply seems "spiritual." It's easy 
to ridicule businesses that
make money selling spiritual-sounding new age items, but in the general economy, this is
pocket change, and besides, the gentle reader might actually need a prayer mat. Rather,
the great amount of money is made on selling experiences - retreats, workshops, foreign
vacations, a host of experiences marketed as "spiritual" and marketed as somehow good for you,
disguising the fact that these are more or less entertainments. In this worldview,
"spiritual" is any low-stress indulgence that does not involve the consumption of calories.
Perhaps it is the feeling one gets gets when doing something that allows 
one to forget one has a job where they do hateful
things for a living. While few believers give "sprituality" this sort of meaning,
when discussing spirituality, it is worth keeping in mind that due to such commercial
enterprise, the word spirituality now conveys to some people indolence and self-involement,
something that certainly wasn't intended in the original usage of the word.

#### Religious Materialists

There are also religious beliefs that take the opposite view - believing that there
is no invisible world, and that in fact religion takes place entirely in the physical
world.

If one reads ancient myths of the Greeks, the books of Genesis and various myths of
other cultures, there is little appeal to abstraction or invisible worlds. The Gods
were real physical beings, who did things in the physical world. [TODO; when did the
conceptualization of spirituality come into being??] One will look for vain in these
myths for anything resembling a heavenly place free from the material world; everything
being conveyed is stringly materialistic and concrete.

Strict materialists have extrapolated this world view to the religions of today, but
this has also been the case of many sects inside Christianity, Islam and other religions.
In both Christianity and Islam, such concepts as heaven, hell, "resurrection of the dead," 
and "the Day of Judgement" are said to all exist in the physical world. This "religious
materialism" is frequently a sign of fundamentalism; see, for
example, Vahid Ranjabar's talk on "materialistic spirituality";<https://youtu.be/R98AnJ3hDFg>. 
In this case, the religions themselves chose to interpret entities
intended to be spiritual and non-material as having material realities, in
many cases due to a misguided fanatical mindset.
In the worst case, such beliefs have been used to justify opression by religious groups
of other religious groups in the here and now.

An interesting viewpoint is that "scientific religious materialists"; that is, those
who believe actual religious events and phenomenon such as immortality can be explained
with scientific process. Probably the only notable example of this is Frank J. Tipler's
Omega Point Theory, which posits a physical process explaining resurrection and immortality.

### Spirituality as an Unseen World

Somewhat related to this is the more conventionaly idea: spirituality as an unseen
world. To many, this is where many of the things felt as "relgious" exist: God, Angels,
the souls of the Dead, and other sort of beings.
Followers of the all major world religions, with the arguable exception of Buddhism,
claim some sort of belief in this spirit world.

This formulation is so commonplace that it is felt to be identical to relgious belief.
Indeed, when
someone claims they are "Spiritual but not religious," the accepted interpretation
by others is that this is a person who does have religious beliefs, but
has either not formalized a creed or does not accept those of any of
the religions they know about. Such people range from agnostics skeptical of
any spiritual world to people who have invented their own religion with heavily
populated other worlds. Surveys that cite falling religious belief typically
make no distinction between the two.

The views of The Bab and Baha'u'llah come from the matrix of the Islamic world,
and for that reason, it is important to consider the nature of spiriuality in
Islam.
One view of spirituality in Islam is that of an "unseen world" - a world outside of
our own that is immaterial yet somehow interacts with us. And "the unseen" (al-ghayb,
or al-ghiab) is directly referenced in the Koran. The unseen world is described as
something directly known only by God Himself.
This unseen world is populated by beings, just as the seen world is. In the
unseen world, there are three entities: angels, which are immortal and purely
good, devils, which are immortal and strictly evil, and djinn, which are similar
to humans in that they are mortal and may be good or evil.

The Islamic concept of "the unseen" is not limited to such worlds, but includes
other things such as prophecied future events like The Final Judgement and The
Resurrection. As such, it's careful to note that when a Muslim talks about "the
unseen," it does not mean this person beliefs this is something that will not
manifest itself physically. As for Baha'i beliefs, it is clear that any of these
are interpreted as being spiritual; much of this is elaborated in Baha'u'llah's
_Book of Certitude_.

#### Spirituality as Magic

Another word thought to be related to spirituality is supernatural. This is used
in the writings as a synonym for spiritual. The word literally means "not of the
natural world." In such context, it is easy to mistake spiritual for meaning "magic." 

However, there is a distinction between "magic" and "spiritual," and it is important
to understand the distinction. "Magic" indicates a a supernatural power over natural
forces. "Spiritual" does not have that distinction, and it is usually a focus
of one's inner life.
From the point of view of materialist philosophers, the two have an important
distinction as well. "Magic" posits forces that can cause things to happen in
the natural world. It is therefore testable. The existence of "Spirit," on the other
hand, is seen as untestable. Indeed, your more extreme analytic philosophers have
similar skepticism about "The Good," "The Beautiful," virtuous conduct, and a
host of other human concerns we find real but that they find to be undefineable
and untestable, and hence, meaningless.

### Spirituality as Faith

Note that it is not necessary that religion and spirituality necessarily go together.
Some religions are outright skeptical of non-material explanations. Some schools
of Buddhism eschew any discussion of invisible realities. 

One alternate view of spirituality is as a sort of Faith - e.g. a belief in
a claim without proof.

Christianity and many strands of Islam lean heavily on this. Indeed, fideism, the
belief that relying on faith alone rather than on reason is the essence of religion,
is very strong in many Christian sects, and is see as the essence of spirituality.
This is possibly seen most strongly in their belief in prophecy and unshaking faith
in the end times.
This is not just the provenance of peculiar sects in Christianity; where spirituality
is referred to in the New Testament, often it is with respect to the spirit of
Faith seen as important in every Christian believer.

This has an analog in Islam. For some, elements of "the Unseen" such as the
Resurrection of the Dead and The Day of Judgement is said to be to be unseen
because it is knowledge of a future event. Louay Fatoohi in
<https://www.quranicstudies.com/quran/the-concept-of-ghayb-unseen-in-the-quran>
notes that in many cases, "ghayb" is more correctly translated as "matter of
faith. Still, these are considered matters of faith because they are unseen,
and the unseen extends to articles of faith such as belief in the prophets,
belief in divine books, and belief in predestination ("Al-Ghaib", Wikipedia 5/25/2022).
Such religious faith is seen as spiritual due to the belief it cultivates
in believers.

For fideistic believers, this belief can sometimes overlap with beliefs
of religious materialism, producing an impression of a spiritual world that
is something close to magical. In such cases, there is no clear demarcation between
a spiritual world and a physical world. The spirit world _is_ the physical world,
and those with enough faith can see the signs in the physical world.
The skeptical have simply not been able to benefit from the spirit world
powers due to their lack of faith.

### Spirituality as Mystical Experience

One of the most powerful religious traditions is that which thinks of
spirituality in a personal nature. Spirituality is felt by individuals
wishing to bring themselves into God's presence - an altered state of
being where one may "meet God".

Islamic mysticism, which developed during the "golden age" of Islam in the tenth
through twelfth century, more fully developed the sense of "The Spiritual" in Islam.
Many of Baha'u'llah's mystic works presume knowledge of some of these great figures,
including such works as "The Seven Valleys," "The Four Valleys" and "The Tablet of
All Food." This mysticism, as practiced by many Sufi orders, was aimed at developing
spiritual behaviors in an attempt to achieve "union with God."

There is also a powerful element of the mystical in Christianity.
As in Islam, Christianity also has an extensive history of mysticism, and the hagiography
of its saints is filled with the names of mystics who sought the paths to their union with God.
Just as Sufi orders detached from the world in their quest, many Christian mystics found
their path in ascetism and withdrawl from the world. In both orders, "spiritualty" is not
only something that is felt, in one's heart during prayer; it is a life one leads. Interestingly,
when perusing works on such saints, the impression one gets is their main activity is
"being spiritual." 
(Ursula King, _Christian Mystics_. 2001 Hidden Spring (Paulist Press), Mahwah NJ.
The lives of the numerous mystics in both the Islamic and Christian traditions attest
to the fact that spirituality can be an experience as much as it is a thing.

### Spirituality as a Religious State

Overlapping with spirituality as a mystical state is the conception of
spirituality that sees someone as "spiritual" who has turned one's
belief wholly to a cause. In many cases, when the world "spiritual"
is used, one could interchange with the word "religious" or "Christian" without losing
sense of the meaning of the sentence. For instance, the message of Jesus is described
as a "spiritual gift" (Romans 1:11); the goal of the teachings is to bring "wisdom and
spiritual understanding" (Collosians 1:10). But there are inklings of the use of "spiritual"
in a more particular manner; for instance in Corinthians, where spirituality is extensively
discussed:

> All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, 
> another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. There are 
> also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, 
> and the glory of the terrestrial is another.
> There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the 
> stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection 
> of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: It is sown in 
> dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: 
> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, 
> and there is a spiritual body. 

> And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was 
> made a quickening spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which 
> is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, 
> earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also 
> that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
>                                        (1 Corinthians 15:39-48)

### The Unseen World of Philosophy

The question one asks in response to both mystical experiences and doctrines that
point "a spiritual world" is exactly what sort of world this is. In the case of both
Christianity and Islam, a philosophy called neoplatonism seemed to explain the
existence of what seemed to be a real spiritual world that was not detectable with
the senses, and was in fact the dominant philosophy for both faiths early in their
history.

Neoplatonism is an outgrowth of Plato's philosophy. In particular, Plato
felt that all abstract entities existed in a perfect form in some other universe,
and entities in this physical world were projection of this form. To explain our inability
to see these forms, the famous "Cave" analogy was given - like someone who cannot see
actual physical objects in a cave, but only the shadow of those objects, we are forced
to puzzle out what the real nature of objects are without directly seeing them, lest we
make the mistake of confusing the shadows for reality itself. Neoplatonism is philosophy
typically credited to the Egyptian philosopher Poltinus; in practice, "neoplatonism"
was actually a term for the thoughs of a number of Western philophers circa CE 200-500
which elevated the Platonic universe of forms to something like a spiritual world. For
instance, one interpretation attributed to the Jewish philosopher Philo 
conceiving of The One as the creator of this universe and The Logos as the intermediary
between God and humans.

Neoplatonism was an easy fit for Christianity, which saw explanations in it
for their entire spiritual cosmology, and for the first millenia it seemed the
default explanation for the spiritual experience, only really easing its grip on the
Christian mind with Thomas Aquainas' use of Aristotlian thought to explain Christian
concepts. While not as central in Islamic thought, which had its own strong philosophical
tradition, neoplatonic concepts still carried through Islamic thought for centuries,
right through the Baha'i revelation.

This dominance fell away due to late medieval philosophers, particularly
St. Thomas Acquinas.
If neoplatonism is commonly understood as the philosophical child of Plato,
his philosophy is commonly understood as the philosophical child of Aristotle.
it is an explicit outgrowth of Aristotle's own ontology.
He was deeply influenced by Islamic philosophers, in particular Avicenna,
who were lucky enough to have rediscovered the Greek classics before their
European counterparts.

The rediscovery of Aristotle provided a different philosophical framework with 
its own spiritual flavor.
Aristotle's rejection of neoplatonic forms and emphasis on emperical particulars
resulted in a somewhat more "hard-nosed" philosophy
than neoplatonism.
Such a worldview had little need for abstract unseen worlds. Thomas Aquinas worked 
around this limitation by adapting as needed to bring into line with Chritian
teachings. So, for instance, human beings themselves were seen as being characterized
as "hylomorphic"; that is, in compliance with Aristotle's teaching that all things
were composed of _matter_ in a particular _form_. The spiritual part of man, the "soul,"
was part of this essence, along with the visible matter.
Aquinas departed from Aristotle
in that he incorporated spirit into the unseen essense postulated by Aristotle.
He also did not consider all existing entities hylomorphic.
Angels were not hylomorphic as they had no physical presence. Therefore, a spiritual
world, while not extant in Aristotle's teachings, was therefore necessitated by
Aquinas' philosophy to allow for such things as angels to exist. Where it existed,
it was proven either logically or by appeal to religious authority.

Later western philosophers made way for a spiritual through the philosophy
of idealism. Idealism did not pose the existence of universals in an unseen realm;
rather, they inverted the materialist view by posing material as an extension
of an "idea" - essentially making the material world contingent on a visible
world. Though first proposed by Bishop George Berkely in the early 18th century,
it reached its apothesis in German philosopher Hegel's early 19th
century writings, who posed that Spirit was the highest form of Idea coming
into being. Though idealism itself did not pose an separate invisible world 
as such - such a thing would
misstate idealism as a form of dualism - it did influence many nineteenth and twentieth
century theologians and philosophers, particularly the so-called "right Hegelians"
in Germany. Later non-German exponents like F. H. Bradley in Great Britian
and Josaih Royce in the US not only elaborated this philosophy but used it to
better understand their own Christian faith, and both of them frequently wrote
for religious audiences.

Unfortunately, many philosophical strains of thought went dormant in the academy
in the mid-twentieth century. This was primarily due to the efforts of a number
of analytic philosophers, though there were political reasons this also
happened (see <https://muse.jhu.edu/article/213854>, 
<https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/british-idealism-a-history-2/>); analytic philosophy,
as a materialist philosophical competitor to marxism, was embraced
by the industrial class of the West, as its number included not only defenders of the
Western open society, but also defenders of economic libertinism. However, arguments
in philosophy are never settled finally, and there is interest in idealistic thought again,
along with the broader interest in the study of metaphysics after years of its
death due to academic fashion. And in some, a resurgence in ideas of spirituality,
even if philosophers still don't dare to identify themselves as theists.
Which is all to say, even if it is unfashionable to study the "spiritual worlds"
in today's Western philosophy, there is a deep tradition which was not abandoned
for its unworkability, but instead left fallow for those who choose to tend it.

## Baha'i Views on Spirituality

With this background complete, we are now able to examine what spirituality
may mean within the Baha'i Faith. This analysis has two approaches:

1. Analysis of those writings which explicitly discuss spirituality and
other spiritual worlds.

2. Analysis of the use of the term "spiritual" by central figures of
the Faith, primarily Abdu'l-Baha.
 
### Baha'i Cosmology and Spirituality

The Baha'i Faith give no definition of what is meant by "the spiritual" or
similar analysis. There is no "periodic table" of spiritual elements that
could be used to study spirituality in a cartesian fashion.
There is, however, a discussion of the "spiritual worlds" in existence.
This is in Baha'u'llah's untranslated tablet, "The Tablet of All Food."
In this tablet, Baha'u'llah poses four separate spheres of spirituality:

* Hahut - the station of God's essense itself;

* Lahut - the station of God's attributes and the divine essense of his 
manifestations, only available to God's manifestations;

* Jabarut - the station of divine will and spiritual lawas that will
not change, and the written revelation;

* Malakut - the angelic kindom of the souls following the manifestation

From Steven Lambden's provisional translation, these are not describe in
any sort of length; no more than a short paragraph or two discuss each station.
Notably, much like the "Seven Valleys," this enumeration seems to take its
cue from existing Islamic mystical writings.
It is possible Baha'u'llah has chosen to use this as a known point of discussion, and did not
wish to reify the existence of actual distinct worlds; very likely
given that actual disjunction is a property of physical things.

However one takes it, there are two items this writing clarifies:

* The spiritual world known to all mankind is at the same plane, and other
planes are out of reach;

* This spiritual world is a domain of people. There are parallels to the
physical world in the spiritual world, but physical things do not have
spiritual "projections" in the other world.

That is, humans exist in both the physical world and a spiritual world;
indeed, the "essense" of humanity is said to reside in the spiritual world.
As discussed in Jean-Marc Lipain's
analysis of the "Tablet of All Food", physical reality is "metaphoric" to
people; that is, while we reside in the spiritual realm, the physical reality
is a metaphoric world in which we develop ourselves spiritually.
The converse cannot be said for, for example, the chair you're sitting in, which
is strictly physical. Much in the same way, regrettably, your dog Spot is entirely
physical, and will cease to exist upon his death :-(

Are there non-human spiritual entities? 
In the realm of Malakut, it has been posed that the physical world is metaphoric,
but it doesn't actually mean that there is a "spiritual projection" of every piece
of matter. To prove this, let's think of a dog.

A dog is almost certainly self-aware, though certainly not to the extent humans
are; for instance, I suspect dogs think of people as large,
bipedal hairless dogs. Certainly if physical objects have "spiritual projections"
going into Malakut, the dog itself would also share in that. But it is clear
from Baha'i writings that animals do _not_ share the same spritual station as
mankind. Abdu'l-Baha is clear the the vegetable spirit, and even the animal spirit,
are side-effects of _processes in the physical world_. This is why animals are
not said to have a soul, even though they certainly have a spirit.

So spirituality is, in essence, a particularly human concern. Philosophically,
the description of Malakut could fit in a number of philosophical frameworks.
We could be be existing in the hidden spiritual plane of the neoplatonists,
with our physical essence only as a projection. We could be a hylomorphic composition
of detectable matter and sprit. We could even be an complete Idea coming into
complete being. However one looks at it, the essential point of the writings is
that human beings reside on a spiritual plan of sorts that other sentient
beings do not.

My conclusion is that when we talk about spiritual entities, we are talking
exclusively about entities of a _strictly human concern_. Human beings are
spiritual; many attributes that are distinctly human are spiritual. Health
can be affected by prayers because humans exist on a spiritual plan. One conclusion
that follows from this is that physical objects and physical processes, while
existing at a very real level to ourselves, who are spiritual, are not "spiritually
real."

As for the question of the interaction between the physical and spiritual world,
it seems that the two primary interfaces between the physical and spirit world is
1) His Manifestations and 2) people. Christianity, Islam, and other religions posit
spiritual agents such as angels and demons who carry out actions in the physical
world. Such entities seem restricted. Abdu'l-Baha even defines what angels actually
are:

> The meaning of 'angels' is the confirmations of God and His celestial powers. 
> Likewise angels are blessed beings who have severed all ties with this nether 
> world, have been released from the chains of self and the desires of the flesh, 
> and anchored their hearts to the heavenly realms of the Lord. These are of the 
> Kingdom, heavenly; these are of God, spiritual; these are revealers of God's 
> abounding grace; these are dawning-points of His spiritual bestowals.
>           (Abdu'l-Baha, Selections from the Writings of Abdu'l-Baha, p. 81)

So when Baha'u'llah refers to angels in his writings, such as this:

> Verily, We behold you from Our realm of glory, and shall aid whosoever will 
> arise for the triumph of Our Cause with the hosts of the Concourse on 
> high and a company of Our favored angels.
>      (Baha'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 139)

it is very likely he is talking in the terms stated by Abdu'l-Baha - either
a power of God or saintly humans carrying out his work.

Finally, those who believe in spiritual powers frequently invoke spiritual
causes for happenings in the material world, such as miracles. Such thinking
is similar to the "religious materialism" discussed elsewhere. Baha'i writings,
while not outright denying the possiblity of such occurrences, lay no emphasis
on reports of miracles. This is addressed at length in _Some Answered Questions_.
Indeed, when asked about miracles, Abdu'l-Baha gives the following example
of an actual miracle:

> But in the day of the Manifestation the people with insight see that all 
> the conditions of the Manifestation are miracles, for They are superior to 
> all others, and this alone is an absolute miracle. Recollect that Christ, 
> solitary and alone, without a helper or protector, without armies and 
> legions, and under the greatest oppression, uplifted the standard of God 
> before all the people of the world, and withstood them, and finally conquered 
> all, although outwardly He was crucified. Now this is a veritable miracle 
> which can never be denied. There is no need of any other proof of the truth of Christ.
> The outward miracles have no importance for the people of Reality.
>                   (Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 101)

As Baha'is we are told that we should not denigrate others' religious beliefs
or tell them that any ideas they hold are nonsense. Still, this authors
investigation shows little evidence around suppositions of material events
with supernatural explanation. Supernatural mechanics seem to be a property
strictly confined to the Manifestations and our immortal souls, and the miraculous
occurencies carried out are through material displays of spritual attributes.
One may believe in magic, but the Baha'i writings do not seem to confirm it.

### Usage of "Spiritual" in the Baha'i WRitings

In Baha'i writings, "spiritual" is used exclusively as an adjective, and in connection
with particular things. By studying the things it is associated with, we can
understand exactly what sort of things are spiritual, and perhaps by its omission,
what sort of things are, if not un-spiritual, then less likely to be involved in
discussions of spirituality.

A study of spirituality, as defined in the Baha'i Faith, makes very clear that
far from being the purview of personal beliefs and "wooooo" (as materialists
might put it), spiritual things are items of significance to society that 
have a "shared reality" (that is, are not entirely person) and can
and should be studied. To understand that fact though, it is necessary to
understand what spirituality refers to in the Baha'i writings themselves.


These are many "things" that are said to be spiritual. Unfortunately, those "things" are
just as abstract as the term spirituality! To truly understand, we must continue to
drill down - until we find the particular from the abstract.
What do those things refer to, then?

spiritual state - as opposed to a sensible state; e.g. a state that is not felt
through material means. A way of referring to conditions not testable. May refer
to people or organizations of people.

spiritual things - used in a variety of contexts, it may refer to:
   matters of conscience, esp. as contrasted to political affairs
   philosophically, things referred to neoplatonically; e.g. "For physical things 
      are signs and imprints of spiritual things; every lower thing is an image 
      and counterpart of a higher thing." -- Abdu'l-Baha
      (Provisional Translations, Tablet of the Universe)
   "spiritual virtues and divine qualities"; e.g. virtues as commonly identified
   as matters of education; e.g. religious or moral instruction; abstract though -
      "Then the donkey is the greatest scientist and the cow an accomplished naturalist, 
       for they have obtained what they know without schooling and years of laborious 
       study in colleges, trusting implicitly to the evidence of the senses and 
       relying solely upon intuitive virtues."
      (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 261)
   as opposed to materialism, in the perjorative sense

spiritual civilization - civilization is used in multiple ways
   civilization = educated and cultivated (refers to individuals)

   civilization = sociologically civilized (refers to societies)
     as opposed to material civilization; refinement on order of culture and morals
     Covered at length in _Promulgation of Universal Peace_
     As an example of material civilization without spritual civilization:
     "... in material civilization good and evil advance together and maintain 
    the same pace. For example, consider the material progress of man in the last 
    decade. Schools and colleges, hospitals, philanthropic institutions, scientific 
    academies and temples of philosophy have been founded, but hand in hand with 
    these evidences of development, the invention and production of means and 
    weapons for human destruction have correspondingly increased.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 108)
    It seems evident which material signs of civilization are also spiritual
    signs, and which are not.

spiritual education
    This seems indistinguishable from religious knowledge, virtuous conduct and morals. Morals
    in particular seem emphasised, e.g.
    "Spiritual education made the disciples radiant lamps in the darkness of the 
    world and caused the Christians of the first and second centuries to become 
    renowned everywhere for their virtues. Even philosophers bore testimony to 
    this. Among them was Galen... a celebrated philosopher of the Greeks, although 
    not a Christian... "In our time there is a certain people called Christians, 
    who, though neither philosophers nor scholastically trained, are superior to 
    all others as regards their morality. They are perfect in morals. Each one of 
    them is like a great philosopher in morals, ethics and turning toward the Kingdom of God."
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 330)
    "Beseech ye the One true God that He may, through the power of the hand 
    of loving-kindness and spiritual education, purge and purify certain souls 
    from the defilement of evil passions and corrupt desires
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 170)

spiritual darkness
    This is not elaborated anywhere, but is alluded to in examples; e.g:
    "Throughout the Orient in the nineteenth century spiritual darkness prevailed, 
    and the religions were submerged in the ocean of blind imitations and 
    adherence to hereditary forms.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 445)

spiritual power
    These are powers of a greater capacity than those of animals. There are two
    types described - the spiritual powers of the prophets, and the spiritual 
    powers of man.

As regards spiritual powers:

Man has also spiritual powers: imagination, which conceives things; thought, which reflects upon realities; comprehension, which comprehends realities; memory, which retains whatever man imagines, thinks and comprehends. The intermediary between the five outward powers and the inward powers is the sense which they possess in common -- that is to say, the sense which acts between the outer and inner powers, conveys to the inward powers whatever the outer powers discern. It is termed the common faculty, because it communicates between the outward and inward powers and thus is common to the outward and inward powers.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 210)

There is confusion over this because this is the old translation; the new translation labels
these consistently as the "inner powers" (whereas the old translation referred to them as "intellectual
powers"). So In practice, it is not specified if these powers are material, i.e. abbetted primarily
by brain activity, spiritual, or both. Elsewhere in Abdu'l-Baha'is writings, he clarifies that "the
intellect is supernatural" (_Foundations of World Unity, p. 60), but this is an old translation.


And that universal Manifestation will subdue the world by spiritual power, not by war and combat; He will do it with peace and tranquillity, not by the sword and arms; He will establish this Heavenly Kingdom by true love, and not by the power of war.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 58)

You will see, therefore, that at the beginning the Cause of Bahá'u'lláh was almost unknown, but on account of being a divine Movement it grew and developed with irresistible spiritual power until in this day, wherever you travel -- East or West -- and in whatever country you journey, you will meet Bahá'í assemblies and institutions.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 44)

Though man has powers and outer senses in common with the animal, yet an extraordinary power exists in him of which the animal is bereft. The sciences, arts, inventions, trades and discoveries of realities are the results of this spiritual power.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 186)

The animal can neither recognize nor apprehend the spiritual power of man and makes no distinction between man and itself, for the reason that its susceptibilities are limited to the plane of the senses.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 311)

There is also a "spiritual power" in religious behavior:
What every believer, new or old, should realize is that the Cause has the spiritual power to re-create us if we make the effort to let that power influence us, and the greatest help in this respect is prayer.
	(Compilations, Lights of Guidance, p. 115)

The atoms of the prophets are just atoms, like all others, but the association of the great spiritual power with them lives, in the place they are laid to rest, a spiritual atmosphere, if one can use this expression. They are, no doubt, endowed with a tremendous spiritual influence and far-reaching power. But the physical character of Their atoms are not different from other peoples, any more than Their bodies and physical functions are different.
	(Compilations, Lights of Guidance, p. 507)

In some cases, this is abstracted away, but it refers to the same impact, as carried forth by religious cause:
"Exert yourselves; your mission is unspeakably glorious. Should success crown your enterprise, America will assuredly evolve into a center from which waves of spiritual power will emanate, and the throne of the Kingdom of God will, in the plentitude of its majesty and glory, be firmly established."
	(Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Baha'u'llah, p. 77)

The Bahá'í Faith not only provides teachings in accordance with which the behaviour of human beings can be reformed, but also makes available a spiritual power which reinforces the devoted efforts of every believer, whether veteran or neophyte. Arising to serve the Cause has, itself, a transforming effect upon believers, as the beloved Guardian wrote with respect to service upon Spiritual Assemblies

	(The Universal House of Justice, Messages 1963 to 1986, p. 349)

spiritual truth

World order can be founded only on an unshakeable consciousness of the oneness of mankind, a spiritual truth which all the human sciences confirm.

	(The Universal House of Justice, 1985 Oct, The Promise of World Peace, p. 4)

spiritual life

this verse in Corinthians, "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive," means, according to this terminology, that Adam [1] is the father of man -- that is to say, He is the cause of the physical life of mankind; His was the physical fatherhood. He is a living soul, but He is not the giver of spiritual life, whereas Christ is the cause of the spiritual life of man, and with regard to the spirit, His was the spiritual fatherhood. Adam is a living soul; Christ is a quickening spirit.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 118)

In like manner, the Holy Manifestations of God are the centers of the light of reality, of the source of mysteries, and of the bounties of love. They are resplendent in the world of hearts and thoughts, and shower eternal graces upon the world of spirits; They give spiritual life and are shining with the light of realities and meanings.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 162)

When we were in the mineral kingdom, although we were endowed with certain gifts and powers, they were not to be compared with the blessings of the human kingdom. In the matrix of the mother we were the recipients of endowments and blessings of God, yet these were as nothing compared to the powers and graces bestowed upon us after birth into this human world. Likewise, if we are born from the matrix of this physical and phenomenal environment into the freedom and loftiness of the spiritual life and vision, we shall consider this mortal existence and its blessings as worthless by comparison.

In the spiritual world the divine bestowals are infinite, for in that realm there is neither separation nor disintegration, which characterize the world of material existence. Spiritual existence is absolute immortality, completeness and unchangeable being. Therefore, we must thank God that He has created for us both material blessings and spiritual bestowals. He has given us material gifts and spiritual graces, outer sight to view the lights of the sun and inner vision by which we may perceive the glory of God. He has designed the outer ear to enjoy the melodies of sound and the inner hearing wherewith we may hear the voice of our Creator. We must strive with energies of heart, soul and mind to develop and manifest  91  the perfections and virtues latent within the realities of the phenomenal world, for the human reality may be compared to a seed. If we sow the seed, a mighty tree appears from it. The virtues of the seed are revealed in the tree; it puts forth branches, leaves, blossoms, and produces fruits. All these virtues were hidden and potential in the seed. Through the blessing and bounty of cultivation these virtues became apparent. Similarly, the merciful God, our Creator, has deposited within human realities certain latent and potential virtues. Through education and culture these virtues deposited by the loving God will become apparent in the human reality, even as the unfoldment of the tree from within the germinating seed. I will pray for you.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 90)

Above all, the duty of deepening the spiritual life of your newly- enrolled co-workers is paramount, for the fate of the entire community depends upon the individual believers. Without the whole- hearted support of each and every one of the friends, ever measure adopted., no matter how well thought out, is fore-doomed to failure.

spiritual world

In the spiritual world, the divine bestowals are infinite, for in that realm there is neither separation nor disintegration which characterize the world of material existence. Spiritual existence is absolute immortality, completeness and unchangeable being.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Baha'i World Faith - Abdu'l-Baha Section, p. 266)

Know thou that the expressions of the creative hand of God throughout His limitless worlds are themselves limitless. Limitations are a characteristic of the finite, and restriction is a quality of existent things, not of the reality of existence. This being the case, how can one, without proof or testimony, conceive of creation being bound by limits? Gaze with penetrating vision into this new cycle. Hast thou seen any matter in which God is bounded by limits which He cannot overstep? Nay, by the excellence of His glory! On the contrary, His tokens have encompassed all things and are sanctified and exalted beyond computation in the world of creation.

These are spiritual truths relating to the spiritual world. In like manner, from these spiritual realities infer truths about the material world. For physical things are signs and imprints of spiritual things; every lower thing is an image counterpart of a higher thing. Nay, earthly and heavenly, material and spiritual, accidental and essential, particular and universal, structure and foundation, appearance and reality and the essence of all things, both inward and outward -- all of these are connected one with another and are interrelated in such a manner that you will find that drops are patterned after seas, and that atoms are structured after suns in proportion to their capacities and potentialities. For particulars in relation to what is below them are universals, and what are great universals in the sight of those whose eyes are veiled are in fact particulars in relation to the realities and beings which are superior to them. Universal and particular are in reality incidental and relative considerations. The mercy of thy Lord, verily, encompasseth all things!

Know then that the all-embracing framework that governs existence includes within its compass every existent being -- particular or universal  -- whether outwardly or inwardly, secretly or openly. Just as particulars are infinite in number, so also the vast universals and the great realities of the universe are without number and beyond computation.

ABHA KINGDOM  -- - {The Most Glorious Kingdom:} the spiritual world beyond this world.

	(Shoghi Effendi, This Decisive Hour, p. 148)

We must also remember that sex is a characteristic of this world, not of the spiritual world.

	(The Universal House of Justice, 1992 Feb 23, Ancient Goddess Religions)

spiritual bounties

The favors of God are all-surrounding, but should the conscious eye of the soul of man remain veiled and darkened, he will be led to deny these universal signs and remain deprived of these manifestations of divine bounty. Therefore, we must endeavor with heart and soul in order that the veil covering the eye of inner vision may be removed, that we may behold the manifestations of the signs of God, discern His mysterious graces and realize that material blessings as compared with spiritual bounties are as nothing. The spiritual blessings of God are greatest.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 90)

Sixth, the world of humanity is in need of the confirmations of the Holy Spirit. True distinction among mankind is through divine bestowals and receiving the intuitions of the Holy Spirit. If man does not become the recipient of the heavenly bestowals and spiritual bounties, he remains in the plane and kingdom of the animal.  317  For the distinction between the animal and man is that man is endowed with the potentiality of divinity in his nature, whereas the animal is entirely bereft of that gift and attainment.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 317)

spiritual qualities

But on the other hand, when man does not open his mind and heart to the blessing of the spirit, but turns his soul towards the material side, towards the bodily part of his nature, then is he fallen from his high place and he becomes inferior to the inhabitants of the lower animal kingdom. In this case the man is in a sorry plight! For if the spiritual qualities of the soul, open to the breath of the Divine Spirit, are never used, they become atrophied, enfeebled, and at last incapable; whilst the soul's material qualities alone being exercised, they become terribly powerful -- and the unhappy, misguided man, becomes more savage, more unjust, more vile, more cruel, more malevolent than the lower animals themselves.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Paris Talks, p. 97)

In explaining these intellectual realities, one is obliged to express them by sensible figures because in exterior existence there is nothing that is not material. Therefore, to explain the reality of the spirit -- its condition, its station -- one is obliged to give explanations under the forms of sensible things because in the external world all that exists is sensible. For example, grief and happiness are intellectual things; when you wish to express those spiritual qualities you say: "My heart is oppressed; my heart is dilated," though the heart of man is neither oppressed nor dilated. This is an intellectual or spiritual state, to explain which you are obliged to have recourse to sensible figures. Another example: you say, "such an individual made great progress," though he is remaining in the same place; or again, "such a one's position was exalted," although, like everyone else, he walks upon the earth. This exaltation and this progress are spiritual states and intellectual realities, but to explain them you are obliged to have recourse to sensible figures because in the exterior world there is nothing that is not sensible.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 83)

If we ponder a while over the Qur'ánic verses and proofs, and the traditional accounts which have come down to us from those stars of the heaven of Divine Unity, the Holy Imams, we shall be convinced of the fact that if a soul is endowed with the attributes of true faith and characterized with spiritual qualities he will become to all mankind an emblem of the outstretched mercies of God. For the attributes of the people of faith are justice and fair-mindedness; forbearance and compassion and generosity; consideration for others; candor, trustworthiness, and loyalty; love and loving-kindness; devotion and determination and humanity.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 55)

The absence of spiritual qualities, like darkness, has no existence in itself. As the light of spirituality penetrates deep into the hearts, this darkness gradually dissipates and is replaced by virtue.

	(The Universal House of Justice, 1985 Dec 02, Child Abuse, Psychology and Knowledge of Self)


spiritual body

The disciples had taken many meals from the hand of Christ; why was the last supper distinguished from the others? It is evident that the heavenly bread did not signify this material bread, but rather the divine nourishment of the spiritual body of Christ, the divine graces and heavenly perfections of which His disciples partook, and with which they became filled.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 99)


spiritual vision

He is praying for the success of this trip, and cherishes the hope that it may serve to bring into the Cause people of capacity and of true spiritual vision.

	(Shoghi Effendi, Dawn of a New Day, p. 55)


spiritual nature

	(Shoghi Effendi, Dawn of a New Day, p. 55)

Material advancement has been evident in the world, but there is need of spiritual advancement in like proportion. We must strive unceasingly and without rest to accomplish the development of the spiritual nature in man, and endeavor with tireless energy to advance humanity toward the nobility of its true and intended station. For the body of man is accidental; it is of no importance. The time of its disintegration will inevitably come. But the spirit of man is essential and, therefore, eternal. It is a divine bounty. It is the effulgence of the Sun of Reality and, therefore, of greater importance than the physical body.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 59)

spiritual perfections

## Concluding Thoughts

At this point, study of spirituality is thought of as a strictly religious concern.
Material concerns are thought of as the domain entirely of science. True materialists
handle talk of the "spiritual" by dismissing it entirely. Those who wish to keep
the scientific pursuit while acknowledging the spiritual hedge this by thinking
of the spiritual and material as two different "magesteria"; e.g. the study of
material or measurable things is the purview of science only, and anything spiritual
is the purview of the religious.

This results in the following claims about spirituality:

* Spiritual things cannot be _emperically studied_. Spiritual claims are, by
definition, not testable. If it were testable, it would be subject to scientific
investigation and therefore, not spiritual.

* Spiritual things are entirely personal in nature. This generally follows by
the claims of nontestability. A materialist may uphold spirituality, but only
by believing that it is a force that is essentially personal, as it differs
from person to person.

Spirituality, then, becomes a nebulous concept, beyond rigorous study.
The question is - are these claims true?
