Thesis: The term "spirituality" has become a weasel word in society - and vague term
meant to imply upliftment without saying anything meaningful. Part of the difficulty
is the abstract nature of this term. We can study specific uses of the the term
"spiritual" in the Baha'i Faith to make this term more meaningful. The goal is to
make its use more concrete in discussions, prevent its misuse, and prevent its
mismeasure by materialists who wish to recast spiritual things as a matter entirely
of physical mechanics.

spiritual: "of the spirit"; usually, of or relating to an invisible world.

In Baha'i writings, spiritual is used exclusively as an adjective, and in connection
with particular things. By studying the things it is associated with, we can
understand exactly what sort of things are spiritual, and perhaps by its omission,
what sort of things are generally not spiritual.

At this point, study of spirituality is thought of as a strictly religious concern.
Material concerns are thought of as the domain entirely of science. True materialists
handle talk of the "spiritual" by dismissing it entirely. Those who wish to keep
the scientific pursuit while acknowledging the spiritual hedge this by thinking
of the spiritual and material as two different "magesteria"; e.g. the study of
material or measurable things is the purview of science only, and anything spiritual
is the purview of the religious.

This results in the following claims about spirituality:

* Spiritual things cannot be _emperically studied_. Spiritual claims are, by
definition, not testable. If it were testable, it would be subject to scientific
investigation and therefore, not spiritual.

* Spiritual things are entirely personal in nature. This generally follows by
the claims of nontestability. A materialist may uphold spirituality, but only
by believing that it is a force that is essentially personal, as it differs
from person to person.

Spirituality, then, becomes a nebulous concept, beyond rigorous study.

Note that it is not necessary that religion and spirituality necessarily go together.
Some religions are outright skeptical of non-material explanations. Some schools
of Buddhism eschew any discussion of invisible realities. And many "fundamentalist"
Christians see concepts thought of as spiritual - concepts like the resurrection,
the afterlife, the apocalypse - entirely in material terms. And there have
been efforts to actually study spiritual "things"; e.g. the work by the Templeton
studies. Finally, in many cases, the religions themselves chose to interpret entities
intended to be spiritual and non-material as having material realities, in
many cases due to a misguided fundamentalism or fanatical mindset; see, for
example, Vahid Ranjabar's talk on "materialistic spirituality"; 
<https://youtu.be/R98AnJ3hDFg>.

But in general, the formulation spiritual = religion still holds. Indeed, when
someone claims they are "Spiritual but not religious," the accepted interpretation
is that this is a person who has their own individualistic religious beliefs, but
simply has either not formalized a creed or does not accept those of any of
the religions they know about.

So in popular parlance, "spirituality" is thought of as entirely religious in
nature, referring entirely to non-emperical phenomenon, to be upheld entirely
by personal belief and faith only.

The question is - are these claims true?

## Spirituality in the Baha'i Faith

The Baha'i Faith give no definition of what is meant by "the spiritual" or
similar analysis. There is no "periodic table" of spiritual elements that
could be used to study spirituality in a cartesian fashion.

There is, however, a discussion of the "spiritual worlds" in existence.
This is in Baha'u'llah's untranslated tablet, "The Tablet of All Food."
In this tablet, Baha'u'llah poses four separate spheres of spirituality:

* Hahut - the station of God's essense itself;

* Lahut - the station of God's attributes and the divine essense of his 
manifestations, only available to God's manifestations;

* Jabarut - the station of divine will and spiritual lawas that will
not change, and the written revelation;

* Malakut - the angelic kindom of the souls following the manifestation

From Steven Lambden's provisional translation, these are not describe in
any sort of length; no more than a short paragraph or two discuss each station.
Notably, much like the "Seven Valleys," this enumeration seems to take its
cue from existing Islamic writings.
It is possible Baha'u'llah has chosen to use this as a known point of discussion, and did not
wish to reify the existence of actual distinct worlds; very likely
given that actual disjunction is a property of physical things.
However, from a pragmatic point, the import is the same:

* The spiritual world known to all mankind is at the same plane, and other
planes are out of reach;

* This spiritual world is a domain of people. There are parallels to the
physical world in the spiritual world, but physical things do not have
spiritual "projections" in the other world.

That is, humans exist in both the physical world and a spiritual world;
indeed, the "essense" of humanity is said to reside in the spiritual world.
As discussed in Jean-Marc Lipain's
analysis of the "Tablet of All Food", physical reality is "metaphoric" to
people; that is, while we reside in the spiritual realm, the physical reality
is a metaphoric world in which we develop ourselves spiritually.
The converse cannot be said for, for example, the chair you're sitting in, which
is strictly physical. Much in the same way, regrettably, your dog Spot is entirely
physical, and will cease to exist upon his death :-(

Are there non-human spiritual entities? 

In the realm of Malakut, it has been posed that the physical world is metaphoric,
but it doesn't actually mean that there is a "spiritual projection" of every piece
of matter. To prove this, let's think of a dog.

A dog is almost certainly self-aware, though certainly not to the extent humans
are; for instance, I suspect dogs think of people as large,
bipedal hairless dogs. Certainly if physical objects have "spiritual projections"
going into Malakut, the dog itself would also share in that. But it is clear
from Baha'i writings that animals do _not_ share the same spritual station as
mankind. Abdu'l-Baha is clear the the vegetable spirit, and even the animal spirit,
are side-effects of _processes in the physical world_. This is why animals are
not said to have a soul, even though they certainly have a spirit.

My conclusion is that when we talk about spiritual entities, we are talking
exclusively about entities of a _strictly human concern_. Human beings are
spiritual; many attributes that are distinctly human are spiritual. Health
can be affected by prayers because humans exist on a spiritual plan. One conclusion
that follows from this is that physical objects and physical processes, while
existing at a very real level to ourselves, who are spiritual, are not "spiritually
real."

## Spirituality in the Baha'i Writings

A study of spirituality, as defined in the Baha'i Faith, makes very clear that
far from being the purview of personal beliefs and "wooooo" (as materialists
might put it), spiritual things are items of significance to society that 
have a "shared reality" (that is, are not entirely person) and can
and should be studied. To understand that fact though, it is necessary to
understand what spirituality refers to in the Baha'i writings themselves.

spiritual degrees
spiritual state
spiritual things
spiritual civilization
spiritual tone
spiritual education
spiritual darkness
spiritual power
spiritual truth
spiritual life
spiritual war
spiritual bounties
spiritual qualities
spiritual benefit
spiritual body
spiritual vision
spiritual nature
spiritual world
spiritual condition
spiritual progress
spiritual perfections

These are the "things" that are said to be spiritual. Unfortunately, those "things" are
just as abstract as the term spirituality! To truly understand, we must continue to
drill down - until we find the particular from the abstract.
What do those things refer to, then?

spiritual state - as opposed to a sensible state; e.g. a state that is not felt
through material means. A way of referring to conditions not testable. May refer
to people or organizations of people.

spiritual things - used in a variety of contexts, it may refer to:
   matters of conscience, esp. as contrasted to political affairs
   philosophically, things referred to neoplatonically; e.g. "For physical things 
      are signs and imprints of spiritual things; every lower thing is an image 
      and counterpart of a higher thing." -- Abdu'l-Baha
      (Provisional Translations, Tablet of the Universe)
   "spiritual virtues and divine qualities"; e.g. virtues as commonly identified
   as matters of education; e.g. religious or moral instruction; abstract though -
      "Then the donkey is the greatest scientist and the cow an accomplished naturalist, 
       for they have obtained what they know without schooling and years of laborious 
       study in colleges, trusting implicitly to the evidence of the senses and 
       relying solely upon intuitive virtues."
      (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 261)
   as opposed to materialism, in the perjorative sense

spiritual civilization - civilization is used in multiple ways
   civilization = educated and cultivated (refers to individuals)

   civilization = sociologically civilized (refers to societies)
     as opposed to material civilization; refinement on order of culture and morals
     Covered at length in _Promulgation of Universal Peace_
     As an example of material civilization without spritual civilization:
     "... in material civilization good and evil advance together and maintain 
    the same pace. For example, consider the material progress of man in the last 
    decade. Schools and colleges, hospitals, philanthropic institutions, scientific 
    academies and temples of philosophy have been founded, but hand in hand with 
    these evidences of development, the invention and production of means and 
    weapons for human destruction have correspondingly increased.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 108)
    It seems evident which material signs of civilization are also spiritual
    signs, and which are not.

spiritual education
    This seems indistinguishable from religious knowledge, virtuous conduct and morals. Morals
    in particular seem emphasised, e.g.
    "Spiritual education made the disciples radiant lamps in the darkness of the 
    world and caused the Christians of the first and second centuries to become 
    renowned everywhere for their virtues. Even philosophers bore testimony to 
    this. Among them was Galen... a celebrated philosopher of the Greeks, although 
    not a Christian... "In our time there is a certain people called Christians, 
    who, though neither philosophers nor scholastically trained, are superior to 
    all others as regards their morality. They are perfect in morals. Each one of 
    them is like a great philosopher in morals, ethics and turning toward the Kingdom of God."
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 330)
    "Beseech ye the One true God that He may, through the power of the hand 
    of loving-kindness and spiritual education, purge and purify certain souls 
    from the defilement of evil passions and corrupt desires
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 170)

spiritual darkness
    This is not elaborated anywhere, but is alluded to in examples; e.g:
    "Throughout the Orient in the nineteenth century spiritual darkness prevailed, 
    and the religions were submerged in the ocean of blind imitations and 
    adherence to hereditary forms.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 445)

spiritual power
    These are powers of a greater capacity than those of animals. There are two
    types described - the spiritual powers of the prophets, and the spiritual 
    powers of man.

And that universal Manifestation will subdue the world by spiritual power, not by war and combat; He will do it with peace and tranquillity, not by the sword and arms; He will establish this Heavenly Kingdom by true love, and not by the power of war.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 58)

You will see, therefore, that at the beginning the Cause of Bahá'u'lláh was almost unknown, but on account of being a divine Movement it grew and developed with irresistible spiritual power until in this day, wherever you travel -- East or West -- and in whatever country you journey, you will meet Bahá'í assemblies and institutions.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 44)

Though man has powers and outer senses in common with the animal, yet an extraordinary power exists in him of which the animal is bereft. The sciences, arts, inventions, trades and discoveries of realities are the results of this spiritual power.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 186)

The animal can neither recognize nor apprehend the spiritual power of man and makes no distinction between man and itself, for the reason that its susceptibilities are limited to the plane of the senses.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 311)

There is also a "spiritual power" in religious behavior:
What every believer, new or old, should realize is that the Cause has the spiritual power to re-create us if we make the effort to let that power influence us, and the greatest help in this respect is prayer.
	(Compilations, Lights of Guidance, p. 115)

The atoms of the prophets are just atoms, like all others, but the association of the great spiritual power with them lives, in the place they are laid to rest, a spiritual atmosphere, if one can use this expression. They are, no doubt, endowed with a tremendous spiritual influence and far-reaching power. But the physical character of Their atoms are not different from other peoples, any more than Their bodies and physical functions are different.
	(Compilations, Lights of Guidance, p. 507)

In some cases, this is abstracted away, but it refers to the same impact, as carried forth by religious cause:
"Exert yourselves; your mission is unspeakably glorious. Should success crown your enterprise, America will assuredly evolve into a center from which waves of spiritual power will emanate, and the throne of the Kingdom of God will, in the plentitude of its majesty and glory, be firmly established."
	(Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Baha'u'llah, p. 77)

The Bahá'í Faith not only provides teachings in accordance with which the behaviour of human beings can be reformed, but also makes available a spiritual power which reinforces the devoted efforts of every believer, whether veteran or neophyte. Arising to serve the Cause has, itself, a transforming effect upon believers, as the beloved Guardian wrote with respect to service upon Spiritual Assemblies

	(The Universal House of Justice, Messages 1963 to 1986, p. 349)

There are spiritual truths relating to the spiritual world. In like manner, from these spiritual realities infer truths about the material world. For physical things are signs and imprints of spiritual things; every lower thing is an image counterpart of a higher thing. Nay, earthly and heavenly, material and spiritual, accidental and essential, particular and universal, structure and foundation, appearance and reality and the essence of all things, both inward and outward -- all of these are connected one with another and are interrelated in such a manner that you will find that drops are patterned after seas, and that atoms are structured after suns in proportion to their capacities and potentialities. For particulars in relation to what is below them are universals, and what are great universals in the sight of those whose eyes are veiled are in fact particulars in relation to the realities and beings which are superior to them.

	(Provisional Translations, 'Abdu'l-Baha - Tablet of the Universe, p. 2)

Knowledge is not enough; we hope by the Love of God we shall put it into practice. A spiritual universal Force is needed for this. Meetings are good for engendering spiritual force. To know that it is possible to reach a state of perfection, is good; to march forward on the path is better.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Abdu'l-Baha in London, p. 60)


### Spiritual Materialism, Spiritual Analogies and Spiritual Talk

When one first learns about spirit as a child, it is thought of as an almost-physical
process. This is an inescapable port of development. Children think only on concrete,
physical terms until the age of at least ten. To children, when they pray "for" something,
they imagine God manifesting Himself though some "spiritual force" and actuall effecting
a change in a physical world, almost exactly seen as a physical force. Indeed, to a child,
"spirituality" and "gravity" are seen in identical terms - an entity
