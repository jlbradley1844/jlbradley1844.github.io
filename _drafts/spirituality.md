title: The Baha'i View of The Spiritual
---

Spiritual: An empty but uplifting term often found in personals ads.

This, or something like that, was a definition given by a Charles Bufe in
his _American Heritics Dictionary_, a humor paperback that has long since left
my possesion. But the definition has stuck with me, for a real reason.
The term "spirituality" has become a weasel word in society - and vague term
meant to imply upliftment without saying anything meaningful. The dictionary
definition contains many alternate meanings, and a glance through any encyclopedic
reference such as Wikipedia will reveal an unthinkable broad term.

One dictionary definition frames it thusly:

spiritual: "of the spirit"; usually, of or relating to an invisible world.

While technically correct, this rather poorly conveys the concept. We can't
"see" gravitational fields; are they spiritual? Obviously not.

This is problematic when understanding The Baha'i Faith, since the concept
of "the spiritual" is so centrally important under the Baha'i writings. Perhaps
rather than rely upon dictionary definitions, we should allow the Baha'i writings
to define it. If we are to build a spiritual civilization, it would help to
know what it is, rather than just assuming people know what spiritual is - especially
when everyone have different ideas about spirituality due to their upbringing
and life experiences.

## Spirituality - an Introduction

Part of the difficulty in the study of spirituality
is the abstract nature of this term. We can study specific uses of the the term
"spiritual" in the Baha'i Faith to make this term more meaningful. The goal is to
make its use more concrete in discussions, prevent its misuse, and prevent its
mismeasure by materialists who wish to recast spiritual things as a matter entirely
of physical mechanics.

So in popular parlance, "spirituality" is thought of as entirely religious in
nature, referring entirely to non-emperical phenomenon, to be upheld entirely
by personal belief and faith only.
Material concerns are thought of as the domain entirely of science. True materialists
handle talk of the "spiritual" by dismissing it entirely. Those who wish to keep
the scientific pursuit while acknowledging the spiritual hedge this by thinking
of the spiritual and material as two different "magesteria"; e.g. the study of
material or measurable things is the purview of science only, and anything spiritual
is the purview of the religious.

Another word thought to be related to spirituality is supernatural. This is used
in the writings as a synonym for spiritual. The word literally means "not of the
natural world." In such context, it is easy to mistake spiritual for meaning "magic." 

However, there is a distinction between "magic" and "spiritual," and it is important
to understand the distinction. "Magic" indicates a a supernatural power over natural
forces. "Spiritual" does not have that distinction, and it is usually a focus
of one's inner life.
From the point of view of materialist philosophers, the two have an important
distinction as well. "Magic" posits forces that can cause things to happen in
the natural world. It is therefore testable. The existence of "Spirit," on the other
hand, is seen as untestable. Indeed, your more extreme analytic philosophers have
similar skepticism about "The Good," "The Beautiful," virtuous conduct, and a
host of other human concerns we find real but that they find to be undefineable
and untestable, and hence, meaningless.

Note that it is not necessary that religion and spirituality necessarily go together.
Some religions are outright skeptical of non-material explanations. Some schools
of Buddhism eschew any discussion of invisible realities. And many "fundamentalist"
Christians see concepts thought of as spiritual - concepts like the resurrection,
the afterlife, the apocalypse - entirely in material terms. And there have
been efforts to actually study spiritual "things"; e.g. the work by the Templeton
studies. Finally, in many cases, the religions themselves chose to interpret entities
intended to be spiritual and non-material as having material realities, in
many cases due to a misguided fundamentalism or fanatical mindset; see, for
example, Vahid Ranjabar's talk on "materialistic spirituality"; 
<https://youtu.be/R98AnJ3hDFg>.

But in general, the formulation _spiritual = religious_ still holds. Indeed, when
someone claims they are "Spiritual but not religious," the accepted interpretation
by others is that this is a person who does have religious beliefs, but
has either not formalized a creed or does not accept those of any of
the religions they know about.

## Historical Background

The concept of sprituality is generally grounded in a worldview. The Baha'i
worldview is acknowledged to be the view of its prophets The Bab and Baha'u'llah,
but this view did not come _ex nihilo_. Rather, the teachings of The Bab and 
Baha'u'llah elaborated a vew of spirituality that built on and exteded certain 
used within both Islam and Christianity, as well as certain philosophies known
to that world. Additionally, there are some philosophies contemporary with this
revelation.

This section will discuss these views, as they will help frame discussions
of the spiritual found in the Baha'i writings. In the area of religion,
Islam is the most prominent, though the Christian tradition is worth examining.
In the area of philosophy, both neoplatonism and scholasticism discussed
spirituality and influenced thinking in both religions.

### Islam: "Tbe Unseen" and Mysticism

The views of The Bab and Baha'u'llah come from the matrix of the Islamic world,
and for that reason, it is important to consider the nature of spiriuality in
Islam.

The Koran itself is of little help in elaborating "spirituality"; the term itself
does not seem to be found there. The similar term "spirit" is used not for spirituality
but for Jesus, who is referred to as "The Spirit" extensively throughout the Koran.

One view of spirituality is that of an "unseen world" - a world outside of
our own that is immaterial yet somehow interacts with us. And "the unseen" (al-ghayb,
or al-ghiab) is directly referenced in the Koran. The unseen world is described as
something directly known only by God Himself.
This unseen world is populated by beings, just as the seen world is. In the
unseen world, there are three entities: angels, which are immortal and purely
good, devils, which are immortal and strictly evil, and djinn, which are similar
to humans in that they are mortal and may be good or evil.

However, "the unseen" may not exactly map onto our own concept of spirituality.
"The Unseen" is not limited to events taking place in an
invisible world; for instance, The Day of Judgement is said to be to be unseen
because it is knowledge of a future event. Louay Fatoohi in
<https://www.quranicstudies.com/quran/the-concept-of-ghayb-unseen-in-the-quran>
notes that in many cases, "ghayb" is more correctly translated as "matter of
faith. Still, these are considered matters of faith because they are unseen,
and the unseen extends to articles of faith such as belief in the prophets,
belief in divine books, and belief in predestination ("Al-Ghaib", Wikipedia 5/25/2022).
Still, for many believers, religious faith is what counts as spiritual behaviors.

Spirituality in traditional Islam can be interpreted in many ways. This may involve
important articles of faith. For instance, the "resurrection of the dead" has been
interpreted by many as being an essentially spiritual concept, one which if it does
exist, takes place in an immaterial spiritual realm. Others view this as another
element of "the unseen" which describes actual events to take place in the future.
This was the view of Al-Ghazali, who wrote nine hundred years ago and thought of
as the philosophical founder of Sufism. He also thought of every physical reaction
that happened as being occasioned by God himself, making virtually everything that
happens in the physical world an act of Faith (as for physical laws, he claimed the
only reason these hold is God is rational).

Islamic mysticism, which developed during the "golden age" of Islam in the tenth
through twelfth century, more fully developed the sense of "The Spiritual" in Islam.
Many of Baha'u'llah's mystic works presume knowledge of some of these great figures,
including such works as "The Seven Valleys," "The Four Valleys" and "The Tablet of
All Food." This mysticism, as practiced by many Sufi orders, was aimed at developing
spiritual behaviors in an attempt to achieve "union with God."

### The Christianity Spirit and Mysticism

The Gospels, like the Quran, say little regarding a "spirit world." This is particularly
true of the early synoptic Gospels (Mark, Matthew and Luke), which generally cover
the miracles, teachings and parables of Jesus, as well as major events, without ever
glossing into details of spirituality. When "spiritual" things happen, it's generally
miracles and exercisms, which are explained by Jesus Himself as simply signs of God.
Likewise, even includes the Gospel
of John, one of the last books written and the one in which matters of faith are discussed
the most extensively, doesn't use the world spiritual.
However, unlike the
Quran, The Bible contains many books written after the Gospels took place, explaining 
the belief of certain early Christian
fathers, and these speak of spirituality. 
The spirituality discussed is very much similar to the "sense of faith" described
by some Islamic writers regarding the unseen, and in many cases, when the world "spiritual"
is used, one could interchange with the word "religious" or "christian" without losing
sense of the meaning of the sentence. For instance, the message of Jesus is described
as a "spiritual gift" (Romans 1:11); the goal of the teachings is to bring "wisdom and
spiritual understanding" (Collosians 1:10). But there are inklings of the use of "spiritual"
in a more particular manner; for instance in Corinthians, where spirituality is extensively
discussed:

> All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, 
> another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. There are 
> also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, 
> and the glory of the terrestrial is another.
> There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the 
> stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection 
> of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: It is sown in 
> dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: 
> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, 
> and there is a spiritual body. 

> And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was 
> made a quickening spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which 
> is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, 
> earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also 
> that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
>                                        (1 Corinthians 15:39-48)

The Koran has no accompanying commentary for its believers to adopt. Here, we see that the
use of "the spiritual" as illuminating dualist view of human nature, one repeated in the
Baha'i writings. 

As in Islam, Christianity also has an extensive history of mysticism, and the hagiography
of its saints is filled with the names of mystics who sought the paths to their union with God.
Just as Sufi orders detached from the world in their quest, many Christian mystics found
their path in ascetism and withdrawl from the world. In both orders, "spiritualty" is not
only something that is felt, in one's heart during prayer; it is a life one leads. Interestingly,
when perusing works on such saints, the impression one gets is their main activity is
"being spiritual." 
(Ursula King, _Christian Mystics_. 2001 Hidden Spring (Paulist Press), Mahwah NJ.
The lives of the numerous mystics in both the Islamic and Christian traditions attest
to the fact that spirituality can be an experience as much as it is a thing.

### Neoplatonism and The Invisible World

The question one asks in response to both mystical experiences and doctrines that
point "a spiritual world" is exactly what sort of world this is. In the case of both
Christianity and Islam, a philosophy called neoplatonism seemed to explain the
existence of what seemed to be a real spiritual world that was not detectable with
the senses.

Neoplatonism is, of course, an outgrowth of Plato's philosophy. In particular, Plato
felt that all abstract entities existed in a perfect form in some other universe,
and entities in this physical world were projection of this form. To explain our inability
to see these forms, the famous "Cave" analogy was given - like someone who cannot see
actual physical objects in a cave, but only the shadow of those objects, we are forced
to puzzle out what the real nature of objects are without directly seeing them, lest we
make the mistake of confusing the shadows for reality itself. Neoplatonism is philosophy
typically credited to the Egyptian philosopher Poltinus; in practice, "neoplatonism"
was actually a term for the thoughs of a number of Western philophers circa CE 200-500
which elevated the Platonic universe of forms to something like a spiritual world. For
instance, one interpretation attributed to church father Philo 
conceiving of The One as the creator of this universe and The Logos as the intermediary
between God and humans.

Neoplatonism was an easy fit for Christianity, which saw explanations in it
for their entire spiritual cosmology, and for the first millenia it seemed the
default explanation for the spiritual experience, only really easing its grip on the
Christian mind with Thomas Aquainas' use of Aristotlian thought to explain Christian
concepts. While not as central in Islamic thought, which had its own strong philosophical
tradition, neoplatonic concepts still carried through Islamic thought for centuries,
right through the Baha'i revelation.

### Scholasticism and Spirituality

If neoplatonism is commonly understood as the philosophical child of Plato,
scholasticism is commonly understood as the philosophical child of Aristotle.
In truth, the latter view of scholasticism is just as erroneous as the former
view of neoplatonism, but at a very high level it has some truth, in that
it is an explicit outgrowth of Aristotle's own ontology. To give an example of
the centrality of Aristotle, the most well-known and arguably greatest
scholastic philosopher, St. Thomas Aquinas, referred to Aristotle as "The Philosopher." 
Thomism is the scholastic philosophical school associated with his writings;
frequently, "scholasticism" is used as a terminology for both Thomism and teachings
of similar philosophers; e.g. Avicenna in the Islamic world.

The Aristotalian influence in such philosophies resulted in a somewhat more "hard-nosed" philosophy
than neoplatonism, due primarily to Aristotle's naturalistic, empirical inclinations.
Such a worldview had little need for abstract unseen worlds. Thomas Aquinas worked 
around this limitation by adapting as needed to bring into line with Chritian
teachings. So, for instance, human beings themselves were seen as being characterized
as "hylomorphic"; that is, in compliance with Aristotle's teaching that all things
were composed of _matter_ in a particular _form_. Aquinas departed from Aristotle
in that he did not consider all existing entities hylomorphic.
Angels were not hylomorphic as they had no physical presence. Similar logic applied
to our rational soul. A spiritual
world, while not extant in Aristotle's teachings, was therefore necessitated by
Aquinas' philosophy to allow for such things as angels to exist.

Because of the necessity to acknowledge a spiritual world, the philosophies of
neoplatonism and Thomism differed mainly in their emphasis, with the

## Baha'i Views on Spirituality

In Baha'i writings, "spiritual" is used exclusively as an adjective, and in connection
with particular things. By studying the things it is associated with, we can
understand exactly what sort of things are spiritual, and perhaps by its omission,
what sort of things are generally not spiritual.


The Baha'i Faith give no definition of what is meant by "the spiritual" or
similar analysis. There is no "periodic table" of spiritual elements that
could be used to study spirituality in a cartesian fashion.
There is, however, a discussion of the "spiritual worlds" in existence.
This is in Baha'u'llah's untranslated tablet, "The Tablet of All Food."
In this tablet, Baha'u'llah poses four separate spheres of spirituality:

* Hahut - the station of God's essense itself;

* Lahut - the station of God's attributes and the divine essense of his 
manifestations, only available to God's manifestations;

* Jabarut - the station of divine will and spiritual lawas that will
not change, and the written revelation;

* Malakut - the angelic kindom of the souls following the manifestation

From Steven Lambden's provisional translation, these are not describe in
any sort of length; no more than a short paragraph or two discuss each station.
Notably, much like the "Seven Valleys," this enumeration seems to take its
cue from existing Islamic mystical writings.
It is possible Baha'u'llah has chosen to use this as a known point of discussion, and did not
wish to reify the existence of actual distinct worlds; very likely
given that actual disjunction is a property of physical things.

However one takes it, there are two items this writing clarifies:

* The spiritual world known to all mankind is at the same plane, and other
planes are out of reach;

* This spiritual world is a domain of people. There are parallels to the
physical world in the spiritual world, but physical things do not have
spiritual "projections" in the other world.

That is, humans exist in both the physical world and a spiritual world;
indeed, the "essense" of humanity is said to reside in the spiritual world.
As discussed in Jean-Marc Lipain's
analysis of the "Tablet of All Food", physical reality is "metaphoric" to
people; that is, while we reside in the spiritual realm, the physical reality
is a metaphoric world in which we develop ourselves spiritually.
The converse cannot be said for, for example, the chair you're sitting in, which
is strictly physical. Much in the same way, regrettably, your dog Spot is entirely
physical, and will cease to exist upon his death :-(

Are there non-human spiritual entities? 

In the realm of Malakut, it has been posed that the physical world is metaphoric,
but it doesn't actually mean that there is a "spiritual projection" of every piece
of matter. To prove this, let's think of a dog.

A dog is almost certainly self-aware, though certainly not to the extent humans
are; for instance, I suspect dogs think of people as large,
bipedal hairless dogs. Certainly if physical objects have "spiritual projections"
going into Malakut, the dog itself would also share in that. But it is clear
from Baha'i writings that animals do _not_ share the same spritual station as
mankind. Abdu'l-Baha is clear the the vegetable spirit, and even the animal spirit,
are side-effects of _processes in the physical world_. This is why animals are
not said to have a soul, even though they certainly have a spirit.

My conclusion is that when we talk about spiritual entities, we are talking
exclusively about entities of a _strictly human concern_. Human beings are
spiritual; many attributes that are distinctly human are spiritual. Health
can be affected by prayers because humans exist on a spiritual plan. One conclusion
that follows from this is that physical objects and physical processes, while
existing at a very real level to ourselves, who are spiritual, are not "spiritually
real."

The sorts of people who read
Baha'i scholarly works will not at all be surprised to find out that such "magic" as
defined has never been confirmed in the Baha'i writings.

A study of spirituality, as defined in the Baha'i Faith, makes very clear that
far from being the purview of personal beliefs and "wooooo" (as materialists
might put it), spiritual things are items of significance to society that 
have a "shared reality" (that is, are not entirely person) and can
and should be studied. To understand that fact though, it is necessary to
understand what spirituality refers to in the Baha'i writings themselves.

spiritual degrees
spiritual state
spiritual things
spiritual civilization
spiritual tone
spiritual education
spiritual darkness
spiritual power
spiritual truth
spiritual life
spiritual war
spiritual bounties
spiritual qualities
spiritual benefit
spiritual body
spiritual vision
spiritual nature
spiritual world
spiritual condition
spiritual progress
spiritual perfections

These are the "things" that are said to be spiritual. Unfortunately, those "things" are
just as abstract as the term spirituality! To truly understand, we must continue to
drill down - until we find the particular from the abstract.
What do those things refer to, then?

spiritual state - as opposed to a sensible state; e.g. a state that is not felt
through material means. A way of referring to conditions not testable. May refer
to people or organizations of people.

spiritual things - used in a variety of contexts, it may refer to:
   matters of conscience, esp. as contrasted to political affairs
   philosophically, things referred to neoplatonically; e.g. "For physical things 
      are signs and imprints of spiritual things; every lower thing is an image 
      and counterpart of a higher thing." -- Abdu'l-Baha
      (Provisional Translations, Tablet of the Universe)
   "spiritual virtues and divine qualities"; e.g. virtues as commonly identified
   as matters of education; e.g. religious or moral instruction; abstract though -
      "Then the donkey is the greatest scientist and the cow an accomplished naturalist, 
       for they have obtained what they know without schooling and years of laborious 
       study in colleges, trusting implicitly to the evidence of the senses and 
       relying solely upon intuitive virtues."
      (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 261)
   as opposed to materialism, in the perjorative sense

spiritual civilization - civilization is used in multiple ways
   civilization = educated and cultivated (refers to individuals)

   civilization = sociologically civilized (refers to societies)
     as opposed to material civilization; refinement on order of culture and morals
     Covered at length in _Promulgation of Universal Peace_
     As an example of material civilization without spritual civilization:
     "... in material civilization good and evil advance together and maintain 
    the same pace. For example, consider the material progress of man in the last 
    decade. Schools and colleges, hospitals, philanthropic institutions, scientific 
    academies and temples of philosophy have been founded, but hand in hand with 
    these evidences of development, the invention and production of means and 
    weapons for human destruction have correspondingly increased.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 108)
    It seems evident which material signs of civilization are also spiritual
    signs, and which are not.

spiritual education
    This seems indistinguishable from religious knowledge, virtuous conduct and morals. Morals
    in particular seem emphasised, e.g.
    "Spiritual education made the disciples radiant lamps in the darkness of the 
    world and caused the Christians of the first and second centuries to become 
    renowned everywhere for their virtues. Even philosophers bore testimony to 
    this. Among them was Galen... a celebrated philosopher of the Greeks, although 
    not a Christian... "In our time there is a certain people called Christians, 
    who, though neither philosophers nor scholastically trained, are superior to 
    all others as regards their morality. They are perfect in morals. Each one of 
    them is like a great philosopher in morals, ethics and turning toward the Kingdom of God."
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 330)
    "Beseech ye the One true God that He may, through the power of the hand 
    of loving-kindness and spiritual education, purge and purify certain souls 
    from the defilement of evil passions and corrupt desires
	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 170)

spiritual darkness
    This is not elaborated anywhere, but is alluded to in examples; e.g:
    "Throughout the Orient in the nineteenth century spiritual darkness prevailed, 
    and the religions were submerged in the ocean of blind imitations and 
    adherence to hereditary forms.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 445)

spiritual power
    These are powers of a greater capacity than those of animals. There are two
    types described - the spiritual powers of the prophets, and the spiritual 
    powers of man.

As regards spiritual powers:

Man has also spiritual powers: imagination, which conceives things; thought, which reflects upon realities; comprehension, which comprehends realities; memory, which retains whatever man imagines, thinks and comprehends. The intermediary between the five outward powers and the inward powers is the sense which they possess in common -- that is to say, the sense which acts between the outer and inner powers, conveys to the inward powers whatever the outer powers discern. It is termed the common faculty, because it communicates between the outward and inward powers and thus is common to the outward and inward powers.

	(Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 210)

There is confusion over this because this is the old translation; the new translation labels
these consistently as the "inner powers" (whereas the old translation referred to them as "intellectual
powers"). So In practice, it is not specified if these powers are material, i.e. abbetted primarily
by brain activity, spiritual, or both. Elsewhere in Abdu'l-Baha'is writings, he clarifies that "the
intellect is supernatural" (_Foundations of World Unity, p. 60), but this is an old translation.


And that universal Manifestation will subdue the world by spiritual power, not by war and combat; He will do it with peace and tranquillity, not by the sword and arms; He will establish this Heavenly Kingdom by true love, and not by the power of war.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 58)

You will see, therefore, that at the beginning the Cause of Bahá'u'lláh was almost unknown, but on account of being a divine Movement it grew and developed with irresistible spiritual power until in this day, wherever you travel -- East or West -- and in whatever country you journey, you will meet Bahá'í assemblies and institutions.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 44)

Though man has powers and outer senses in common with the animal, yet an extraordinary power exists in him of which the animal is bereft. The sciences, arts, inventions, trades and discoveries of realities are the results of this spiritual power.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 186)

The animal can neither recognize nor apprehend the spiritual power of man and makes no distinction between man and itself, for the reason that its susceptibilities are limited to the plane of the senses.
	(Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 311)

There is also a "spiritual power" in religious behavior:
What every believer, new or old, should realize is that the Cause has the spiritual power to re-create us if we make the effort to let that power influence us, and the greatest help in this respect is prayer.
	(Compilations, Lights of Guidance, p. 115)

The atoms of the prophets are just atoms, like all others, but the association of the great spiritual power with them lives, in the place they are laid to rest, a spiritual atmosphere, if one can use this expression. They are, no doubt, endowed with a tremendous spiritual influence and far-reaching power. But the physical character of Their atoms are not different from other peoples, any more than Their bodies and physical functions are different.
	(Compilations, Lights of Guidance, p. 507)

In some cases, this is abstracted away, but it refers to the same impact, as carried forth by religious cause:
"Exert yourselves; your mission is unspeakably glorious. Should success crown your enterprise, America will assuredly evolve into a center from which waves of spiritual power will emanate, and the throne of the Kingdom of God will, in the plentitude of its majesty and glory, be firmly established."
	(Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Baha'u'llah, p. 77)

The Bahá'í Faith not only provides teachings in accordance with which the behaviour of human beings can be reformed, but also makes available a spiritual power which reinforces the devoted efforts of every believer, whether veteran or neophyte. Arising to serve the Cause has, itself, a transforming effect upon believers, as the beloved Guardian wrote with respect to service upon Spiritual Assemblies

	(The Universal House of Justice, Messages 1963 to 1986, p. 349)

## Concluding Thoughts

At this point, study of spirituality is thought of as a strictly religious concern.
Material concerns are thought of as the domain entirely of science. True materialists
handle talk of the "spiritual" by dismissing it entirely. Those who wish to keep
the scientific pursuit while acknowledging the spiritual hedge this by thinking
of the spiritual and material as two different "magesteria"; e.g. the study of
material or measurable things is the purview of science only, and anything spiritual
is the purview of the religious.

This results in the following claims about spirituality:

* Spiritual things cannot be _emperically studied_. Spiritual claims are, by
definition, not testable. If it were testable, it would be subject to scientific
investigation and therefore, not spiritual.

* Spiritual things are entirely personal in nature. This generally follows by
the claims of nontestability. A materialist may uphold spirituality, but only
by believing that it is a force that is essentially personal, as it differs
from person to person.

Spirituality, then, becomes a nebulous concept, beyond rigorous study.
The question is - are these claims true?
