title: quotes for my own memorization
---

All mankind must be given a knowledge of science and philosophy --
that is, as much as may be deemed necessary. All cannot be scientists
and philosophers, but each should be educated according to his needs
and deserts.

Philosophy of necessity is restricted to a small school
and cannot have an essentially moral influence.

Humanity is divided into two classes: -- one is satisfied with the
knowledge of divinity through its attributes and the other strives to
understand the mysteries of divinity and be informed of the
fundamental principles of divine philosophy.

Philosophy consists in comprehending the reality of
things as they exist, according to the capacity and the power of
man. For the phenomenal reality can comprehend the Preexistent
attributes only to the extent of the human capacity. The mystery of
Divinity is sanctified and purified from the comprehension of the
beings, for all that comes to the imagination is that which man
understands, and the power of the understanding of man does not
embrace the Reality of the Divine Essence.

This universe is not created through the fortuitous concurrences of
atoms; it is created by a great law which decrees that the tree bring
forth certain definite fruit. Verily, this universe contains many
worlds of which we know nothing.

If you should ask a thousand persons, "What
are the proofs of the reality of Divinity?" perhaps not one would be
able to answer. If you should ask further, "What proofs have you
regarding the essence of God?" "How do you explain inspiration and
revelation?" "What are the evidences of conscious intelligence beyond
the material universe?" "Can you suggest a plan and method for the
betterment of human moralities?" "Can you clearly define and
differentiate the world of nature and the world of Divinity?" -- you
would receive very little real knowledge and enlightenment upon these
questions. This is due to the fact that development of the ideal
virtues has been neglected. People speak of Divinity, but the ideas
and beliefs they have of Divinity are, in reality,
superstition. Divinity is the effulgence of the Sun of Reality, the
manifestation of spiritual virtues and ideal powers.

Ordinarily when the word Divinity is mentioned, it is
associated in the minds of the hearers with certain formulas and
doctrines, whereas it essentially means the wisdom and knowledge of
God, the effulgence of the Sun of Truth, the revelation of reality and
divine philosophy.

But according to the
evidence of present world conditions divine philosophy -- which has
for its object the sublimation of human nature, spiritual advancement,
heavenly guidance for the development of the human race, attainment to
the breaths of the Holy Spirit and knowledge  327  of the verities of
God -- has been outdistanced and neglected. Now is the time for us to
make an effort and enable it to advance apace with the philosophy of
material investigation so that awakening of the ideal virtues may
progress equally with the unfoldment of the natural powers. In the
same proportion that the body of man is developing, the spirit of man
must be strengthened; and just as his outer perceptions have been
quickened, his inner intellectual powers must be sensitized so that he
need not rely wholly upon tradition and human precedent.

As regards your own studies: he would advise you not to devote too
much of your time to the abstract side of philosophy, but rather to
approach it from a more historical angle. As to correlating philosophy
with the Bahá'í teachings; this is a tremendous work which scholars in
the future can undertake.

In the same way, there are two sorts of spiritual discoveries. One is
the revelations of the Prophets, and the spiritual discoveries of the
elect. The visions of the Prophets are not dreams; no, they are
spiritual discoveries and have reality... The other kind of spiritual
discoveries is made up of pure imaginations, but these imaginations
become embodied in such a way that many simple-hearted people believe
that they have a reality. That which proves it clearly is that from
this controlling of spirits no result or fruit has ever been
produced. No, they are but narratives and stories.

... from the
beginning which has no beginning, to the end which has no end, a
Perfect Manifestation always exists. This Man of Whom we speak is not
every man; we mean the Perfect Man.

The dependence of the creatures upon God is a dependence of emanation
-- that is to say, creatures emanate from God; they do not manifest
Him.[1] The relation is that of emanation and not that of
manifestation.

The first thing which emanated from God is that
universal reality, which the ancient philosophers termed the "First
Mind," and which the people of Baha call the "First Will." This
emanation, in that which concerns its action in the world of God, is
not limited by time or place; it is without beginning or end --
beginning and end in relation to God are one. The preexistence of God
is the preexistence of essence, and also preexistence of time, and the
phenomenality of contingency is essential and not temporal, as we have
already explained one day at table.

Though the "First Mind" is without beginning, it does not become a
sharer in the preexistence of God, for the existence of the universal
reality in relation to the existence of God is nothingness, and it has
not the power to become an associate of God and like unto Him in
preexistence.

Now concerning the Essence of Divinity: in truth it is on no account
determined by anything apart from its own nature, and can in no wise
be comprehended. For whatsoever can be conceived by man is a reality
that hath limitations and is not unlimited; it is circumscribed, not
all-embracing... Every superior stage
comprehendeth that which is inferior and discovereth the reality
thereof, but the inferior one is unaware of that which is superior and
cannot comprehend it. Thus man cannot grasp the Essence of Divinity,
but can, by his reasoning power, by observation, by his intuitive
faculties and the revealing power of his faith, believe in God,
discover the bounties of His Grace.

The pages of swiftly-appearing newspapers are indeed the mirror
of the world. They reflect the deeds and the pursuits of divers
peoples and kindreds. They both reflect them and make them known. They
are a mirror endowed with hearing, sight and speech. This is an
amazing and potent phenomenon. However, it behoveth the  40  writers
thereof to be purged from the promptings of evil passions and desires
and to be attired with the raiment of justice and equity. They should
enquire into situations as much as possible and ascertain the facts,
then set them down in writing.

---------------

When in company with the
infidels, thou art an infidel and with the pious, thou art pious.

O SON OF DUST! Beware! Walk not with the ungodly and seek not fellowship
with him, for such companionship turneth the radiance of the heart into
infernal fire.

Time and again have We admonished Our beloved ones to avoid, nay to flee
from, anything whatsoever from which the odour of mischief can be
detected. The world is in great turmoil, and the minds of its people are
in a state of utter confusion.

O COMPANION OF MY THRONE! Hear no evil, and see no evil, abase not
thyself, neither sigh and weep. Speak no evil, that thou mayest not hear
it spoken unto thee, and magnify not the faults of others that thine own
faults may not appear great; and wish not the abasement of anyone, that
thine own abasement be not exposed.

It behoveth the people of Bahá to render the Lord victorious through the
power of their utterance and to admonish the people by their goodly deeds
and character, inasmuch as deeds exert greater influence than words.

In the estimation of the
people of Bahá man’s glory lieth in his knowledge, his upright conduct,
his praiseworthy character, his wisdom, and not in his nationality or
rank.

...reflect upon the perfection of man’s creation, and that all
these planes and states are folded up and hidden away within him.
  Dost thou reckon thyself only a puny form
  When within thee the universe is folded?
Then we must labor to destroy the animal condition, till the meaning of
humanity shall come to light.

God hath prescribed unto every one the duty of teaching His Cause. Whoever
ariseth to discharge this duty, must needs, ere he proclaimeth His
Message, adorn himself with the ornament of an upright and praiseworthy
character, so that his words may attract the hearts of such as are
receptive to his call. Without it, he can never hope to influence his
hearers.

Blessed is he who preferreth his brother before himself.

Beware lest the desires of the flesh and of a corrupt inclination provoke
divisions among you. Be ye as the fingers of one hand, the members of one
body.

... beware, O people, lest ye make yourselves
the playthings of the ignorant.

He [the "true seeker"] should be
content with little, and be freed from all inordinate desire.

Valiant acts will
ensure the triumph of this Cause, and a saintly character will reinforce
its power.

O people of God! I admonish you to observe courtesy, for above all else it
is the prince of virtues.

Nature in its essence is the embodiment of My Name, the Maker, the
Creator. Its manifestations are diversified by varying causes, and in this
diversity there are signs for men of discernment. Nature is God’s Will and
is its expression in and through the contingent world.

The essence of detachment is for man to turn his face towards the courts
of the Lord, to enter His Presence, behold His Countenance, and stand as
witness before Him.

Pay thou no heed to the humiliation to which the loved ones of God have in
this Day been subjected. This humiliation is the pride and glory of all
temporal honor and worldly elevation. What greater honor can be imagined?

By My life! Neither the
pomp of the mighty, nor the wealth of the rich, nor even the ascendancy of
the ungodly will endure. All will perish, at a word from Him.

O SON OF BEING! Busy not thyself with this world, for with fire We test
the gold, and with gold We test Our servants.

Rejoice not in the things ye possess; tonight they are yours,
tomorrow others will possess them.

O people! Dispute not concerning My Cause, for ye shall never fathom
the manifold wisdom of your Lord, nor shall ye ever gauge the knowledge of
Him Who is the All-Glorious, the All-Pervading. Whosoever layeth claim to
have known His Essence is without doubt among the most ignorant of all
people. Every atom in the universe would charge such a man with imposture,
and to this beareth witness My tongue which speaketh naught but the truth.

Man is the supreme Talisman. Lack of a proper education hath, however,
deprived him of that which he doth inherently possess.

The first Taráz and the first effulgence which hath dawned from the
horizon of the Mother Book is that man should know his own self and
recognize that which leadeth unto loftiness or lowliness, glory or
abasement, wealth or poverty. Having attained the stage of fulfilment and
reached his maturity, man standeth in need of wealth, and such wealth as
he acquireth through crafts or professions is commendable and praiseworthy
in the estimation of men of wisdom, and especially in the eyes of servants
who dedicate themselves to the education of the world and to the
edification of its peoples.

Great indeed is the claim of
scientists and craftsmen on the peoples of the world.

Tell, O ‘Alí, the loved ones of God that equity is the most fundamental
among human virtues. The evaluation of all things must needs depend upon
it.

The essence of faith is fewness of words and abundance of deeds; he whose
words exceed his deeds, know verily his death is better than his life.

In this Revelation the hosts that can render it victorious are the hosts
of praiseworthy deeds and upright character. The leader and commander of
these hosts hath ever been the fear of God, a fear that encompasseth all
things and reigneth over all things.

The essence of wisdom is the fear of God, the dread of His scourge and
punishment, and the apprehension of His justice and decree.

O people! Consort with the followers of
all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship.

This Wronged One exhorteth the peoples of the world to observe tolerance
and righteousness, which are two lights amidst the darkness of the world
and two educators for the edification of mankind. Happy are they who have
attained thereto and woe betide the heedless.

O YE THAT PRIDE YOURSELVES ON MORTAL RICHES! Know ye in truth that wealth
is a mighty barrier between the seeker and his desire, the lover and his
beloved. The rich, but for a few, shall in no wise attain the court of His
presence nor enter the city of content and resignation.

O YE RICH ONES ON EARTH! The poor in your midst are My trust; guard ye My
trust, and be not intent only on your own ease.

The beginning of magnanimity is when man expendeth his wealth on himself,
on his family and on the poor among his brethren in his Faith.

The essence of charity is for the servant to recount the blessings of his
Lord, and to render thanks unto Him at all times and under all conditions.

O CHILDREN OF DESIRE! Put away the garment of vainglory, and divest
yourselves of the attire of haughtiness.

O EMIGRANTS! The tongue I have designed for the mention of Me, defile it
not with detraction. If the fire of self overcome you, remember your own
faults and not the faults of My creatures, inasmuch as every one of you
knoweth his own self better than he knoweth others.

Humility exalteth man to the heaven of glory and power, whilst
pride abaseth him to the depths of wretchedness and degradation.

They who are the beloved of God, in whatever place they gather and
whomsoever they may meet, must evince, in their attitude towards God, and
in the manner of their celebration of His praise and glory, such humility
and submissiveness that every atom of the dust beneath their feet may
attest the depth of their devotion. The conversation carried by these holy
souls should be informed with such power that these same atoms of dust
will be thrilled by its influence.

That seeker should, also, regard backbiting as grievous error, and keep
himself aloof from its dominion, inasmuch as backbiting quencheth the
light of the heart, and extinguisheth the life of the soul.

Say: Would it profit you in the least if, as ye fondly imagine, your
names were to endure? Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! Was the idol
‘Uzzá(10) made any greater by this, that its name lived on amidst the
worshippers of names?

Great is the station of man. Great must also be his endeavours for the
rehabilitation of the world and the well-being of nations.

O OPPRESSORS ON EARTH! Withdraw your hands from tyranny, for I have
pledged Myself not to forgive any man’s injustice.

The light of men is
Justice. Quench it not with the contrary winds of oppression and tyranny.
The purpose of justice is the appearance of unity among men.

Justice, which consisteth in rendering each his due, dependeth upon
and is conditioned by two words: reward and punishment. From the
standpoint of justice, every soul should receive the reward of his
actions, inasmuch as the peace and prosperity of the world depend
thereon, even as He saith, exalted be His glory: “The structure of
world stability and order hath been reared upon, and will continue to
be sustained by, the twin pillars of reward and punishment”. In brief,
every circumstance requireth a different utterance and every occasion
calleth for a different course of action.

Knowledge is one of the wondrous gifts of God. It is incumbent upon
everyone to acquire it.

Beware, O My loved ones, lest ye despise the merits of My learned servants
whom God hath graciously chosen to be the exponents of His Name ‘the
Fashioner’ amidst mankind. Exert your utmost endeavour that ye may develop
such crafts and undertakings that everyone, whether young or old, may
benefit therefrom. We are quit of those ignorant ones who fondly imagine
that Wisdom is to give vent to one’s idle imaginings and to repudiate God,
the Lord of all men; even as We hear some of the heedless voicing such
assertions today.

People for the most part delight in
superstitions. They regard a single drop of the sea of delusion as
preferable to an ocean of certitude. By holding fast unto names they
deprive themselves of the inner reality and by clinging to vain imaginings
they are kept back from the Dayspring of heavenly signs. God grant you may
be graciously aided under all conditions to shatter the idols of
superstition and to tear away the veils of the imaginations of men.

Some heedless souls roam the lands in the name of God, actively
engaged in ruining His Cause, and call it promoting and teaching the
Word of God; and this notwithstanding that the qualifications of the
teachers of the Faith, like unto stars, shine resplendent throughout
the heavens of the divine Tablets.

The steed of this Valley [of love] is pain; and if there be no pain this journey
will never end.

To merit the madness of love, man must abound
in sanity; to merit the bonds of the Friend, he must be full of spirit.

Whatsoever passeth beyond the limits of moderation will cease
to exert a beneficial influence. Consider for instance such things as
liberty, civilization and the like. However much men of understanding may
favourably regard them, they will, if carried to excess, exercise a
pernicious influence upon men.

It is incumbent upon everyone to observe God’s holy commandments, inasmuch
as they are the wellspring of life unto the world. The heaven of divine
wisdom is illumined with the two luminaries of consultation and compassion
and the canopy of world order is upraised upon the two pillars of reward
and punishment.

It is incumbent upon everyone to aid those daysprings of authority and
sources of command who are adorned with the ornament of equity and
justice. Blessed are the rulers and the learned among the people of Bahá.

O BEFRIENDED STRANGER! The candle of thine heart is lighted by the hand of
My power, quench it not with the contrary winds of self and passion.

O SON OF MAN! For everything there is a sign. The sign of love is
fortitude under My decree and patience under My trials.

... without patience the wayfarer on
this journey will reach nowhere and attain no goal. Nor should he ever be
downhearted; if he strive for a hundred thousand years and yet fail to
behold the beauty of the Friend, he should not falter.

Strife and conflict befit the beasts of the wild. It was through the grace
of God and with the aid of seemly words and praiseworthy deeds that the
unsheathed swords of the Bábí community were returned to their scabbards.
Indeed through the power of good words, the righteous have always
succeeded in winning command over the meads of the hearts of men.

This Wronged One hath forbidden  he people of God to engage in contention
or conflict and hath exhorted them to righteous deeds and praiseworthy
character. In this day the hosts that can ensure the victory of the Cause
are those of goodly conduct and saintly character.

Nothing whatever
can, in this Day, inflict a greater harm upon this Cause than dissension
and strife, contention, estrangement and apathy, among the loved ones of
God. Flee them, through the power of God and His sovereign aid, and strive
ye to knit together the hearts of men...

Every age hath its own problem, and every soul its particular
aspiration. The remedy the world needeth in its present-day
afflictions can never be the same as that which a subsequent age may
require. Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in,
and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.”

Be thou guided by wisdom under all conditions, inasmuch as persons who
harbour evil motives have been and are still diligently engaged in
intriguing.

Admonish everyone
moreover to observe prudence as ordained by Him, and in the Name of God
advise them, saying: It behoveth every one in this Day of God to dedicate
himself to the teaching of the Cause with utmost prudence and
steadfastness. Should he discover a pure soil, let him sow the seed of the
Word of God, otherwise it would be preferable to observe silence.

Beware that thou allow not the wolf to become the
shepherd of God’s flock, and surrender not the fate of His loved ones to
the mercy of the malicious. Expect not that they who violate the
ordinances of God will be trustworthy or sincere in the faith they
profess.

Schools must first train
the children in the principles of religion, so that the Promise and the
Threat recorded in the Books of God may prevent them from the things
forbidden and adorn them with the mantle of the commandments; but this in
such a measure that it may not injure the children by resulting in
ignorant fanaticism and bigotry.

The purpose of religion as revealed from the heaven of God’s holy Will is
to establish unity and concord amongst the peoples of the world; make it
not the cause of dissension and strife. The religion of God and His divine
law are the most potent instruments and the surest of all means for the
dawning of the light of unity amongst men. The progress of the world, the
development of nations, the tranquillity of peoples, and the peace of all
who dwell on earth are among the principles and ordinances of God.

O SON OF MAN! Ponder and reflect. Is it thy wish to die upon thy bed, or
to shed thy life-blood on the dust, a martyr in My path, and so become the
manifestation of My command and the revealer of My light in the highest
paradise? Judge thou aright, O servant!

O SON OF BEING! Bring thyself to account each day ere thou art summoned to
a reckoning; for death, unheralded, shall come upon thee and thou shalt be
called to give account for thy deeds.

O MY CHILDREN! I fear lest, bereft of the melody of the dove of heaven, ye
will sink back to the shades of utter loss, and, never having gazed upon
the beauty of the rose, return to water and clay.

Consider how abject is the state of the disbelievers. They
all give utterance to the words: ‘Verily He is to be praised in His deeds
and is to be obeyed in His behest.’ Nevertheless if We reveal aught which,
even to the extent of a needle’s eye, runneth counter to their selfish
ways and desires, they will disdainfully reject it.

Say: To assist Me is to teach My Cause. This is a theme with which whole
Tablets are laden.

Take heed lest the deeds wrought by the embodiments of idle fancy sadden
you or the acts committed by every wayward oppressor grieve you.

O SON OF DUST! The wise are they that speak not unless they obtain a
hearing, even as the cup-bearer, who proffereth not his cup till he
findeth a seeker, and the lover who crieth not out from the depths of his
heart until he gazeth upon the beauty of his beloved. Wherefore sow the
seeds of wisdom and knowledge in the pure soil of the heart, and keep them
hidden, till the hyacinths of divine wisdom spring from the heart and not
from mire and clay.

Defile not your tongues with the
cursing and reviling of any soul, and guard your eyes against that which
is not seemly. Set forth that which ye possess. If it be favourably
received, your end is attained; if not, to protest is vain.

Leave ye unto themselves the immature ones
of the world—they that are moved by selfish desire and cling to the
exponents of idle fancy.

Every word is endowed with a spirit, therefore the speaker or expounder
should carefully deliver his words at the appropriate time and place, for
the impression which each word maketh is clearly evident and perceptible.

It behoveth a prudent man of wisdom to
speak with utmost leniency and forbearance so that the sweetness of his
words may induce everyone to attain that which befitteth man’s station.

Warn, O Salmán, the beloved of the one true God, not to view with too
critical an eye the sayings and writings of men. Let them rather approach
such sayings and writings in a spirit of open-mindedness and loving
sympathy.

In these days truthfulness and sincerity are sorely afflicted in the
clutches of falsehood, and justice is tormented by the scourge of
injustice. The smoke of corruption hath enveloped the whole world in such
wise that naught can be seen in any direction save regiments of soldiers
and nothing is heard from any land but the clashing of swords. We beseech
God, the True One, to strengthen the wielders of His power in that which
will rehabilitate the world and bring tranquillity to the nations.

Fair speech and truthfulness, by reason of their
lofty rank and position, are regarded as a sun shining above the horizon
of knowledge.

Trustworthiness is the greatest portal
leading unto the tranquillity and security of the people. In truth the
stability of every affair hath depended and doth depend upon it.

O CHILDREN OF MEN! Know ye not why We created you all from the same dust?
That no one should exalt himself over the other. Ponder at all times in
your hearts how ye were created. Since We have created you all from one
same substance it is incumbent on you to be even as one soul, to walk with
the same feet, eat with the same mouth and dwell in the same land, that
from your inmost being, by your deeds and actions, the signs of oneness
and the essence of detachment may be made manifest.

The Great
Being saith: O well-beloved ones! The tabernacle of unity hath been
raised; regard ye not one another as strangers. Ye are the fruits of one
tree, and the leaves of one branch.

Such exhortations to union and concord as are inscribed in the Books of
the Prophets by the Pen of the Most High bear reference unto specific
matters; not a union that would lead to disunity or a concord which would
create discord. This is the station where measures are set unto
everything, a station where every deserving soul shall be given his due.
Well is it with them that appreciate the meaning and grasp the intent of
these words, and woe betide the heedless. Unto this all the evidences of
nature, in their very essences, bear ample testimony. Every discerning man
of wisdom is well acquainted with that which We have mentioned, but not
those who have strayed far from the living fountain of fairmindedness and
are roving distraught in the wilderness of ignorance and blind fanaticism.

We fain would hope
that the people of Bahá may be guided by the blessed words: ‘Say: all
things are of God.’ This exalted utterance is like unto water for
quenching the fire of hate and enmity which smouldereth within the hearts
and breasts of men. By this single utterance contending peoples and
kindreds will attain the light of true unity.

O CHILDREN OF THE DIVINE AND INVISIBLE ESSENCE! Ye shall be hindered from
loving Me and souls shall be perturbed as they make mention of Me. For
minds cannot grasp Me nor hearts contain Me.

O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Guidance hath ever been given by words, and now it
is given by deeds. Every one must show forth deeds that are pure and holy,
for words are the property of all alike, whereas such deeds as these
belong only to Our loved ones. Strive then with heart and soul to
distinguish yourselves by your deeds. In this wise We counsel you in this
holy and resplendent tablet.

In this Day whatsoever serveth to reduce blindness
and to increase vision is worthy of consideration. This vision acteth as
the agent and guide for true knowledge. Indeed in the estimation of men of
wisdom keenness of understanding is due to keenness of vision. The people
of Bahá must under all circumstances observe that which is meet and seemly
and exhort the people accordingly.

In brief, dissensions among various sects have opened the way to weakness.
Each sect hath picked out a way for itself and is clinging to a certain
cord. Despite manifest blindness and ignorance they pride themselves on
their insight and knowledge. Among them are mystics who bear allegiance to
the Faith of Islám, some of whom indulge in that which leadeth to idleness
and seclusion.

This Wronged One hath invariably treated the wise with affection. By the
wise is meant men whose knowledge is not confined to mere words and whose
lives have been fruitful and have produced enduring results. It is
incumbent upon everyone to honour these blessed souls.

FIX your gaze upon wisdom in all things, for it is an unfailing antidote.
How often hath it turned a disbeliever into a believer or a foe into a
friend? Its observance is highly essential, inasmuch as this theme hath
been set forth in numerous Tablets revealed from the empyrean of the Will
of Him Who is the Manifestation of the light of divine unity.

Religion is verily the chief instrument
for the establishment of order in the world and of tranquillity amongst
its peoples. The weakening of the pillars of religion hath strengthened
the foolish and emboldened them and made them more arrogant. Verily I say:
The greater the decline of religion, the more grievous the waywardness of
the ungodly. This cannot but lead in the end to chaos and
confusion.

Let your vision be world-embracing, rather
than confined to your own self. The Evil One is he that hindereth the rise
and obstructeth the spiritual progress of the children of men.

The summons and the message which We gave were never
intended to reach or to benefit one land or one people only. Mankind in
its entirety must firmly adhere to whatsoever hath been revealed and
vouchsafed unto it. Then and only then will it attain unto true liberty.

In formulating the principles and laws a part hath been devoted to
penalties which form an effective instrument for the security and
protection of men. However, dread of the penalties maketh people desist
only outwardly from committing vile and contemptible deeds, while that
which guardeth and restraineth man both outwardly and inwardly hath been
and still is the fear of God.

... We have ordained that complete victory should be achieved through speech
and utterance, that Our servants throughout the earth may thereby become
the recipients of divine good.

The world is continually proclaiming these words: Beware, I am evanescent,
and so are all my outward appearances and colours. Take ye heed of the
changes and chances contrived within me and be ye roused from your
slumber.

O Salmán! The door of the knowledge of the Ancient Being hath ever been,
and will continue for ever to be, closed in the face of men. No man’s
understanding shall ever gain access unto His holy court. As a token of
His mercy, however, and as a proof of His loving-kindness, He hath
manifested unto men the Day Stars of His divine guidance, the Symbols of
His divine unity, and hath ordained the knowledge of these sanctified
Beings to be identical with the knowledge of His own Self.

Having created the world and all that liveth and moveth therein, He,
through the direct operation of His unconstrained and sovereign Will,
chose to confer upon man the unique distinction and capacity to know Him
and to love Him—a capacity that must needs be regarded as the generating
impulse and the primary purpose underlying the whole of creation...

And now concerning thy question regarding the nature of religion. Know
thou that they who are truly wise have likened the world unto the human
temple. As the body of man needeth a garment to clothe it, so the body of
mankind must needs be adorned with the mantle of justice and wisdom.

O friends! Be not careless of the virtues with which ye have been endowed,
neither be neglectful of your high destiny. Suffer not your labors to be
wasted through the vain imaginations which certain hearts have devised.

Center your energies in
the propagation of the Faith of God. Whoso is worthy of so high a calling,
let him arise and promote it.

That copper can be turned into gold is in
itself sufficient proof that gold can, in like manner, be transmuted into
copper, if they be of them that can apprehend this truth.

Is it within
human power, O Hakím, to effect in the constituent elements of any of the
minute and indivisible particles of matter so complete a transformation as
to transmute it into purest gold? Perplexing and difficult as this may
appear, the still greater task of converting satanic strength into
heavenly power is one that We have been empowered to accomplish. The Force
capable of such a transformation transcendeth the potency of the Elixir
itself. The Word of God, alone, can claim the distinction of being endowed
with the capacity required for so great and far-reaching a change.

The All-Merciful hath conferred upon man the faculty of vision, and
endowed him with the power of hearing. Some have described him as the
“lesser world,” when, in reality, he should be regarded as the “greater
world.” The potentialities inherent in the station of man, the full
measure of his destiny on earth, the innate excellence of his reality,
must all be manifested in this promised Day of God.

My creatures are even as the fish of
the deep. Their life dependeth upon the water, and yet they remain unaware
of that which, by the grace of an omniscient and omnipotent Lord,
sustaineth their very existence.
