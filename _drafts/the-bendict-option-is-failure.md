## The Benedict Option Is a Failure

This is one of my periodic writings where the impetus is seeing something that really bothered me,
just generally as a person. Particularly as a religious person who hopes his belief actually makes
a differnce in his actions.

One of the odder movements of "the right" is what one might term the
Catholic Dominion movement. Or their related cousins, those of the "orthodox Christian" variety
(orthodox in the sense of being very structured, not in the Eastern Orthodox sense). The first
time I heard about this was in an old _New Yorker_ article from 2017 that I'd been intending
to write about, regarding the writings of Ron Dreher, an _American Conservative_ author.
He is a Christian, but I've heard similar writings from others in the Catholic "Right", the 
sorts of writers who long to restore to the Catholic Church their old function as arbiters of
culture and popular morality.

Such right-leaning Christian intellectuals find the state of American culture deeply problematic.
The underlying problem, as they see it, is society as a whole is simply just too _irreligious_.
This concern goes on beyond the regular whining about common civic vices, litter in the streets, foul language
in public and all the little things. No, many religious people regard themselves as deeply estranged from
society; that present society is truly immoral and irredemable; that they feel their presence in such a society 
is some sort of imposition on their being; and that only among other people of
True Virtue can they and their fellow virtuous people truly be free. Were one to find a Moses among them to argue
with God over the fate of Sodom, he would doubtless proclaim "Even if there are a thousand good people, Sodom cannot
be saved and you should destroy it now!" If they cannot destroy it, they must separate the
Christian community from it firmly. Barring this, the
Christian community will slowly be poisoned by their surroundings and cease to offer a
virtuous example for the rest of the world.

For them, the question is what to do about it. This is a novel situation for the religious right.
In the not-too-distant past of the United States, it seemed possible to dream of a working
"Christian Majority" that would deliver desired cultural power to Christians through the ballot box. These days are
long gone, and the most thoughtful of them have admitted such high points as the eighties "Moral Majority"
delivered illusory victories that badly overrepresented the actual reach of Christian culture in the
United States. When victory at the ballot box seems elusive, 
the oridinary far right response is armed violence,
but fortunately these are principled Christians who, whether you agree with them or not, take their religion
serious. Ilncluding the whole "put away your swords" thing. They may be deeply illiberal and
antimajoritarian, but they have no intention of imposing their beliefs at gunpoint. Indeed, many
view the far right tendencies of their fellow Christians not with joy, but as positive proof that the greater culture
is badly contaminating the Christian community.

The harmless-sounding solution proposed by some of these is "The Benedict Option." This was
most prominently proposed by Dreher's book of the same name introducing the concept, but it has continued
to spread through conservative circles.
It is NOT what it sounds like to naive American ears; this has nothing to with Benedict Arnold
and the subterfuge one associates with it.(1) It should probably
more properly be called the *Benedictine* option, after the religious order for which it is named.
The Benedict Option proposes a separatist solution of sorts, inspired by the Benedictine
monostaries of the Dark Ages. As society is hopelessly,
utterly corrupted and compromised, the only solution is to build a parallel society. The truly virtuous
must withdraw their support from the corrupted society and instead build a parallel society for the other
virtuous people. This is said to be like the Benedictine monks of the European Dark Ages, who built
monastaries that allowed civilization to exist within, while outside the walled monastary fortresses, darkness
ruled.

I certainly sympathize with this impulse, and at least the impulse is constructive. Rather than threaten
to repeat the religious wars of the sixteenth century, at least these Christians
have limited their Falangist fantasies to themselves and have no
desire to impose it on anyone else. And one must appreciate the fact that such intellectuals recognize
that the increasing partisanship of evangelical Christian movements is not to be celebrated, but
is instead a sign of the corruption of the Christian body.
And I certainly get why virtuous people may think there is something advantageous to this situation.
I don't find a separatist solution desireble, but one reason I do not feel threatened by the vice of the world is due to
good fortune. My relatives are all very decent people; those who are
not religious are still very good people. I selected a profession that is skill-based rather
than relationship based, making impartiality more important than influence or connections. 
My workplace is a collegial place full of intelligent 
co-workers, and in my line of work (engineering), outright immoral behavior is rare, partly because there
is rarely professional advantage in that. In short, I'm sheltered by a lucky set of choices I made much
earlier in life, and were I not in a position to be as picky where I work and live, I might feel not
feel as happy about the moral environment I inhabit.

And if you had only a surface knowledge of the Baha'i Faith, you might _think_ it is in fact endorsing
the Benedictine Option. My feeling is the Benedict Option, even if it were realistic, 
is not nearly as religious and morally
advantageous as their proponents claim. Those who mistake the Baha'i Faith as somehow proposing either
a "parallel society" or a superstate of the near term - even those who are Baha'is - may be making similar mistakes.

Before I begin: I do wish to clarify something that is important to understand in Shoghi Effendi's writings,
since his writings form the backbone of many of the ideas of the Administrative order. It is important
to separate _normative_ writings - writings detailing what the Baha'is must do - from _prophetic_ 
and _inspirational_ writings - writings that paint a long term vision of what the outcome of these
efforts will and must be. Here's an example of the prophetic variety:



Whether you find this inspiriational or not depends on whether you are a declared Baha'i. But
you can't argue that it isn't prophetic. You may not agree with it, but he is painting a vision
of a future that he thinks can and will happen.

What does he want the Baha'is to do about this? The actions are quite different:



With that being clarified, here are some of the misconceptualizations that drive The Benedict Option.

### Mistake #1: Virtue as a Collective Reward

One of the chief conceits of The Benedict Option is the assertion that virtue is essentially
"wasted" in American society. American society is so far gone that any virtuous conduct is simply
"pearls before swine." The culture is so rotten that one must create a parallel culture,
and live within that, the better to cultivate the spirit. Within the bounds of this culture,
one may then develop virtues, without the contaminating effects of society.

Underlying this is a misunderstanding of what virtue is and who it benefits. Going back to
everone's favorite pagan philosopher, Aristotle, the answer is clear: you cultivate virtue
_because it benefits you_.



Aristotle developed this concept without the need of such concepts as original sin and purity
of the soul; far from conceiving it as a means of grace, he noted that the main benefit is
the practitioner, as he will benefit due to his own flourishing.

I see this misunderstanding when people talk about the laws in the _Kitab-i-Aqdas_, awaiting
some day far in the future where the benefits will be apparent to all. Missing from this is
the fact that the main benefit is being received in the _here and now_ by anyone who abides
by these laws. After all, nobody is holding a gun to your head, yet you do it. Why? Probably
because you knew that if you threw out the rulebook, you'd be back to practicing it a year
from now, older but wiser. 



### Mistake #2: Religion as a Community Benefit


### Mistake #3: A Warped Sense of Success


### Mistake #4: A Culture of Closed Ideas


### Mistake #5 Spiritual Materialism


(1) Actually, it is known where the name comes from. The Benedict Option seems to have been inspired by a passage from
Alisdair MacIntyre, a philosopher noted both for his defense of
virtue ethics and for his defense of Catholicism in the notably materialistic millieu of English-speaking
philosophy. While some conservatives are fans of MacIntyte because of both of these
things, he himself describes himself as neither a conservative or liberal, and has
criticized the idea strongly himself.
