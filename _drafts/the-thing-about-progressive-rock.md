#The Right Kind of Uncool (or, About Progressive Rock)

Progressive rock is in the news again.

Well sort of. In as much as you see the occasional headline on rock
anymore, which is infrequent, and on the near-comotose genre of
progressive rock, which is even moreso.

The source of the hubub is David Weigel's new book ["The Show That
Never Ends: The Rise and Fall of Prog
Rock"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393242250/). This is the sort of
book that used to show up, unnanounced and unloved, in the Barnes and
Noble's music section, or perhaps in the waiting room of your son's
guitar teacher; the sort of glossy labor of love that you suspect has
earned the author nothing but heartache, headache and a debt-laden
credit card.  However, this particular book has garnered much more
press than is usual for these sorts of works. David Weigel is a
well-known political writer, and excerpts from his book have appeared
years ago in a [multipart series of articles in
Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/prog_spring/features/2012/prog_rock/history_of_prog_the_nice_emerson_lake_palmer_and_other_bands_of_the_1970s_.html)
and recently in [the Daily
Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/take-a-cruise-with-musics-uncoolest-people). Similar
headlines were made when [Yes' 2017 induction into in the Rock & Roll
Hall of Fame](https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/yes), something that
fans of years before had thought unlikely and critics thought
ludicrous.

However, what inspired me to write this was something of a far more
gassy nature: a rock book describing an indie-rock band in terms so
pretensious and pompous as to make any prog rock fan blush. Apparently
someone thought [the Strokes (remember them?) were the center of the
music universe in
2001-2002](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2017/06/lizzy_goodman_s_meet_me_in_the_bathroom_reviewed.html). Yet
I'm sure the writer would have hated progressive rock. You see, rock
critics *hate* progressive rock. The reasons I'd never given any
serious thought, but this, um, _specimen_ of a book has helped me to
see why exactly rock critics turned on progressive rock.

Presently in 2017, questions about about progressive rock always
center around why _people_ continue to listen to this music. The
almost entirely male fan base seems to be a handul of easily-mocked
baby boomer obsessives, interested in only hearing repeats of LPs from
forty years ago. Looking at the present, one wonders what was so great
about them in the past. What was it that caused a movement so fierce
that the backlash continues to this day? What is it about these acts
that is so horrible?  And if these acts, which are generally regarded
as extemely musical competent, are horrible, why are other genres like
teen pop, europop, death metal and other musics distinctly repellent
to ousiders generally exempt from this sort of ridicule?

Because I'm a disorganized sort of person and because people like
numbered lists for some reason, here's a numbered list of things
people get wrong or misremember:

1. There wasn't a 'prog rock' at the time. Some might have called it
'art rock,' a term that was also applied to a lot of other ambitious
but musically unrelated acts. Also, some acts such as Pink Floyd
weren't even considered 'prog' at the type, but were instead lumped in
with other long-forgotten genres; in the case of Pink Floyd, this was
the long-forgotten 'space rock' genre, a meaningless term unless
you're also one of the 10 remaining living beings that remember
Hawkwind.  remember space rock. Rush wasn't prog; they were simply
viewed as a hard rock band that aspired to pointy-headed
pretensions. Additionally, well-regarded seventies acts like David
Bowie, Eno and Frank Zappa have never been labeled as "Prog" in spite
of catering to nearly-identical fan bases.

2. Reading about the reaction to prog, you would think that these were
THE big acts of the seventies chart-toppers, whose sales competed with
the likes of Led Zeppelin and the Rolling stones. Some were big,
particulary their live shows. But aside from Yes and ELP, their album
sales certainly put them into "cult act" status - perhaps better than
a run-of-the mill hard rock band, but nothing like the big acts like
Led Zeppelin and Rolling Stones. Additionally, radio play, which was
always limited, became even moreso as FM stations professionalized and
stopped letting their DJs play 10-minute epics.

3. Rock critics were generally quite favorable towards the more
accomplished acts, particularly during the early seventies, when the
strongest albums came out. Albums like King Crimson's
"In the Court of the Crimson King" and "Red," Yes' "Close to the
Edge," and Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of The Moon" had no trouble
breaking into critic's top 10 charts at the time.

Given the facts as I report them above, why the severe backlash? Why
this particular musical movement, and not several other equally
successful subgenres of the seventies?

True, the movement didn't exactly wear its popularity well. The
movement was particularly beloved by affluent teens and the fan base
was overwhelmingly male. Some of the bands, ELP in particular, had
rather obnoxious opinions about about rock music in general. A loud
subset of their fans were particularly cultish and snotty. Finally,
the rise of punk coincided with a wholesale across-the-board
decline in the quality of the releases by bands like Yes, Genesis and
ELP. From the years 1977 on, one reason it was hard to find a positive review of
a progressive rock band was because most of them just weren't worth a
positive review.

But there was something else that was going on. The problem laid not
with the music itself, but with the critics themselves - the people
who earned a living writing about rock music.

You see, rock music critics do not really write about music. If you
read a review, you will see they are much more inclined to write
_around_ the music. Most music journalists haven't a lick of musical
training - certainly not enough to talk about music itself with any
precision. So you get an excessive focus on lyrics, which some bands
will freely admit are put in as an afterthought, combined with lots of
lifestyle critique.  As was succinctly described as Frank Zappa, rock
journalists were: " people who can't write, interviewing people who can't
talk, for people who can't read." Music? Not in the equation.

Probably the ultimate ur-critic of all of this is Lester Bangs, who
famously hated progressive rock from the beginning, right when his
fellow critics were praising it.  Part of it is people's taste - some
people just like their music more straightforward and don't like
competing melody lines and complicated arrangements. But the more you
read about it, the more you realize: prog rock - and more serious
music in general - just isn't very much fun to write
about. Journalists need a story; Lester Bangs knew how to tell a good
story; and prog rock _itself_ wasn't a good story. Outside of the
music, you were left with the scene - a crowd of geeky males absent
women which was just about The Worst Place in the World To Get
Laid. And you have the musicians, who are so serious about their work
that it makes it seem like _a job_. Who wants that?

Back to that book about the Strokes. Whatever you think of the band
(and I though they were just oh-KAY), they were obviously a lot of fun
to write about, enough to merit an entire dam book about the early
naughtie's music scene in the Lower East side as if it was a
fully-develped scene spawning dozens of great acts. This
mythologizing, I must remind everyone, is the exact OPPOSITE of the
truth I lived in New York at the time, even briefly living in the same
hallowed Lower East Side that was the epicenter of this scene. All I
remember were buzz bands and sold-out shows where the bulk of tickets
were given out to music journalists and assorted hangers-on.  If you
dig up some old Village Voice column from the time, you'll fact see
plenty of handwringing about the fact that New York City didn't have
ahave a vibrant original scene like Seattle! In fact, other than The
Strokes and The National, the musical acts at the time hardly
registered. So was this same anemic scene somehow, in hindsight, the
center of the musical world at the time?

Acts like The Strokes had to become big - because they were so much
fun to write about. These guys were Living The Rock And Roll
Dream. You can fill up a book with something like that. And THAT, my
friends, is what the rock music writers are looking for - not musical
values.

Meanwhile, nobody was worse to write about then Prog artists. Many bands,
such as Yes, were already in their thirties by the time they formed,
and the technical demands of the craft kept most of them too busy and
away from drugs and exciting parties with groupies. It didn't get any
fun until the mid-seventies, with the bizarre excesses that began
festooning the scene in the mid-seventies - bizarre spectacles like
Liztomania and Rick Wakeman's King Author's Court on ice. Given such
performances,  combined with a drop-off in quality from new records,
the fact that every big act in Britain in the mid-seventies seemed to
be going "proggy" and the fact that rock journalism became a
burgeoning industry fed by writers who tended to ignore the whole "music"
part of the equation, by the late seventies, the Lester Bangs school
was ascendant, and it became all schadefreude all the time.

Of course, none of this actually speaks to why people listen and why
the music has fans. And okay, _I get it_, there are valid reasons not
to like this stuff. The Beatles and Stevie Wonder were capable of
doing amazing, innovative music without losing the public in the
process, while groups like King Crimson seemed to take a perverse
delight imposing music of bewildering complexity on hapless
listeners. But the reason The Beatles remain adulated is because it's
friggin' hard to do. To fans of progressive rock, it's better to come
close to that peak and fail than it is to never try, and better to
create interesting music than provide yet another iteration of
blues-based AABA songs that doens't push the ball
forward.

But one point the critics have remains: a lot of prog was
bad. SERIOUSLY bad. To show how, let's take apart the discography of
one band who was not afraid to be labeled as proggy and pretentious:
Emerson Lake and Palmer. Let's go through the prog rock checklist:

* Dismissive of ordinary rock and roll: check
* Ludicrous stage getup: check
* Over-the-top Liberace-style virtuoso displays: check
* Disciplined logo imagery appearing on all merchandise: check
* Name worthy of a legal firm: check
* You secretly suspect all the band members hate each other: check

Their discography is a mess. ELP has one acknowledged masterpiece:
_Brain Salad Surgery_. They have two others that are legitimately
good, but not up to that high bar: _Trilogy_ and their epynomous debut. Another
one, _Tarkus_ is their own _Tales of Topographic Oceans" - beloved by
hardcore neckbeareded fans, and hated by everyone else. And finally,
they have a number of other mediocre recordings, mostly from the late
seventies and later, that bear no hint of the
brilliance of their best work.

Such discographies are unfortunately typical of prog acts. Yes
released three great albums over the span of less than three years,
and aside from that, had only a handful of albums of good quality over
the remainder of a career spanning *decades*. Genesis survived,
essentially, by becoming less prog; King Crimson was generally high
quality but wildly inconsistent; the list goes on. You aren't going to
find a streak like the Rolling Stones or the Beatles replicated here,
where a band puts together a half-dozen or more truly great
albums. Instead, the typical prog act produced a smattering of albums
that are truly great, a bunch more that are very
good... and a lot that just didn't wear that well.

As for you - if you're new to prog, then this actually makes it all
very easy for you. By now, there is considerable agreement on what is
*the best*. And the best, fortunately or unfortunately, are not
numerous.

Here are The Great Ones in no particular order, grouped by
artists. Note the years - almost all of this was early 1970s. I'm
picking those that are known nowadays as prog rock, those where both
the fans and the critics would agree "This is Prog". 

King Crimson:
_The Court of the Crimson King_ (1969)
_Red_ (1974)
_Discipline_ (1981)

Yes:
_Fragile_ (1971)
_Close to the Edge_ (1972)

Genesis:
_Selling England by the Pound_ (1973)

ELP:
_Brain Salad Surgery_ (1973)

Pink Floyd:
_The Dark Side of The Moon_ (1974)
_The Wall_ (1979)

Rush:
_Moving Pictures_ (1981)

and that, unfortunately, is it. I'm tempted to throw in Soft Machine's
_Third_ (1971), which should rightly be considered a great _jazz
fusion_ album, and Kate Bush's _The Kick Inside_ (1978), just to
clarify that the woman was just as prog as the rest. But that would be
it. The rest are good but not great - and yes, that means ELO, the
Moody Blues, Kansas, Camel, etc. The near misses like Kansas and
Camel, and the pop-oriented prog like ELO and Moody Blues, never
reached this artistic peak, and you'll rarely hear this in rotation
anymore. Much as I hate to say it, A Ramones album is just way more
fun than a prog acts that never do better than mediocre
(*coughcoughStyxcoughcoughcough*).

Is prog dead? Well, if you
scanned the best-of lists of the 2000s and 2010s, you would find a
shocking number of experimental, prog-like groups. Aside from the
normal post-rock suspects, you'd find quite a few - Sigur Ros,
Porcupine Tree, Tool and The Mars Volta - that are indistinguishible
from the prog aesthetic. Not to mention the whole post-Rock movement,
which started even earlier and continues with acts like Explosions in
the Sky. If anything, the first decated of the new
millenia produced more prog-like music in indie rock and metal than
the seventies did.

Yet none of these followers and imitators would ever be mistaken for
the "classic" prog of Yes, King Crimson and Genesis.  This definition
of "prog" as a movement barely extending for 10 years is perhaps as it
should be. Musically-challenging artists are always going to be with
us. But it is quite unusual for a genre to spontaneously arise
dedicated to its promulgation. It happened twice in jazz - first, with
be-bop in the 1940s, then with free jazz in the 1960s. In both cases,
the movements were lambasted as being too hard to follow and too
uncommercial; both were credited with "killing jazz"; both were said
to serve self-important musicians more interested in "art" than in
entertaining crowds. Both were lambasted by latter-day "Guardians of
the Tradition" as dead-ends that had to be purged. And both have
eventually come to be recognized as critics as two of the most
important innovations in jazz - essential movements within the field
responsible for pushing the genre out over-commercialization and
artistic dead ends - yammerings of Wynton Marsalis and Stanley Crouch
notwithstanding.

The fact that critics still bellyache do not keep todays newest
musicians from looking back at prog antecedents - no matter how much
they violate the holy trinity of "blues-based guitar music of simple
song forms." Indeed, the whole britpop and indie rock movements
dedicated to the canonization of guitar-based stripped-down post-punk
song forms, rather than enlivening the art form, were instead
responsible for simply producing a plethora of indistinguishable
sounding bands, none being substantially better than the other. This
happend to such an extent that a Guardian article dubbed an entire
genera "Indie Landfill."  Who is the next Oasis, the next Strokes, or
the next Arctic Monkeys?  Unfortunately, it hardly matters. All you
need is an album full of AABAs songs, 4 chords and a dream. If there
is a rock rebirth, the credit will not go to these acts, but to acts
who aren't afraid to lose fans by doing something a little creative.

Meanwhile, you have to give credit to bands like Yes and Soft Machine:
they set the bar so ridiculously high that we were never threathened
with "prog landfill" of buzz bands that came and went before the next
Christmas was up. Fans would rather spin _Fragile_ one more time than
waste time listening to a prog wannabe whose only credential was being
able to get their hands on a Mellotron. And that may mean having to
listen to the old guys if nobody releases anything new that's
decent. If that means being incredibly picky with new music, then hey,
it's my ears, and I'm going to take care of them.
