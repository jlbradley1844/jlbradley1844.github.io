## The Un-Christian Secret Behind the New Anti-Liberalism

This post is in response to some of the intellectual ferment on the conservative
side. Normally, I would greet any sign of intellectual life among the political
"right" in the current era as an unexpected, unalloyed good.

Let's set this straight: conservatism can be a respectable philisophy
and political outlook.
There are many "little c" conservatives throughout the United States.
By that, I mean, the sorts of people who fancy themselves as Burkean
conservatives, even though they have no idea what "Burkean" means. 
Far from the confines of talk radio with its thinly veiled
racism, jingoism and chauvinism, these are the sorts of conservatives that
middle-of-the-road establishment journalists imagine middle America to be
populated with.
Such conservatives are skeptical of governmental solutions - particularly
of the top-down nature. They are skeptical of change, particularly when it
appears to be change "for change's sake." And they are particularly concerned
about the enervating effects of secularism and media-driven antipathy
toward religion.

There is a lot to recommend to such an attitude, and were such people 
dominant within one of our political parties, the political situation in the
country would look a good deal different and a good deal better.

Many such people have figured out that conservatism has been ill-served by
its marriage of convenience with commercial interests. This was never a terribly
effective fit to begin with, anyway. The so-called "biblical family" doesn't
work out terribly well if two-family professionals manage to outbid all
the affordable property within reasonable commuting distance of the
"breadwinner" jobs that would support a family. Blue- and pink-collar
workers can't form families if the only jobs available to the non-degreed pay
too poorly to support an individual, let alone a family. You don't have time to
form a family and participate in church life if you're tethered to an
erratic, on-demand schedule imposed on you by your employer. Finally, 
the chamber-of-commerce
push of materialism and the consumer society has always been seen as
enervating to religious life.

My suspicion is that this
marriage of convenience was mainly due to the nature of Christianity in
America, particularly in the South where this marriage is strongest. 
The "low" protestant denominations overrepresented among conservatives
are run not by the pastors, but by the church board members themselves,
who generally came from the modern-day "petty 
bougois" of small-business owners, and they are ever sensitive to the needs
of their wealthiest members, whose donations are needed
to keep church budgets balanced. But eventually, the needs of
"big business" to appeal to increasingly secular and liberally-oriented
college graduates meant an actual rift with conservatism. And so here we
are with many conservatives not really wanting to represent "big business."
To this end, a number of conservative scholars have begun mapping out
a more consistent anti-liberal response - not just social liberalism, but
economic liberalism as well, particular the "race to the bottom" compitition
for wages and business regulations.

And so, many conservatives are re-evaluating their loyalty to economic liberalism
and thinking of economic support and protections for the workers supporting our society.
On paper, such developments, especially if reflected in their political counterparts,
would be great! This would appear to deliver an ideal respite to moderate voters
tired of seeing their economic concerns thwarted. This would deliver a corrective
to years of what has been one-sided victories for the business class.

Unfortunately, there are problems with this. The first, of course, is that
these are a bunch of intellectuals writing about conservatism, not politicians.
There is no guarantee that the politicians will follow.
However, from the position of this article, the problem is just what these
anti-liberal conservatives want to replace liberalism with. Rather than fix
the philosophies that gave rise to liberalism, they have instead decided
the problem was the enlightnment itself  - with its free thought, democracy
and equality for all. Many seem to believe one must burn down the entire
edifice in order replace this with a "religious" society.

Let's examine this a little further.
One thing that conservatives are uniform in is the defense of The Church, something
man enlightenement-era philosophies opposed. When
you ask them what is meant by "The Church," they will not specify a particular denomintation.
Many of these intellectuals are Catholic, but they are clear that they do not
mean the Catholic Church - particularly not now, with Pope Francis at the helm. No,
what they mean is some mythic traditional Church of The People - whatever that may
be. They do not specify what this is, but they seem pretty insistent that whatever
it is, it's supposed to be "biblical" (whatever that means) and above all, Christian.
It is also authoritarian and hierarchical; there are those that run society, and
the masses of people take orders not from civic authorities but from "The Church."

There are two very large problems with this.

The most obvious problem is the fact that by failing to specify a denomination, they have
not made things any simpler for anyone. There are some conservatives that are supporting
of reigion _as a concept_ in much the same way Baha'is are; e.g. defending religious denominations
on all stripes. That would be fine in and of themselves; Baha'is would even support such
a development. However, this is plainly not is what is going on. Most conservatives,
by their own admission, seek not just to disadvantage atheists and those of a secular
mindset, but many other faiths seen as "non-Western";
Buddhism, Hinduism, Paganism and above all Islam must take a back-seat to the Christian
religion, which is seen as far more authentically "Western". But here, too, you have an
even more significant problem - what do you do about Jews? Who, however much you may
pretend otherwise, have no interest in becoming more Christian, or complying with blue
laws, prohibitions on abortion and divorce, or feign social conformance on a 
host of other conservative issues? Indulge the Jews and
you appease many Jewish conservatives and, hopefully, purge charges of anti-semitism from
opponents of conservatism, But doing so creates an obvious intellectual loophole in your
entire edifice - one that seems especially odd for conservatives living in middle American
states with extremely low Jewish populations, who are still prone to see Jews as "outsiders."

However, the biggest problem with this newfound anti-Enlightenment thinkin is the 
religion they've chosen to defend: Christianity.

The problem is this "Jesus guy" and everything he said in the Gospels. One can found a
conservatives society on "Christianity"; even a revanchist society. Falangist Spain and
nineteenth century Ireland were deeply conservative, where many aspects of social order were
delegated wholely to the Catholic Church. However, if you don't specify a denomination,
you are left with just Jesus and the Gospels as the unifying force.

The core problem is this: Jesus' message isn't particularly conservative.
There's a reason the "red-letter" Christians tend to be of the more liberal ilk; because
so much of what Jesus himself is deeply un-conservative.

Which probably explains why, when you look at them deeply, many of these conservatives
aren't actually... terribly Christian. They love religion as a concept - in particular,
the social uniformity and order they imagine that it brings. But don't seem terribly engaged
in the religious teachings themselves. Indeed, a small but outspoken minority of
these particular movement concervatives not just unreigious, but eagerly espouse philosophies
known to be explicitly atheistic. Particularly the handful of very wealth people that
bankroll the think tanks funding this entire intellectual movement.
So with one hand, such backers wish to boost the standing of religion in society; and with
the other, they fight strenuously against antipoverty charities and advocates to refugee
resettlement, even those charities that are explicitly Christian in nature.
Which makes one wonder if a "Christian society" without Christ is really what they want.
