# The Uses of Philosophy

or

### Don't We Know Everything Already, Anyway?

I've of late been embarking on a study of philosophy. Part of this is
to fill in a void in my educational background - being in engineering
at a mediocre state school as an undegrad, I had little education in
the Liberal Arts; and graduate school in a STEM field won't help
matters. But there is a bigger question - what is philosophy good for,
anyway? How does it help the world, and more specifically, the causes
I'm interested in helping?

Philosophy itself is certainly not a field for popular study. It has a
reputation as being excessively pointy-headed. This can be seen in the
split between serious philosophy and books that sell as philosophy. If
you go into a large enough bookstore, it will have its own philosophy
section - mostly full of Penguin classics, books about atheism and its
defenders, and various readers. However, you are unlikely to see
anything "current" unless it happens to be either controversial or
only loosely concerned with philosophy. Someone, upon surveying this,
might think there are probably only a few conceivable goals one might
have to study philosophy. Perhaps one may do this to either appear
"well rounded" in conversation by familiarizing oneself with ideas of
import in the past, no matter how disregarded or unscientific these
ideas are. Or perhaps one has an antireligous interest; for such
people, the philosophy section seems to serve the same function as the
religious book section does for believers. Members of both groups want
to read books to assure themselves that they are right, and all those
_other people_ are stupid, evil or both.

I suppose the classical goals of philosophy are really the good ones -
the study of truth, self-examination, all that yada yada. But that is
something the field itself seems to have given up on, for some very
good reasons. Science seems to have claimed for itself the seat of
truth. Indeed, many scientists themselves believe there is now no use
of philosophy, just as there is no use to religion. If something is
emperically testable, then it is part of Science; if not, then it is
not the place for the study of truth. Given the developments in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth century, philosophy itself seemed
to assist in this effort, as positivists and analytic philosophers
heaped scorn on philosophical exercises like metaphysics and
nonemperical approaches, essentially leaving only scientifically
testable truths as the ones worth studying. If that is the case then,
perhaps philosophy is a decent place to learn how to form arguments,
think logically and properly conduct forensics; a worthy goal, but
hardly about finding grand truths.

But is that all there is? A way to improve one's argumentation, and
nothing more than a study of techniques? Much as the classical
sophists placed argumentation over actual truth, a modern student of
philosophy may be more interested in winning the argument and
persuading, actual truth and facts being besides the point. Here
again, as different set of twentieth century philosophers can assist
this effort, as many have assailed truth itself as a social construct,
perhaps imposed by those in power. And there have been other concerns
by philosophers that any attempt to establish truth definitively may
be harmful, if the end result is to attempt a final edifice to be
imposed upon poeple. While such arguments have some compelling moral
insights, the movement away from truth may give philosophy itself a
bad name. Indeed, I recently read an article on Brexit, which has
proven itself to be a bad idea sold through lies. Their theory was
that the British political class was heavily educated in philosophy
due to their elite background, producing a generation of "rotters"
whose main skill was at debating on their feet and hoodwinking people
in arguments instead of producing things of value; truth was never a
concern for such people. In any event, even the modest, utilitarian
goal of improved argumentation leaves a lot on the table; the "big
questions" philosophy used to address don't go away just because
science can't answer it easily.

A better approach may be to regard philosophy as invaluable tool in
the _search_ for truth. The American pragmatist school, though not
quite as influential than it was a century ago, still looms large, and
it has never claimed to be about the study of any single truth per se.
Instead, its focus is about how to search for and recognize truth.
Giving people the tools to be able to search for truth and recognize
errors is invaluable, and seems a far more noble an aim than simply
dominating others in verbal exchanges. And note that by the "search
for truth," I'm not talking about the solipistic tendency shared by
all to seek out confirming views of our existing biases; instead, I'm
talking about the tools for thinking critically about ones
pre-existing views and purge from them the errors that tend to creep
into the thinking of all.

Also, what does that mean for those who also study religion, which
also claims to be about some sort of truth? Well, a lot of
philosophers, particularly of the analytic persuasion, will say that
all religion is nonsense. Indeed, such philosophers sometimes seem
like frozen-in-amber copies of 18th century philosophers, railing at
The Church as if it still had the same power and sway over society as
it did in the middle ages. Meanwhile, other philosophers and
scientists (they aren't all atheists!) will tell you there are two
_magesteria_, such as they call it. Science is for the study of
certain verifiable truths, religion is for the study of certain truths
not illuminated by scientists, and perhaps philosophy is about how
these work together. But that doesn't really indicate how this works
in practice. It should stand to reason that if there is one reality,
there will be areas of practical overlap, in ethics and phenomenology,
for instance. Otherwise, the religion simply functions as a spackle
for areas of ignorance, to be slowly chipped away as science
progresses. Thus we get the atheistic scientists' "God of the gaps," a
God borne of ignorance that nobody believes in, but that atheists seem
to strongly believe the religious believe in.

I would like to put forth a different set of uses for philosophy:
* A tool to independent investigation of the truth
* A tool for shared, concrete understanding
* A tool for grappling with real problems of collective governance

This is mainly after the aims of the Baha'i Faith. Those who study the
Baha'i Faith have a genuine interest in philosophy, but their concerns
may be different than the typical student. Foundationally, Baha'i
doctrine insists on the concept of God as an unknowable entity. While
this makes its theology much closer to the "God of the Philosophers,"
it does presume that there are certain things of importance that
simply are unknowable. Actual knowledge of The Truth is seen to be
contingent as well, as all means of verification are faulty. So like
much contemporary philosophy, it does not think of the field as the
study of The Truth, so much as _investigation_ of the truth.

The above proposal, therefore, is that philosophy is of use for
investigating the truth, without settling it. Additionally, there are
aims for this search of truth; while settling truth for oneself may be
desired, it is necessary to commit to a path to truth that many can
collectively agree on. And likewise, that this must have proper aims;
under the Baha'i faith, the aim of the development of mankind,
civilization, and proper governance. Here, the philosophical basics
such as sound reason and agreement on known facts are of considerable
importance. Finally, the aims of he Baha'i Faith hold collective
governance as of special importance, making philosophical fields such
as ethics of particular importance.

## A Reading List of Contemporary Philosophy

To this end, I've tried to put together a reading list, mostly aimed
at "contemporary" philosophers. Why contemporary? Because the best way
to benefit from the field is to study it "as it is." Philosophy, like
science, not only builds on top of its own ideas, but tends to throw
out old ones as unworkable or inconsistent. While study of classic
philosophers are necessary, if only to understand what current
philosophers are talking about, it is necessary to be economical. Not
only is there a lot of old philosophy, much of it is now provably
wrong. While that may be true of some contemporary philosophy as well,
one at least has the benefit of assuming that many of the ideas
discussed are not quite proven wrong yet.

On the other hand, just _any_ reading list will not do. There is a
reason religious people - and many Baha'is - do not look to philosophy
as often as it should. For over a century, dominant strains of Western
philosophy were hostile not only to religion, but discussion of
spirituality of any form. Schools of emperical positivism in the late
ninteenth century, followed by the analyitic positivist who found
themselves dominant by the mid-twentieth century forced the entire
field of study to be nominally atheistic and suspicious, if not
downright hostile, to many of the ideals held dear so anyone of even
the slightest religious inclination.  This has not resulted in
writings that are erroneous per say; rather, it has shrunken the
concerns of philosopy only to statements of logic and emperically
testable facts, and an outright disdain for matters of metaphysics,
teleology and ethics.

Given that these matters are very much of concern to Baha'is - indeed,
to all non-philosophers - it is necessary to read a bit more
widely. Rather than identify philosophers whose writings are so
inimical to the spirit of Faith as to prove useless in the search for
truth and shared understandings, it is better to identify those that
are useful.


Analytic:

Analytic philosophers married empericism and verificationist
tendencies with hardcore mathematics. The goal, one imagines, was to
thrust rigor into philosophy and bring the scientific process to bear
to the field, along with all the advances that entailed. Unfortunately
many of the "greatest philosophers" acclaimed in the twentieth century
English speaking world - Bertrand Russel, Rudolph Carnap and the whole
Vienna circle were atheistic in outlook. While not all of them made
much of their atheism, the field in general remains hostile to
anything even mildly religious. Indeed, much of the reason so many
analytic philosophers wished away areas like metaphysics and
spirituality was because their unscientific nature was seen as an
encumberance to this cause. (It seems you can throw the baby out with
the bathwater if you have no patience for babies.)  Indeed, the modern
world view decried in _Century of Light_ had its foundations built by
analytic philosophers.

While this does not mean that all work in this field is in error -
there are plenty of theistic analytic philosophers that have built on
the works of prior atheistic philosophers - it does mean that their
focus is too narrow for someone wishing for tools to apply to their
own life or ideas for their own communities. It is all well and good
to use set theoretic formalisms to set down exactly what one means and
prove other things based on this, but quite another to try to draw
conclusions from them. As such, this reading list references those
that are either from "outsider" analytic philosophers who have
attempted to use these tools outside of the strict-verificationist
framework, or readings that are so foundational that one simply cannot
ignore them.



Bracketting early Analytic philosophy, and some notable exceptions in
the post-1950 period—for example, original and important work by
G.E.M. Anscombe, Peter Strawson,
Gareth Evans , Phillipa Foot,
Judith Jarvis Thomson, Harry Frankfurt, Rorty, Bernard Williams,
Brian O’Shaughnessy, Richard Wollheim, Derek Parfit,
John McDowell, Susan Haack, and a few others—good riddance to bad
rubbish.
