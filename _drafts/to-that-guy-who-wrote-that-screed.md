# Some REAL Advice to the Guy Who Wrote That Google Screed

So society has a problem. Every day it seems there are more angry male
clowns populating our society. Alt-right, gamergate, Proud Boys,
incels, you name it. Unhappy males claiming that they are victims of
conniving wimminfolk and femenazis who have overturned The Natural
Order. This also includes a male employee at a large technology
organization, whose name I shall not mention, that decided to dispute
his HR department's uncontrovertial role of outreach to women, armed
with nothing more than reams of tenditious research and [an
undiscolosed, unacknowledge right-wing support
system](https://www.wired.com/story/the-dirty-war-over-diversity-inside-google/)
(Not sure why companies like Google have outreach to women engineers,
maybe it's becaus they inexplicably make up half of the paid
workforce. Go figure.)

Inconcievably, such people think of themselves as victims. Ironically
they are. But not for the reason they think they are!

HENCE, THIS BLOG POST. People in alt-right thug
groups are almost beyond reaching, but some of their fellow travelers
are reachable. This blog post is not just to
[http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/08/07/google_fires_engineer_who_authored_anti_diversity_memo.html](that
guy). The guy who wrote
[https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320](this,
um, thing). I'm also talking to YOU, they hard-luck fella who is
unsuccessful and surrounded by other fellow-traveller single guys who
love to blame their problems on other people.
And this too is to any guy who has ever been contaminated by contact
with certain proponents of conservatism, or an aggressive strain of
"evolutionary psychology."

Yes, you're victims. But not vitims of feminists, "the left," or
whatever horesh!t bogeyman you are blaming for your
predicament. I don't think your problem is that you are discriminated
against, or that as a guy everyone overlooks your needs, or that
society no longer values men as necessary. So if you're still with me,
I know the root cause of why you're so upset:

Your problem is you aren't getting any. Amirite?

And lest you think the problem is more complicated, or nuanced, or
deeply thought than that, let's look at one of the mandates of The
Proud Boys, a group that combines all of these movements into an
organization with it's own, distinctive, uh, flavor. Here's what a
reporter said [in an article on a website on the more conservative
side](http://thefederalist.com/2017/10/06/proud-boys-and-porn/)

    [Proud Boys founder] Gavin wanted the guys to stop masturbating,
    go out, talk to women, and then marry them, procreate, be strong
    American family men, help restore the natural order of things that
    had been knocked out of wack by feminism...

So, yeah... sounds like the motivating factor is these guys just can't
get any.

So: this column. This is a very special column, mostly to single
men. It contains what I learned over so many years that you need to
know and do in order to be a male but also happy and single a the same
time. This is to any single male whose ignorance leads them to behave
in mistaken, jerk-like behavior that leaves them romantically unsuccessful.

I do not do this lightly. I was horrible with women for many years,
and I leared everything the hard way. For over fifteen years it was a
source of shame. Why did I suffer so? The reasons are legion, but it
would be selfish if failed to share the lessons I learned.  I'm
telling most guys because they usually figure this out after too many
years bumping around in the dark. And I'm telling the right-wingers,
gamergaters and incels, even though I personally don't like them,
since it is obvious they will continue making everyone miserable until
they "get some." I figure I'm helping society out by helping them
empty the garbage from their heads. And maybe single women will
benefit by the improved behavior of the men who read this.

But first, an important digression. To you edumacated single guys (and
that includes the self edumacated!), I want to delve into something
that may be making your problems much worse. Every movement has its
favorite pseudoscience, and a lot of guys, from the unhappy alt-right
basement dwellers to just as unhappy engineers and finance geeks have
their very own pseudoscience. This psychological movement claims to
explain why they are so unsuccessful in love, why femminism is so
*horrible*, and how they can become "winners" just by taking the "red
pill" of knowledge said to explain women and how to ~~conquer~~ pair
up with them. I need to demolish this pseudoscience before I get to
the good stuff.

### A Digression in to Evolutionary Psychology

Yes, evolutionary psychology. The intellectual jalopy of the
conservative male-rights movement.

Evolutionary psychology is an honest-to-goodness field, but if it did
not exist, it would have to be invented. It is a new field, some of
whose findings tend to conveniently line up with certain conservative
ideas about sex roles. In its less rigorous forms, it has appealed to
conservatives who use it as a crutch for their arguments, and
psychologists who have found that it helps them make money off of
unhappy single men.

Now about the Google guy and the alt-righters: look at any of their
writings and you will see tons of citations on evolutionar psychology.
It seems obvious why evolutionary psychology appeals to the more
classically "conservative" mindset, in that it presumes there are sex
roles fixed by Mother Nature that all adhere to. In the case of the
guy fired from google for writing this "anti-PC" screed that posits
why there are so few women working there as engineers, I'd bet that
evolutionary psychology studies are the source of most of the
"evidence" he cited in the screed that got him fired.

But that doesn't explain _why he read up on this stuff in the first
place_, and became educated enough in this field that that he had no
trouble heavily littering his manifesto with footnotes.

No, I'm sure the reason he read these articles originally it is the
main reason people buy the associated books - because they're looking
for help with dating. Now conservatives are especially susceptible to
this stuff becase they're already inclined to blame left-leaning
interests on causing everything from bad traffic to cloudy days. And
here they have a pseudoscience that claims the liberulz are keeping
them from getting laid! Motivated reasoning, here we come!

But these misbeliefs aren't just popular with conservatives; lots of
regular guys suffer under these delusions. Take it from someone who
knows. There is one - and only one - reason for reading evolutionary
psychology books, and it isn't because one is conservative, or
concerned with sexisim, or scientifically minded. It's because someone
is a man and they are unsuccessful at dating. And let's face it - if
it's one thing that unites the gamergate and the alt-right folk, it's
the fact that they're uniformly unsuccessful with women in every way.

If you, dear reader, aren't one of the unfortunates who have heard of
evolutionary psychology, let me tell you about it. As a pure
scientific field, it is legitimate, but it is still too embryonic to
draw conclusions from it.  Like a lot of soft science fields, there
are promising leads that vanish under replicated studies. However, as
a pop psychology field, its popularity is only matched by its
certainty in the face of a lack of definitive results. Like astrology,
it takes something based on hard science and spins it into a
pseudoscience intended mainly for extracting money from people.

I suppose evolutionary psychology started out like a lot of
pop-psychology fads do. In the 80s and 90s some psychologists found
some interesting things using rigorous, statistical experiments and
put some psychology theories in place. They posited that _some_ of
these effects may be due to evolutionary pressures. Most of these
sound kind of common sense, and focus on how women pick mates for
evolutionary matters; preferring symmetrical, physicially strong men,
for instance. So far, so good. Over time, though, you saw more books
appear which became less rigorous and more self-helpy as they found
their niche. Unlike most self-helpy books, these books didn't target
bookish women. They targeted men - mostly men who weren't getting
any. An apparently underserved market, and a lucrative one, given that
well-off lonely men are willing to part with their money to alleviate
the situation.

I don't know how things are in Silicon Valley, but I can hazard a
pretty good guess. I was in Austin in the nineties, and I expect that
from a social point of view, things were similar. And that was: too
many educated, well-paid geeky guys with not enough women to date. So
the place was full of "evolutionary psychologists" and "dating
consultants" looking to help guys get dates. It was a pretty
impressive grift. By posing as it does all sorts of indirect
mechanisms to explain things to men who haven't been successful with
women, you could convince you had secret knowledge that would be the
key to success for women. This was the holy grail to these poor guys,
who were usually convinced that the average Joe was getting it all the
time. These men were flummoxed, angry with themselves and angry with
the world. Anyone in this situation is liable to latch onto any theory
that seems to explain their suffering and give them a path to escape.

That's where the dating consultants came in. The consultants are just
more reputable-looking versions of the "Pick Up Artist" Jedi Masters;
while intellectually they should have nothing to do with one another,
the dynamic is the same:
* High-priced consultant tells you that you *should* be getting more
  dates;
* And that *he* can help you;
* But only if you follow his or her advice *exactly*;
* And if you are unsuccessful, you will be
  blameworthy because you did *not* following this advice.

A pretty unhealthy dynamic, but one that can make the consultant a lot
of mony at a hundred fifty dollars a session.

My experience was fortunately limited, but I expect it was typical. I
went to a single workshop in the early-nineties, a time when I was
also extremely unhappy about the way things were going for me
romantically. I was, like I supect all these guys are, extremely
unsuccessful. I was concerned that my failure would continue
indefinitely, and if I didn't change things I would blow whatever
chance for happiness I had. So I was a ready mark for this
grift. Fortunately, I had a creepy sense something wasn't right, but
it was mostly dumb luck that I didn't get taken in; at the time, my
b.s.-detector was not nearly as good as it should've been in my late
twenties, and I read several books that still pollute my mind thirty
years later.

### SO, TO THAT GUY: HERE'S YOUR REAL PROBLEM

The reason your missive created such a firestorm is not P.C. gone
amok, but instead due to a classical Computer Science problem:

    Garbage in, garbage out. 

Fortunately, the problems evolutionary psychology sets out to explain
have much simpler causes and solutions. Such simpler explainations may
even give you the help you need; these explain much of the behavior
you see socially, much better than any pseudoscientific nonsense that
are liable to offend masses of people once set to paper. Additionally,
by embracing this knowledge, you don't have to rely on neo-Nazis and
Klansmen for emotional support. You can talk to, like, normal people.

What are these things I am talking about?  Having started in college
as extrordinarily unsuccessful and fighting my way to the other side
over twenty years. I am now going to recap some things you need to
know. None of it is based on evolutionary psychology; all of them are
things I wish somebody told me.

These pointers will no guarantee you success, but they will allow you
to be much happier. Think of them as "table stakes"; they won't make
winning inevitable, but at least you aren't shut out of the game.

So, with that out of the way, here's what I learned, and what you must
know in order to be both happy and single:

## 1. There is no "friend zone" or "nice guy" penalty. Acting like a jerk
will get you nowhere.

Let's start this list by also demolishing a cherished myth of the PUA
scene.

Here is a simple explanation of how the world works that not only
explains how the real world works, but gives much more respect to
women. There are 4 types of guys:

1. Attractive guys who are nice guys
2. Attractive guys who are jerks
3. Less-attractive guys who are nice guys (the largest group)
4. Less-attractive guys who are jerks

Women are attracted to men in category 1 and 2.  You aren't in the friend
zone; you're in category 3.  There is no way to change it. So if you
react by becoming an assertive jerk, you don't put yourself in
category 2; you put yourself in category 4.

As John Hodgeman would say, "you're welcome."

And if you're a woman (and why on earth are you reading this?), most
category 1 men are taken, most category 2 men are not, and that's why
so many of men you find attractive and available are jerks, in spite
of the fact that most men are not jerks.

## 2. For men: your mid-twenties are going to be your
  WORST years dating. Steel yourself.

The following explains why so many guys - the majority in fact - feel
if they aren't tall, good-looking or ridiculously successful, the odds
are somehow stacked against them, as they spend too much time in too
many brewpubs populated by too many dateless women and too many
sausagefest music festivals and mixers.

A lot of guys leave college and take their baby-face with them to
their first job, in the city or suburb. If they move to take a job,
then they are having to rebuild their social scene. Doing so is much
more difficult than in college, where there were lots of built-in
mechanisms for meeting other people.

One problem is that techniques that used to work in college suddenly
get a lot less effective. If you're in this position, you suddenly
find out you don't have a lot of places to hang out. You probably have
no place you naturally meet people of the opposite sex. On top of
that, it seems your luck with women have changed for the worse. The
obvious cause: FEMINISM.

LOL.

No. The cause is a change in environment. One that penalizes men much
more than women.

Now, this isn't just men - women actually have a tough time too. When
you have to rebuild your entire social environment, it's a tall
order. Depending on where you live, it could be tough to make
friends. Someplace with tons of "churn" like Austin is easy; it's harder in
a settled metropolis like Philadelphia where it seems everyon grew up
there. But in any event, it's hard. For both men and women.

However, women don't have as steep a hill to climb; in particular, if
you are an _attractive_ woman, or even merely cute, you will be
approached, given invitations, and generally find it easy to "get in
circulation." Additionally, women have something your young male peers
do not have - attention from a lot of older men. Indeed, a woman of
ages 22-35 is seen as dateable to virtually _any_ single men.

What about young men? Don't older women also like them? Well, you hear
a lot about "cougars"; but in practice, the fact that a label like
"cougar" exists means that this outside of the norm, while the word
for a man who finds younger women attractive is "man." There will not
be enough cougars to even the odds.

The upshot is that even if you live in someplace like New York City,
which is notoriously overpopulated with single educated women, you
actually will have a much tougher time in your mid-twenties that young
women with a similar level of attractiveness will. So just hang
tough. When someone tells you that you should have no problems,
_ignore them_. Your biggest problem is the idea that it should be
easy. _It isn't going to be easy._

## 3. Physical cues matter a lot. But there's nothing you can do about
   them.

Guys are notoriously shallow. Women are less shallow, but only by
comparison. They want tall and good-looking. If you're neither, you're
out of luck. One you can do nothing about; the other is only
marginally under your control.

A lot of self-help books and men's magazine articles will tell you
that height doesn't matter nearly so much as self-confidence. Truth
is, I have yet to hear a woman complain that her blind date was too
lacking in self-confidence, whereas the most common complaint is "he's
too short!" However, the self-help books are correct, in that you
can't focus on that, because that isn't under your control. At least
if you act confident, no one will think you're whining or feeling
sorry for yourslef. Your best bet is ignore people that tell you that
you should be having no problems or tell you to try different lines or
insipid nonsense like that. Assuming you have reasonable social
skills, it is not about technique. It is about luck. Best to
reconcile yourself to your situation instead of blaming yourself for
something not under your control.

The good news here is that if you aren't unusually short and don't
have a face like Elephant Man, then you're still in the game. Once
women are in their late twenties, they are usually are reconciled to
the fact they won't get everything they desire, looks-wise. (Contrast
that with all the guys in their thirties who still won't look at a
woman who weighs more than a hundred fifteen pounds.) You don't need
all the women to come around; all you need is one.

## 4. Fixing your personality will help more than anything. But don't
  count on it giving you the success you want now; it will later.

The reason here is twofold. First, you can't change your height, and
aside from good grooming, you're only going to improve your appearance
marginally. But you can do something about your personality. And if
you're reading alt-right forums, your personality needs plenty of
fixing.  In addition to this, working on yourself, with the help of a
psychologist, counselor, or whoever, is going to take YEARS of patient
work to bear fruit. It may well be worth it.

Are you in your mid-twenties? Congratulations! That means by
the time women are closing in on thirty and are starting to give
guys like you second looks, you might actually have enough of a
personality to be deserving of their attention! So if you're personality
isn't awesome, start now.

## 5. Toxic masculinity is toxic to both you and others. Avoid carriers.

I like using the phrase "toxic masculinity" because it ticks off
people who wonder how can you have too much manliness, but toxic is
the right word for an attitude that poisons both the carrier and those
he comes in contact with. Here's a sample of toxic beliefs about
masculine behavior, often passed down from man-to-son, or perhaps
douche-bro to douche-bro.

* You need sexual experience to become a man.

* Your worth is determined by sexual conquests. Indeed, the number of
  sexual conquests is how you tell if you're "winning" at life.

* Not only are your sexual conquests proof of your manliness,
  increasing your manliness will conversely lead to more sexual conquests.

* Easy sexual conquests will boost your self-confidence and make
  you more attractive to women.

* You will not look like a "real man" if you don't bring a girl home with
  you for Christmas/Thanksiving/whatever.

* It's all about confidence, and if you're unsuccessful, it's because
  you're acting too much like a wimp. You have to be persistent and
  not take no for an answer so easily.

You can see why these beliefs are toxic to anyone with two 'X'
chromosomes; it leads you to view all women of childbearing age as
targets, or at best, trophies to be won and put aside afterward.

But the believers are victims too. It least you to believe nasty
things about yourself as a person, nasty things about what you have to
do succeed, and leads to a nasty self-image due to romantic failings
that may be due to things you have little control over. After all, you
have no control over your age, you have no control over your height,
you have limited control over how desireable women find you - yet the
beliefs of toxic masculinity insist that this is all just a matter of
the right attitude, agression and bullheaded persistence. Those are
fine things for winning a marathon, but you don't "win" people. The
opposite is very much the case, and holding these beliefs will make
you desparately unhappy and incline you toward thoughtless actions
that will make you even less likely to succeed in life.

So you need to ditch these. And a hint - if you hang out with a bunch
of guys who uses the term "pussy" to make fun of other guys, probably
best if you change who you hang out with.

## 6. Take all advice with a grain of salt.

## 7. To engineers especially: You might not need a change in
  attitude. You might need a U-Haul instead.

This is a biggie. Some of the hippest, hottest places with tight job
markets are tech heavy-areas like Seattle, San Francisco, Boston and
Austin. Fun places, right? Lot's of "churn"; e.g. newcomers looking to
make friends instead of still hanging out with buddies from high
school. Easy to make friends, lots of things to do, so many bars with
fifty beers on tap to choose from. Awesome dating scene, right?

Unfortunately, places with "churn" tend to be bad places for guys, as
they're more likely to move for professional opportunities. On top of
this, technology draws men far more disproportionately. If you are an
engineer and are not naturally attractive, think twice before settling
in one of these areas; it may gut your romantic prospects. If you do
move there, figure on giving yourself a few years and if things go
bad, move. Do *not* let people tell you your difficulties are abnormal
and you need to worry about "technique" or "self-confidence." Your
difficulties are to be expected. In some of these places, professional
men outnumber professional women by almost 3 to 2 - and the ratio of
_unattached_ single men to women will be much worse. The more
attractive women will quickly pair up, leaving the bars full of
unhappy men in the midst of 3-year-long dating dry spells. Treat your
cities like you treat your bars: if there's no women there, leave.

## 8. The "chick advice" books are correct: concentrate on growing a social
  life. Just don't expect it will immediately help your dating.

A lot of dating advice books, particularly those aimed at women, will
tell you to concentrate on "growing a life"; e.g. becoming more
fulfilled professionally and socially, and that things will otherwise
right themselves. If you're a young twentysomething woman, that is
absolutely true. Attractive women can have dry spells, but generally
if they do, it's because of something unhealthy in their life; one
that is fixed, opportunities can flower.

As a man of middling looks, this may notnecessarily fix things for
you, but it's the least you can do. It will make you happier and
well-adjusted, and you'll be in much better shape to take advantage
when opportunities do occur. The basement-dwelling gamergate folk and
Proud Boy clowns are doing the opposite of what you want to do; you
need to fix yourself socially before you can expect to even begin to
succeed.

## 9. Persistence pays, but you have to persist at the right things!

Some of the most horrible advice I ever had was to be persistent. From
friends, psychologists, books, you name it. "Did a woman seem
hesitant? Hound her for her number." "Do you like her but is she
avoiding you? Maybe she's shy and playing hard to get." In short, a
lot of advice books for men tell you to be pushy and a bit like a
jerk.

Acting like this will backfire. It will get you the sort of
stiff-armed rejections that will send you to the basement to sulk for
for days, and probably leave your targeted lady so creeped out she
vents to her friends about it for weeks. I've never in my life found a
woman who seemed cold to my advances who suddenly changed one day and
started flirting with me because I wouldn't give up. It just doesn't
happen. Instead, I just acted like a jerk and felt horrible about
myself later.

You have to persist at other things: persist at working on yourself,
persist at meeting as many people as possible, and persist at
maintaining a good attitude instead of giving up. You have to count on
spending hours sending out hundreds of introductions on the dating
sites and not getting discouraged when they only result in two or
three in-person meetings.  Saying that "all the good ones are taken"
isn't going to help you. If you fix what you can, as I listed above,
you are going to do a lot for yourself, and the end can result in
success. But could just take a few years.

------------------------

And that's it. I hope I can better someone's life in some way, and
maybe, just maybe, keep some unhappy man from inflicting pain on some
unhappy woman. And maybe instead make someone else happy for ahcnage.

I can't say I had the success I wanted, but it all worked out in the
end; I'm happily married. However, I married much later in life than I
wanted to. If someone had outlined this advice for me, I probably
would've married earlier and been much happier. I would've made other
people happier. I would've ticked off a lot fewer people and dumped my
sense of being a victim. Hopefully I can inspire someone to dump their
evolutionary psychology books in the trash and do something that makes
them happy. And as far as those of you who browse alt-right sites?
Well, if "fat drunk and stupid is no way to go through life," think of
how much worse is it for someone to voluntarily associate themselves
with the obsolete dung-heap of the 20th century. Want to hold your
head up high with dignity, like a "real man"? Start acting on
dignified beliefs.
