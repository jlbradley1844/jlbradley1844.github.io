#Some REAL Advice to the Guy Who Wrote That Google Screed

The problem is this guy is honestly a victim. But not for the reason
he thinks he is. HENCE, THIS BLOG POST. This section is not just to
[http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/08/07/google_fires_engineer_who_authored_anti_diversity_memo.html](that
guy). The guy who wrote
[https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320](this,
um, thing).

Instead, this is to any guy who has ever been contaminated by contact
with certain proponents of an aggressive strain of "evolutionary
psychology."

Note the irony quotes.  Yes, you're victims. But not
vitims of feminists, "the left," or whatever horesh!t bogeyman you are
blaming for your predicament.

I'm gonna guess you aren't getting it a whole lot. Amirite?

Take it from someone who knows. There is one - and only one - reason
for reading evolutionary psychology books. It isn't because you're
conservative, concerned with sexisim, or scientifically minded. It's
because you're unsuccessful at dating. And let's face it - if it's one
thing that unites the gamergate and the alt-right folk, it's the fact
that they're uniformly unsuccessful with women in every way.

If you, dear reader, aren't one of those unfortunates, let me tell you
about evolutionary psychology books. Evolutionary psychology sounds
like science, but it isn't.  It is a form of pop psychology. As a pure
scientific field, it is still too embryonic to draw conclusions from
it; as a pop psychology genre, well... it would be kind to the field
to say it lacks rigor.

I suppose it started out like a lot of pop-psychology fads do. In the
80s and 90s some psychologists found some interesting things using
rigorous, statistical experiments nd put some psychology theories in
place. They posited that _some_ of these effects may be due to
evolutionary pressures. So far, so good. Over time, of course, the
books became less rigorous and more self-helpy. However, unlike most
self-helpy books, these books didn't target bookish women. No, they
targeted men - mostly men who weren't getting any.

I don't know how things are in Silicon Valley, but I can hazard a
pretty good guess. I was in Austin in the nineties, and I expect that
from a social point of view, things were similar. To wit: too many
educated, geeky guys with not enough women to date. So the place was
full of "evolutionary psychologists" and "dating consultants" looking
to help guys get dates. It was a pretty impressive grift.

Now it seems obvious evolutionary psychology appeals to the more
classically "conservative" mindset, in that there are sex roles fixed
by Mother Nature that are enforced. These ideas explain why he wrote
the screed that got him fired. But that doesn't explain why he _read
up on this stuff in the first place_, enough that he had no trouble
heavily footnoting his manifesto with footnotes. No, I'm sure the
reason he read these books originally it is the main reason people buy
the book - because they're looking for help with dating.

Unfortunately, evolutionary psychology is a bit of a racket. It poses
all sorts of indirect mechanisms to explain things to men who haven't been
successful with women, usually men who think average Joe's are somehow
much more successful. These men are flummoxed, angry with themselves and
angry with the world. Anyone in this situation is liable to latch onto
any theory that seems to explain their suffering _and_ give them a
path to escape. That's where the dating consultants come in. The
consultants are about three degrees removed from the "Pick Up Artist"
scene; while on the surface they have nothing to do with one another,
the dynamic is the same:
* High-priced consultant tells you that you *should* be getting more dates;
* And that *he* can help you;
* But only if you follow his or her advice *exactly*;
* And if you are unsuccessful, you will be blameworthy because you did *not*
following this advice.

A pretty unhealthy dynamic, but one you can make a lot of money from
at a hundred dollars a session.

My experience was limited, but I expect it is typical. I went to one
workshop in the early-nineties, a time when I was also extremely
unhappy about the way things were going for me romantically. I was,
like I supect this guy is, extremely unsuccessful. I was concerned,
then in my mid-twenties and going into my late twenties, that my
failure would continue indefinitely, and if I didn't change things I
would blow whatever chance for happiness I had. Fortunately, something
kept me from buying into it. It was mostly dumb luck that I didn't get
taken in; at the time, my bullsh!t-detector was not nearly as good as
it was now.

SO, TO THAT GUY: HERE'S YOUR REAL PROBLEM

The reason that missive created such a firestorm is due to a classical
CS problem:

garbage in, garbage out. 

Fortunately, the problems evolutionary psychology sets out to explain
have much simpler causes and solutions. Such simpler explainations may
even give you the help you need. These things explain much of the
behavior you see socially, much better than any pseudoscientific
nonsense that are liable to offend masses of people once set to
papter. Additionally, by embracing a more mainstream viewpoint, you
don't have to rely on neo-Nazis and Klansmen for emotional
support. You can talk to, like, normal people.

## 1. For professional men: your mid-twenties are going to be your
  WORST years dating.

A lot of guys leave college and take their baby-face with them to
their first job, in the city or suburb. If they move to take a job,
then they are having to rebuild their social scene. Doing so is much
more difficult than in college, where there were lots of built-in
mechanisms for meeting other people.

One problem is that techniques that used to work in college suddenly
get a lot less effective. You don't have a lot of places to hang
out. You probably have no place you naturally meet people of the
opposite sex. Things get a lot harder. On top of that, it seems your
luck with women have changed for the worse. The obvious cause:
FEMINISM.

LOL.

No. The cause is a change in environment. One that penalizes men much
more than women.

Now, this isn't just men - women actually have a tough time too. When
you have to rebuild your entire social environment, it's a tall
order. Depending on where you live, it could be tough to make
friends. Someplace with tons of "churn" like Austin is easy; it's harder in
a settled metropolis like Philadelphia where it seems everyon grew up
there. But in any event, it's hard. For both men and women.

However, women don't have as steep a hill to climb; in particular, if
you are an _attractive_ woman, or even merely "cute", you will be
approached, given invitations, and generally find it easy to "get in
circulation." Additionally, women have something your young male peers
do not have - attention from a lot of older men. Indeed, a woman of
ages 22-35 is seen as dateable to virtually _any_ single men.

What about young men? Don't older women also like them? Well, you hear
a lot about "cougars"; but in practice, the fact that a label like
"cougar" exists means that this outside of the norm, while the word
for a man who finds younger women attractive is "man." There will not
be enough cougars to even the odds.

The upshot is that even if you live in someplace like New York City,
which is notoriously slanted against single educated women, you
actually will have a much tougher time in your mid-twenties that young
women are. So just hang tough. When someone tells you that
you should have no problems, _ignore them_. Your biggest problem is the
idea that it should be easy.

## 2. The only thing the field has correct: height matters a LOT

There is much in the way of self-help books telling you that height
doesn't matter nearly so much as self-confidence. Truth is, I have yet
to hear a woman complain that her blind date too lacking in
self-confidence, whereas the most common complaint is "he's too
short!" However, the self-help books are correct, in that this isn't
anything you can do anything about. I personally never tried hacks
like shoe lifts, and I'm not sure they help. Your best bet, here
again, is hang tough and ignore people that tell you that you should
be having no problems or tell you to try different lines or insipid
nonsense like that. Assuming you have reasonable social skills, it is
not about technique.

## 3. Fixing your personality will help more than anything. But don't
  count on it giving you the success you want.

The reason here is twofold. First, you can't change your height, and
if you're are reasonably well-groomed, there is little to be done
here. But you can do something about your personality. And if you're
reading alt-right forums, your personality needs plenty of fixing. But
in addition to this, working on yourself, with the help of a
psychologist, counselor, or whoever, is going to take YEARS to bear
fruit. Are you in your mid-twenties? Congratulations! That means by
the time women are closing in on thirty and are starting to give
guys like you second looks, you might actually have enough of a
personality to be deserving of their attention.

## 4. There is no "friend zone" or "nice guy" penalty. Acting like a jerk
will get you nowhere.

This is the biggest reason the PUA scene is so obviously wrong. I'll
give you a much simpler explanation of how the world works that gives
much more respect to women.

There are 4 types of guys:

1. Attractive guys who are nice guys
2. Attractive guys who are jerks
3. Less-attractive guys who are nice guys
4. Less-attractive guys who are jerks

Women are attracted to category 1 and 2.  You aren't in the friend
zone; you're in category 3.  There is no way to change it. So if you
react by becoming an assertive jerk, you don't put yourself in
category 2; you put yourself in category 4.

As John Hodgeman would say, "you're welcome."

## 5. To engineers especially: You don't need a change in attitude. You need a
  U-Haul.

This is a biggie. Some of the hippest, hottest places with tight job
markets are tech heavy-areas like Seattle, San Francisco, Boston and
Austin. Fun places, right? Lot's of "churn"; e.g. newcomers looking to
make friends instead of still hanging out with buddies from high
school.

Unfortunately, places with "churn" tend to be bad places for guys, as
they're more likely to move for professional opportunities. On top of
this, technology draws men far more disproportionately. If you are an
engineer and are not naturally attractive, think twice before settling
in one of these areas. If you do move there, figure on giving yourself
a few years and if things go bad, move. Do *not* let people tell you
your difficulties are abnormal and you need to worry about "technique"
or "self-confidence." Your difficulties are to be expected. In some of
these places, professional men outnumber professional women by almost
3 to 2. In such an environment, the more attractive women will quickly
pair up, leaving the bars full of unhappy men in the midst of
3-year-long dating dry spells. Treat your cities like you treat your
bars: if there's no women there, leave.

## 6. The "chick advice" books are correct: concentrate on growing a social
  life. Just don't expect it will immediately help your dating.

A lot of dating advice books, particularly those aimed at women, will
tell you to concentrate on "growing a life"; e.g. becoming more
fulfilled professionally and socially, and that things will otherwise
right themselves. If you're a young twentysomething woman, that is
absolutely true. Attractive women can have dry spells, but generally
if they do, it's because of something unhealthy; having a balanced
life allows opportunities to flower. As a man of middling looks,
this won't necessarily fix things for you. But it's the LEAST
you can do. The basement-dwelling gamergate folk are doing the
opposite of what you want to do; you need to fix yourself socially
before you can expect to even begin to succeed.

## 7. Persistence pays, but you have to persist at the right things!

Some of the most horrible advice I ever had was to be persistent. Did
a woman seem hesitant? Hound her for her number. Do you like her but
is she avoiding you? Maybe she's shy and playing hard to get. In
short, a lot of advice books for men tell you to be pushy and a bit
like a jerk. That is just going to get you the sort of rejections that
will send you to the basement for the next two years. I've never in my
life found a woman who seemed cold to my advances who suddenly changed
one day and started flirting with me because I wouldn't give up. It just
doesn't happen. Instead, I just acted like a jerk and felt horrible
about myself later.

Instead, you have to persist at working on yourself, as meeting as
many people as possible, and generally on not getting hopeless and
giving up. You have to count on spending hours sending out hundreds of
introductions on the dating sites and not getting discouraged when they
only result in two or three in-person meetings.  Saying that "all the
good ones are taken" isn't going to help you. If you fix what you can,
as I listed above, you are going to do a lot for yourself, and the end
can result in success. But it will take a few years.

------------------------

I can't say I had the success I wanted, but it all worked out in the
end; I'm happily married. However, I married much later in life than I
wanted to. If someone had outlined this advice for me, I probably
would've married earlier and been much happier. I would've made other
people happier. I would've ticked off a lot fewer people and dumped my
sense of being a victim. Hopefully I can inspire someone to dump their
evolutionary psychology books in the trash and do something that makes
them happy. And as far as those of you who browse alt-right sites?
Well, if "fat drunk and stupid is no way to go through life," think of
how much worse is it for someone to voluntarily associate themselves
with the obsolete dung-heap of the 20th century.
