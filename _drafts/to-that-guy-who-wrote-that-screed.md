# Some REAL Advice to the Guy Who Wrote That Google Screed

So society has a problem. Every day it seems there are more angry male
clowns populating our society. Alt-right, gamergate, Proud Boys, incels, you
name it. Unhappy males claiming that they are victims of conniving
wimminfolk and femenazis who have overturned The Natural Order.

Inconcievably, such people think of themselves as victims. Ironically
they are. But not for the reason they think they are!

HENCE, THIS BLOG POST. People in alt-right thug
groups are almost beyond reaching, but some of their fellow travelers
are reachable. This blog post is not just to
[http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/08/07/google_fires_engineer_who_authored_anti_diversity_memo.html](that
guy). The guy who wrote
[https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320](this,
um, thing). I'm talking to YOU, they hard-luck fella who is
unsuccessful and surrounded by other fellow-traveller single guys who
love to blame their problems on other people - or the opposite,
successful guys looking to "fix you."
And this too is to any guy who has ever been contaminated by contact
with certain proponents of conservatism, or an aggressive strain of
"evolutionary psychology."

Yes, you're victims. But not vitims of feminists, "the left," or
whatever horesh!t bogeyman you are blaming for your
predicament.

I'm gonna guess you aren't getting it a whole lot. Amirite?

I have knowledge that will help you men out. But first, I want to
delve into something that may be making your problems much
worse. Every movement has its favorite pseudoscience, and a lot of
guys, from the unhappy alt-right basement dwellers to just as unhappy
engineers and finance geeks have their own - a psychological movement
that claims to explain why they are so unsuccessful, why femminism is
so *horrible*, and how they can become "winners" just by taking the
"red pill" they offer to them. I need to demolish this pseudoscience
before I get to the good stuff.

### A Digression in to Evolutionary Psychology

Evolutionary psychology is an honest-to-goodness field, but if it did
not exist, it would have to be invented. It is a field that, rather
conveniently, lines up with certain conservative ideas about sex
roles. In its less rigorous forms, it has appealed to conservatives
who use it as a crutch for their arguments, and psychologists who have
found that it helps them make money off of unhappy single men.

Now about the Google guy and the alt-righters: it seems obvious
evolutionary psychology appeals to the more classically "conservative"
mindset, in that it presumes there are sex roles fixed by Mother
Nature that all adhere to. In the case of the guy fired from google
for writing this "anti-PC" screed that posits why there are so few
women working there as engineers, the evolutionary psychology ideas
may back up what he wrote in the screed that got him fired. But that
doesn't explain why he _read up on this stuff in the first place_, and
became educated enough that that he had no trouble heavily footnoting
his manifesto with footnotes.

No, I'm sure the reason he read these books originally it is the main
reason people buy the book - because they're looking for help with
dating. Now conservatives are especially susceptible to this stuff
becase they're already inclined to blame left-leaning interests on
causing everything from bad traffic to cloudy days. And here they have
a pseudoscience that claims the liberulz are keeping them from getting
laid! But these misbeliefs aren't just popular with conservatives;
lots of regular guys suffer under these delusions. Take it from
someone who knows. There is one - and only one - reason for reading
evolutionary psychology books. It isn't because one is conservative,
or concerned with sexisim, or scientifically minded. It's because
someone is a man and they ahre unsuccessful at dating. And let's face
it - if it's one thing that unites the gamergate and the alt-right
folk, it's the fact that they're uniformly unsuccessful with women in
every way.

If you, dear reader, aren't one of the unfortunates who have heard of
evolutionalry psychology, let me tell you about evolutionary
psychology books and consultants. As a pure scientific field, it is
legitimate, but it is still too embryonic to draw conclusions from it.
Like a lot of soft science fields, there are promising leads that
vanish under replicated studies. However, as a pop psychology field,
its popularity is only matched by its certainty in the face of a lack
of definitive results. Like astrology, it takes something based on
hard science and spins it into a pseudoscience intended mainly for
extracting money from people.

I suppose evolutionary psychology started out like a lot of
pop-psychology fads do. In the 80s and 90s some psychologists found
some interesting things using rigorous, statistical experiments and
put some psychology theories in place. They posited that _some_ of
these effects may be due to evolutionary pressures. Most of these
sound kind of common sense, and focus on how women pick mates for
evolutionary matters; preferring symmetrical, physicially strong men,
for instance. So far, so good. Over time, though, you saw more books
appear which became less rigorous and more self-helpy as they found
their niche. Unlike most self-helpy books, these books didn't target
bookish women. They targeted men - mostly men who weren't getting
any. An apparently underserved market, and a lucrative one, given that
well-off lonely men are willing to part with their money to alleviate
the situation.

I don't know how things are in Silicon Valley, but I can hazard a
pretty good guess. I was in Austin in the nineties, and I expect that
from a social point of view, things were similar. To wit: too many
educated, well-paid geeky guys with not enough women to date. So the
place was full of "evolutionary psychologists" and "dating
consultants" looking to help guys get dates. It was a pretty
impressive grift, posing as it does all sorts of indirect mechanisms
to explain things to men who haven't been successful with
women. Usually men who are under the impression average Joe's are much
more successful than they are. These men are flummoxed, angry with
themselves and angry with the world. Anyone in this situation is
liable to latch onto any theory that seems to explain their suffering
and give them a path to escape.

That's where the dating consultants come in. The consultants are just
more reputable-looking versions of the "Pick Up Artist" Jedi Masters;
while intellectually they should have nothing to do with one another,
the dynamic is the same:
* High-priced consultant tells you that you *should* be getting more
  dates;
* And that *he* can help you;
* But only if you follow his or her advice *exactly*;
* And if you are unsuccessful, you will be
  blameworthy because you did *not* following this advice.

A pretty unhealthy dynamic, but one you can make a lot of money from
at a hundred dollars a session. Indeed, it looks a lot like any grift
designed to relieve you of money.

My experience was fortunately limited, but I expect it was typical. I
went to a single workshop in the early-nineties, a time when I was
also extremely unhappy about the way things were going for me
romantically. I was, like I supect all these guys are, extremely
unsuccessful. I was concerned that my failure would continue
indefinitely, and if I didn't change things I would blow whatever
chance for happiness I had. So I was a ready mark for this
grift. Fortunately, I had a creepy sense something wasn't right, but
it was mostly dumb luck that I didn't get taken in; at the time, my
b.s.-detector was not nearly as good as it should've been in my late
twenties, and I read several books that polluted my mind.

### SO, TO THAT GUY: HERE'S YOUR REAL PROBLEM

The reason that missive created such a firestorm is due to a classical
Computer Science problem:

    Garbage in, garbage out. 

Fortunately, the problems evolutionary psychology sets out to explain
have much simpler causes and solutions. Such simpler explainations may
even give you the help you need; these explain much of the behavior
you see socially, much better than any pseudoscientific nonsense that
are liable to offend masses of people once set to paper. Additionally,
by embracing this knowledge, you don't have to rely on neo-Nazis and
Klansmen for emotional support. You can talk to, like, normal people.

What are these things I am talking about?  Having started in college
as extrordinarily unsuccessful and fighting my way to the other side
over twenty years. I am now going to recap some things you need to
know. None of it is based on evolutionary psychology; all of them are
things I wish somebody told me. These pointers will no guarantee you
success, but they will allow you to be much happier. Think of them as
"table stakes"; they won't make winning inevitable, but at least you
aren't shut out of the game.

## 1. For men: your mid-twenties are going to be your
  WORST years dating. Steel yourself.

A lot of guys leave college and take their baby-face with them to
their first job, in the city or suburb. If they move to take a job,
then they are having to rebuild their social scene. Doing so is much
more difficult than in college, where there were lots of built-in
mechanisms for meeting other people.

One problem is that techniques that used to work in college suddenly
get a lot less effective. You don't have a lot of places to hang
out. You probably have no place you naturally meet people of the
opposite sex. Things get a lot harder. On top of that, it seems your
luck with women have changed for the worse. The obvious cause:
FEMINISM.

LOL.

No. The cause is a change in environment. One that penalizes men much
more than women.

Now, this isn't just men - women actually have a tough time too. When
you have to rebuild your entire social environment, it's a tall
order. Depending on where you live, it could be tough to make
friends. Someplace with tons of "churn" like Austin is easy; it's harder in
a settled metropolis like Philadelphia where it seems everyon grew up
there. But in any event, it's hard. For both men and women.

However, women don't have as steep a hill to climb; in particular, if
you are an _attractive_ woman, or even merely "cute", you will be
approached, given invitations, and generally find it easy to "get in
circulation." Additionally, women have something your young male peers
do not have - attention from a lot of older men. Indeed, a woman of
ages 22-35 is seen as dateable to virtually _any_ single men.

What about young men? Don't older women also like them? Well, you hear
a lot about "cougars"; but in practice, the fact that a label like
"cougar" exists means that this outside of the norm, while the word
for a man who finds younger women attractive is "man." There will not
be enough cougars to even the odds.

The upshot is that even if you live in someplace like New York City,
which is notoriously overpopulated with single educated women, you
actually will have a much tougher time in your mid-twenties that young
women will. So just hang tough. When someone tells you that
you should have no problems, _ignore them_. Your biggest problem is the
idea that it should be easy. _It isn't going to be easy._

## 2. Physical cues matter a lot. But there's nothing you can do about
   them.

Guys are notoriously shallow. Women are less shallow, but only by
comparison. They want tall and good-looking. If you're neither, you're
out of luck. One you can do nothing about; the other is only
marginally under your control.

There is much in the way of self-help books telling you that height
doesn't matter nearly so much as self-confidence. Truth is, I have yet
to hear a woman complain that her blind date too lacking in
self-confidence, whereas the most common complaint is "he's too
short!" However, the self-help books are correct, in that this isn't
anything you can do anything about. Your best bet, here again, is
ignore people that tell you that you should be having no problems or
tell you to try different lines or insipid nonsense like
that. Assuming you have reasonable social skills, it is not about
technique. It was about luck. Best to reconcile yourself to your
situation than blame yourself for something not under your control.

The good news, here, is that if you aren't unusually short and don't
have a face like Elephant Man, then you're still in the game. Once
women are in their late twenties, they are usually are reconciled to
the fact they won't get everything they desire looks-wise. Contrast
that with all the guys you know who won't look at a woman who weighs
more than a hundred fifteen pounds. You don't need all the women to
come around; all you need is one.

## 3. Fixing your personality will help more than anything. But don't
  count on it giving you the success you want now; it will later.

The reason here is twofold. First, you can't change your height, and
if you're are reasonably well-groomed, there is little to be done
here. But you can do something about your personality. And if you're
reading alt-right forums, your personality needs plenty of fixing.
In addition to this, working on yourself, with the help of a
psychologist, counselor, or whoever, is going to take YEARS to bear
fruit.

Are you in your mid-twenties? Congratulations! That means by
the time women are closing in on thirty and are starting to give
guys like you second looks, you might actually have enough of a
personality to be deserving of their attention! If you're personality
isn't awesome, start now.

## 4. There is no "friend zone" or "nice guy" penalty. Acting like a jerk
will get you nowhere.

This is the biggest reason the PUA scene is so obviously wrong (if you
don't know what PUA stands for, consider yourself blessed). I'll
give you a much simpler explanation of how the world works that gives
much more respect to women.

There are 4 types of guys:

1. Attractive guys who are nice guys
2. Attractive guys who are jerks
3. Less-attractive guys who are nice guys (the largest group)
4. Less-attractive guys who are jerks

Women are attracted to category 1 and 2.  You aren't in the friend
zone; you're in category 3.  There is no way to change it. So if you
react by becoming an assertive jerk, you don't put yourself in
category 2; you put yourself in category 4.

As John Hodgeman would say, "you're welcome."

And if you're a woman (and why on earth are you reading this?), most
category 1 men are taken, most category 2 men are not, and that's why
so many of men you find attractive and available are jerks, in spite
of the fact that most men are not jerks.

## 5. Toxic masculinity is toxic to both you and others. Avoid carriers.

I like using the phrase "toxic masculinity" because it ticks off
people who wonder how can you have too much manliness; and indeed,
toxic is the right word for people who have it - it poisons both the
carrier and those he comes in contact with. However, it's actually a
horribly meaningless term. It's come to be a slander that means
whatever the speaker wants it to mean, like "racist" or "fascist" or
"Patriots fan." So here's some toxic beliefs that fall under this
heading, frequently passed down from man-to-son, or perhaps douche-bro
to douche-bro.

* You will not look like a "real man" if you don't bring a girl home with
  you for Christmas/Thanksiving/whatever.

* You need sexual experience to become a man.

* Your worth is determined by sexual conquests. Indeed, the number of
  sexual conquests is how you tell if you're "winning" at life.

* Not only are your sexual conquests proof of your manliness,
  increasing your manliness will conversely lead to sexual conquests.

* An easy sexual conquests will boost your self-confidence and make
  you more attractive to women.

* It's all about confidence, and if you're unsuccessful, it's because
  you're acting too much like a wimp. You have to be persistent and
  not take no for an answer so easily.

You can see why these beliefs are toxic to anyone with two 'X'
chromosomes; it leads you to view all women of childbearing age as
targets, or at best, trophies to be won and put aside afterward.

But the believers are victims too. It least you to believe nasty
things about yourself as a person, based on experiences you actually have
little control over. You have no control over your age, you have no
control over your height, you have limited control over how desireable
women find you - yet the beliefs of toxic masculinity insist that
this is all just a matter of the right attitude, agression and
bullheaded persistence. Those are fine things for winning a marathon,
but you don't "win" people. The opposite is very much the case, and
holding these beliefs will make you desparately unhappy and incline you
toward thoughtless actions that will make you even less likely to
succeed.

So you need to ditch these. And a hint - if you hang out with a bunch
of guys who uses the term "pussy" to make fun of other guys, probably
best if you change who you hang out with.

## 6. Take all advice with a grain of salt.

## 7. To engineers especially: You don't need a change in attitude. You need a
  U-Haul.

This is a biggie. Some of the hippest, hottest places with tight job
markets are tech heavy-areas like Seattle, San Francisco, Boston and
Austin. Fun places, right? Lot's of "churn"; e.g. newcomers looking to
make friends instead of still hanging out with buddies from high
school. Easy to make friends, lots of things to do, so many bars with
fifty beers on tap to choose from.

Unfortunately, places with "churn" tend to be bad places for guys, as
they're more likely to move for professional opportunities. On top of
this, technology draws men far more disproportionately. If you are an
engineer and are not naturally attractive, think twice before settling
in one of these areas. If you do move there, figure on giving yourself
a few years and if things go bad, move. Do *not* let people tell you
your difficulties are abnormal and you need to worry about "technique"
or "self-confidence." Your difficulties are to be expected. In some of
these places, professional men outnumber professional women by almost
3 to 2 - and the ratio of _unattached_ single men to women will be
much worse. The more attractive women will quickly
pair up, leaving the bars full of unhappy men in the midst of
3-year-long dating dry spells. Treat your cities like you treat your
bars: if there's no women there, leave.

## 8. The "chick advice" books are correct: concentrate on growing a social
  life. Just don't expect it will immediately help your dating.

A lot of dating advice books, particularly those aimed at women, will
tell you to concentrate on "growing a life"; e.g. becoming more
fulfilled professionally and socially, and that things will otherwise
right themselves. If you're a young twentysomething woman, that is
absolutely true. Attractive women can have dry spells, but generally
if they do, it's because of something unhealthy in their life; one
that is fixed, opportunities can flower.

As a man of middling looks, this may notnecessarily fix things for
you, but it's the least you can do. The
basement-dwelling gamergate folk and Proud Boy clowns are doing the
opposite of what you want to do; you need to fix yourself socially
before you can expect to even begin to succeed.

## 9. Persistence pays, but you have to persist at the right things!

Some of the most horrible advice I ever had was to be persistent. From
friends, psychologists, books, you name it. "Did
a woman seem hesitant? Hound her for her number." "Do you like her but
is she avoiding you? Maybe she's shy and playing hard to get." In
short, a lot of advice books for men tell you to be pushy and a bit
like a jerk.

Acting like this will backfire. It will get you the sort of
stiff-armed rejections that will send you to the basement to sulk for
the next two years, and probably leave a woman so creeped out she
vents to her friends. I've never in my life found a woman who seemed
cold to my advances who suddenly changed one day and started flirting
with me because I wouldn't give up. It just doesn't happen. Instead, I
just acted like a jerk and felt horrible about myself later.

Instead, you have to persist at working on yourself, as meeting as
many people as possible, and generally on not getting hopeless and
giving up. You have to count on spending hours sending out hundreds of
introductions on the dating sites and not getting discouraged when they
only result in two or three in-person meetings.  Saying that "all the
good ones are taken" isn't going to help you. If you fix what you can,
as I listed above, you are going to do a lot for yourself, and the end
can result in success. But it will take a few years.

------------------------

I can't say I had the success I wanted, but it all worked out in the
end; I'm happily married. However, I married much later in life than I
wanted to. If someone had outlined this advice for me, I probably
would've married earlier and been much happier. I would've made other
people happier. I would've ticked off a lot fewer people and dumped my
sense of being a victim. Hopefully I can inspire someone to dump their
evolutionary psychology books in the trash and do something that makes
them happy. And as far as those of you who browse alt-right sites?
Well, if "fat drunk and stupid is no way to go through life," think of
how much worse is it for someone to voluntarily associate themselves
with the obsolete dung-heap of the 20th century.
