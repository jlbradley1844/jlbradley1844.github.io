#Some Advice to the Guy Who Wrote That Google Screed

OK, this is not just to [http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/08/07/google_fires_engineer_who_authored_anti_diversity_memo.html](that guy). The guy who wrote [https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320](this, um, thing).

This is to any guy who have ever read a bunch of books on
"evolutionary psychology."

Note the irony quotes.
Yes, you're victims. But not vitims of feminists, "the left," or
whatever horesh!t bogeyman you are blaming for your predicament.

I'm gonna guess you aren't getting it a whole lot. Amirite?

Take it from someone who knows. There is one - and only one - reason
for reading evolutionary psychology books. It's because you're
unsuccessful at dating.

If you aren't one of those guys, let me tell you about evolutionary
psychology books. Evolutionary psychology sounds like science, but it isn't.
It is a form of pop psychology. It would be kind to
the field to say it lacks rigor. I suppose it started out like a lot
of pop-psychology fads do. In the 80s and 90s some psychologists found some
interesting things using rigorous, statistical experiments
nd put some psychology theories in place. To
figure out why things were, they posited that _some_ of these effects
may be due to evolutionary pressures. So far, so good. Over time, of
course, the books became less rigorous and more self-helpy. However,
unlike most self-helpy books, these books didn't target bookish women. No,
they targeted men - mostly men who weren't getting any.

I don't know how things are in Silicon Valley, but I can hazard a
pretty good guess. I was in Austin in the nineties, and I expect that
from a social point of view, things were similar. To wit: too many
educated, geeky guys with not enough women to date. So the place is
full of "evolutionary psychologists" and "dating consultants" looking
to help guys get dates.

That's right. People who read evolutionary psychology are generally
guys who can't get dates. You would think, from the tone of
victimization in the screed, that evolutionary psychology appeals to
conservatives. But that explains why _that guy_ felt the need to write
it, and why he didn't bother to think things through. Besides,
conservatives aren't real hot on this whole "science" and "reading"
thing. They certainly wouldn't read tons of pop-psychology from
one of those, you know, bookstores. No, guys who are into evolutionary
psychology are reading because they're desperate.

Unfortunately, evolutionary psychology is a bit of a racket. It poses
all these weird mechanisms to explain things to men who haven't been
successful with women, usually men who think average Joe's are somehow
much more successful; they are flummoxed, angry with themselves and
angry with the world. Anyone in this situation is liable to latch onto
any theory that seems to explain their suffering _and_ give them a
path to escape. That's where the dating consultants come in. The
consultants are about three degrees removed from the "pick up artist"
scene; while on the surface they have nothing to do with one another,
the dynamic is the same:
* high-priced consultant tells you that you *should* be getting more dates
* and that *he* can help you
* but only if you follow his or her advice *exactly*
* and if you are unsuccessful, it will be blamed on you *not*
following this advice. 
A pretty unhealthy dynamic, but one you can make a lot of money from
at a hundred dollars a session.

I suspect my experience was typical I went to one workshop in the
early-nineties, a time when I was also extremely unhappy about the way
things were going for me. I was, like I supect this guy is, extremely
unsuccessful. I was concerned, then in my mid-twenties and going into
my late twenties, that my failure would continue indefinitely, and if
I didn't change things I would blow whatever chance for happiness I
had. Fortunately, something kept me from buying into it. It was mostly
dumb luck that I didn't get taken in; at the time, my
bullsh!t-detector was not nearly as good as it was now.

SO, TO THAT GUY: HERE'S YOUR REAL PROBLEM

The reason you sent out that missive that created a firestorm -
garbage in, garbage you. You read all these books without the
slightest moiety of skepticism, skepticism you had no trouble engaging
when you tuned out those mandatory HR sessions everyone else sits
through. As a result, you wound up delivering what seems like an
underresearched manifesto, delivering what you felt was proof, but
instead proving nothing that you'd lived in a bubble. Evolutionary
psychology was your problem.

Fortunately, the problems evolutionary psychology sets out to explain have much
simpler causes and solutions.

I am instead setting out to single frustrated men early in their
career what you should be thining of INSTEAD. These things explain
much of the behavior you see socially, much better than any
pseudoscientific nonsense.

##1. For professional men: your mid-twenties are going to be your
  WORST years dating.

A lot of guys leave college and take their baby-face with them to
their first job, in the city or suburb. If they move to take a job,
then they are having to rebuild their social scene. Doing so is much
more difficult than in college, where there were lots of built-in
mechanisms for meeting other people.

One problem is that techniques that used to work in college suddenly
get a lot less effective. You don't have a lot of places to hang
out. You probably have no place you naturally meet people of the
opposite sex. Things get a lot harder. On top of that, it seems your
luck with women have changed for the worse. The obvious cause:
FEMINISM.

LOL.

No. The cause is a change in environment. One that penalizes men much
more than 

##2. The only thing the field has correct: height matters a LOT


##3. Fixing your personality will help more than anything. But don't
  count on it giving you the success you want.


##4. To engineers: You don't need a change in attitude. You need a
  U-Haul.


##5. The "chick books" are correct: concentrate on growing a social
  life. And don't expect it will help your dating.


##6. Persistence pays, but you have to persist at the right things!



I can't say I was ever "successful." I did marry, much later in life
than I wanted to. But if someone had outlined this advice for me, I
probably would've married earlier and been much happier. I would've
made other people happier. I would've ticked off a lot fewer people
and dumped my sense of being a victim. Hopefully I
can inspire someone to dump their evolutionary psychology books in the
trash and do something that makes them happy.
