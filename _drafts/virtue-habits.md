# The Keystone Habits of Virtue Improvement

Who among us doesn't want to be a better person?

As I'm writing this, the New Year's has passed some three weeks
ago. That means resolutions. That means in the weeks before, there
will be a spate of articles in papers of record and glossy magazines
about how to make your resolutions stick. In the first weeks, many
will make resolutions and attempt to stick to them. Vegetables will be
purchased, gymns will be joined, people will put "swear jars" on their
desks. Office workers will go to work earlier, and leave earlier to be
with their families. And if you're a regular gym rat, you'll noticed
that the gym floor and aerobics classes are suddenly overflowing.

Those are the just the resolutions we can see. Then there are various other
resolutions people have - the one that are really difficult to work
on. People telling themselves they'll be kind, or that they'll keep
their temper in check. Married men or women who tell themselves they'll improve
attention to their partner. While not visible to us, these are serious
struggles as well. If anything, this is even more salutory. And in
theory, these don't require large committments in time or weird
dietary changes.

And what will happen as a result of these resoltuion?

The only one I know about firsthand is gym
attendance, as an irregular gym rat. I usually attend a gym close to
work, and I dread the coming of January. By the second week, the
locker room is twice as full, the floor hardly has any room, the
classes are overflowing. But I've learned over the years that by
mid-February, things will be back to the way they were.

The irony is that resolving to adopt a regular workout routine is
probably the most easy resolution to pull off. That is, if you've made
proper plans. You create a workout schedule schedule, and (important!)
drop things from your schedule that would compete with this. If your
slogan for success is "just do it," then here you go - this is one
where you really can "just do it." Yet the attendance trends tell the
truth - most of these resolutions won't work out. Even for those who
aren't already overscheduled.

So much for resolutions where the efforts are visible. What about the
efforts to become a better person? To improve one's relationships? To
be kinder, or more assertive, or reach out more often? Aren't these
even more important? Unfortunately, you can't to go the gym to work on
those. Instead, the plan most people have is _try_. Try to be
better. Try to be more honest. Try.

What are the odds that's going to work out?

If the only plan you have is to _try harder_, that isn't a plan. Here
is the first time (and hopefully the last) where I quote from Star
Wars:

	"Do, or do not. There is no try."   -- Yoda

Without a plan, your resolution will be forgotten as quickly as a you
forget an uplifting epigram from a fortune cookie. It will last as
long. And unlike the resolution, you won't feel guilty when you
realize what your fortune cooke said.

No, the problem is you don't have a plan. _Try_ is not a plan. Aren't
there plans for these things?

## Improvement of Virtue

Supposing one of your resolutions is of the "try to be a better
person" variety. Fortunately, people have thought about that. But to
do that, you have to identify what the problem is.

When someone says they want to be a better person, it usually means
one wishes to be more *virtuous*.

Virtue has a somewhat religious connotation, and is frequently bound
up with such ideas as spirituality, holiness, purity, belief and such
things. In many cases, virtuous conduct is seen as being synonymous
with ethical behavior. All of these may be true. But when someone says
they want to "be a better person," they usually aren't thinking of
that.

Instead, they're thinking about a specific character strength or
virtue that they wish to exhibit better. One can certainly become more
kind, loyal, forgiving; less wrathful, stressed-out or jealous, right?
All of these it should be possible to improve, without veering into
discussons of religious doctrine. Yet, if you Google "virtue," most of
the conversations are dominated by religious discussions. Assertions
of the true believers aside, this seems like no way to help
someone. If someone who wants to be more forgiving, the effort should
be on improving that - not on telling them they need to "bring Christ
into their life" or "get in touch with their fifth chakra." And people
who seem to enjoy giving out advice like that should know that not only
is such advice not actionable, it seems aimed at helping you with your
problem rather than helping others with their problem. The same goes
for certain sorts of psychologists who, given any problem, will
instead spend a year discussing your family history in therapy
instead. Spiritual paths, "spirit guides," therapists; all can be
helpful. That isn't a plan, and it confuses the means with the aim.

Fortunately, there are those who have written about virtue, and how to
improve it, without bringing in any particular path.

Aristotle may not have invented the concept of virtue, nor perfected
its definition. But in his great work _Nicomanchean Ethics_, he has
given one of the most useful conceptualizations of virtue. I find it
particularly useful exactly because it is untethered from any
particular spiritual tradition.

One important principle is that he conceives as goodness in
general as also being moral goodnes and idential to wisdom:

   ... virtue is not merely a state in conformity with the right
   principle, but one that implies the right principle; and the
   right principle in moral conduct is prudence.

In other words, goodness in a person _is_ virtue. Aristotle defines
this virtue as being the prudent golden mean between two
extremes. While one may agree with his definition or disagree, this
ideal of good conduct and virtuous conduct would ring true for anyone
wishing for self-improvement.

But what distinguishes someone who is virtuous? It is the person's
habits. A virtuous person is one of whose habits are of a virtuous
nature:

   Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act
   rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have
   those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do.
   Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.

Want to be a "better person"? It requires acquiring the habits of a
"better person"!

Easy, right?

You may suspect I'm sarcastic. Everyone knows habits are hard to
change. Everyone knows someone who has been trying to give up
cigarettes, or trying give up a Ben & Jerry's habit, or trying to cut
back on time on Facebook. Habit changing is hard. But at least it can
be done. Look at the two resolutions below, and see which one is better:

  "I will try to keep my temper in check and swear less."

  "I will develop the habits necessary to keep my temper in check."

The first one sounds like a New Year's resolution of a teenager. It
will not succeed. Worse yet, someone may convince themselves "well, at
least I tried." Unfortunately, the only way that could be considered a
success is if the purpose of the resolution
was just to feel better about yourself.

The second one is more likely to result in a substantial
change. Unfortunately, it is going to require a lot more work.

So what does it take to form a habit?

## Underlying Habits of Virtue

I'm going to borrow an idea from business literature. It has to deal
with goal-setting. I'll skip over the background and just dive
straight in. To be achievable, a goal should be SMART:
