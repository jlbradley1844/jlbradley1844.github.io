# Interdictions: for the Virtue Killers

As one works on self improvement, one is normally going to find a
number of things that one has to "give up." Maybe the way you want to
improve is to give up something - for instance, if your
self-improvement goals include a healthy diet, this may mean a number
of things. You might give up your breakfast doughnut, or your
mid-afternoon snack, or a few other things.

It may be that you actually need to set interdictions for
yourelf. That is, things that are so bad for your own habits, that you
decide you can no longer improve while indulging these in the least. These may be things that are so antithetical to what you are
attempting to accomplish that it no longer makes sense to even
consider it.

A brief, amusing example. My wife joined weight-watchers some time
back. As she told me, weight-watchers has a "points" system, where you
count points instead of calories. This encourages you to eat certain
food, as not all calories are the same. Fruits and vegetables are zero
(0) points - essentially, eat all you want. Obviously, these have
calories; but it's set to zero to encourage people to eat these. They
don't outlaw certain food explicitly, but you'll find certain food has
no points listed. Certain yummy food - like ice cream. Ice cream
doesn't appear; if you ask, they'll tell you it has "infinite"
points. In other words, you are never allowed to eat it. The
interdiction on ice cream exists because, in their view, there are
always healthier alternatives to indulging oneself in this
manner. Eating ice cream is considered so antithetical to your main
goal that it is not allowed. Fortunately, I am not on weight watchers.

Then there are things that in themselves may not be directly opposed
to your goals, but interfere with achieving them in other ways. For
instance, in my twenties I knew people who have tried to cut back on
alcohol, and to assist themselves in that goal, have actually made the
decision to cut back socializing with certain friends. Why? Because
hanging out with those friends always resulted in a night of
alcohol-fueled stupidity. Or supposing you have decided you want to
improve your mood. You may give up alcohol if drinking makes you
depressed. Or you may give up ice cream if your depression triggers a
binge-eating ice cream episode, leading to more depression.

So it's pretty common to set interdictions for oneself.

Now this isn't necessarily where you _start_, is it? Supposing one
resolves to become a better person; say, you want to increase your
courage. You're going to come up with a list of things to do to
improve courage... say, maybe a) take one new risk a day; b) pick up a
hobby that will increase exposure to something you'd normally be
afraid of doing; c) maybe get a little therapy to help; and so on. You
aren't going to pick up a list of things *not* to do. That seems
entirely besides the point.

Even if your resolution is to "give up something"; e.g. the
interdiction itself is the resolution, you probably aren't going to be
successful by focusing on that. Instead, what psychologists say is
more effective is to pick up an alternate habit and stick with
it. To give up smoking, for instance, people are told to get a
different habit that will let them get out and socialize, to replace
the ritual break they get from smoking.

However, it's important to emphasise that this generally isn't where
one starts. Consider it an advanced technique. The way it would
normally work for self-improvement is:

* First, you pick up an initial regimen for self improvement. You
  apply it and start to notice it working.

* As you proceed, you increase the difficulty. You begin noticing your
  weak points and focusing on those. You start to find certain
  roadblocks.

* After a while, you notice that there are certain roadblocks to
  self-improvement that keep coming up; bad habits that keep
  repeating. Say, too much time on Facebook, too much TV, too many
  trips to the coffeeshop whatever. You then decide that you must give
  those up - set an interdiction on yourself.

So the interdiction is generally the last thing you do - although you
may have a suspicion that your goals require you to give up something
from the offset.

And yet...

... when people thing of religions, what do they think of? The
interdictions!

It should be evident based on the order in which I've been discussing
things that the most important part of the Baha'i moral code are what
I'd call the "positive" the teachings; that is, the things you do that
make you a better person.

So why do they even have these interdictions?

For the same reason you yourself might invent interdictions - because
they interfere with your goals. Religions, as a whole, have their goal
in the betterment of one's virtues; it would stand to reason that
there are certain things that are troublesome enough, given the matrix
of the culture within which it was revealed, that these took
place. To my mind, they are not as powerful as the positive teachings,
but are hazardous to ignore.

## Suggestions on Some Interdictions

The Baha'i Faith has a number of interdictions. These interdictions
are themselves framed as "a protection" for those practicing
them. Personlly, I find it the only reasonable way to frame it, and
I've been uncomfortable when others frame it in any other way. I've
been in meetings, where I've seen people actually thumping the
Kitab-i-Aqdas and bellowing "peoplee must abide for the laws God has
revealed to us in This Day!" That's true and all - for everone who
already agrees with such a statement. And therefore, doesn't need the
reminder. For the millions of others who are not, I'd be surprised if
any one of those millions who were exposed to that message would
instantly be convinced of the rightness of this stateument.

I'm not sure what the reason is for that attitude; it certainly isn't
unique to any one religion. It could be that some people think virtue
is to be attained solely on the basis of avoiding certain
things. Perhaps some who hold closely their religion but wish to do a
bare minimum for their own personal growth wish to focus on literal
fulfillment of laws only. In any event, focus on the interdictions
without a focus on the positive teachings or why the interdictions are
in place loses the entire reason for its being. I tend to agree with
the writings of a certain Jewish carpenter who had some strong
feelings about people who practice strict religious law without any
adherence to the spirit of the law.

But this is an aside. Another way to understand this was stated by a
friend who was completely irreligious and made a point about Baha'i
Law that I remember to this day. Having been about Baha'i about a
year, I told a mutual acquaintance that I could not drink beer, and
when pressed, I said it was due to a religious law. My friend said
something to the effect "No, you are _choosing_ to follow that law,
you could break it if you wanted to." And indeed I have not, at least
not intentionally. (Although to be technical, I imbibed accidentally a
few months ago. My wife bought a badly-labeled craft root beer for me,
unaware it had alcohol in it; I knew on the first swig that it had
alcohol - quite a bit. Fortunately, one gulp wasn't enough to do
anything to me.)

So with that, I would like to _suggest_ certain interdictions that can
be adopted to help with one's path to improved virtues - whatever the
specific virtue. These are the "thou shalt nots..." that have helped give
religious thought a bad rap, but given the good they do, it would be
irresponsible not to mention them.

The Baha'i Faith interdicts many activites. I'm just going to list the
most notable and unusual for the western (American) cluture; these are
some of the onces that have provided me, personally, the most benefit
in my own growth. Consider it part of your "advanced" workout
routine. Your challenge, should you accept it, is to refrain from the
following activities:

1. The consumption of addictive or habit-forming substances that impair mental
function (including alcohol, but NOT including tobacco/nicotine and caffeine)

2. Extramarital sexual activity

3. Gambling

4. Backbiting

5. Participation in partisan political activities

Now the Baha'i Faith actuall interdicts many others. There are dozens
listed in the primary repository of "Baha'i Law," a tome called the
Kitab-i-Aqdas (literally: "The Most Holy Book"). The bulk of the
remaining interdictions are either obvious (e.g. killing, calumny) or
either narrow in nature or less germane to the sort of "educated
Westerns" that are likely to be reading this; e.g things such as:
* ascetism
* mendicancy (i.e. begging as a profession)
* kissing of hands to show obesiance
* shaving one's head (particularly as a form of penitence)
* pluralty of wives
* bathe or shower once a week (!) (whether you need it or not, I guess)
and so forth.
This is the sort of thing that blows out the main text of the
Kitab-i-Aqdas to 190 paragraphs of text. A highly recommended read,
but not necessary to entirely recap here.

All five of these interdictions deserve their own consideration. But
to write at length would loes the focus, which is to develop one's
virtues. While I have my own personal reasons for believing these are
all useful for one's development, it would be self-indulgent to spend
time attempting to prove these to others, scientifically or not,
unless I can present it in a way that helps one reach their goals,
without interpreting it in "innovative" ways.
