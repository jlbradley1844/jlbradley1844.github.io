# A Recap: Why Might a Virtue Workout Work

I have offered up a mechanism, based on what I and numerous others are
doing every day, that I think _should_ work. This was worked out by
careful study of classical philosophy, religious study, and the Baha'i
Writings. However, skeptical reader might still indeed
wonder _why_ it might work. What are the mechanisms by
which it might work?

Someone of more traditional religious indoctrication,
may believe this viewpoint is silly. "You're praying for X, God is
going to give you X if it's good for you, since you're praying for
something that's good for you you're going to get it! No?" Such a
thing may not convince many readers, and it certainly doesn't convince
me - and I'm religious! To this day I remain very skeptical of
"itercessionary prayer" as conceived by most religious people. Lacking
that mechanism, why would prayer actually help you? Indeed, why would
meditation or any of the other mechanisms help you?

If you're a Baha'i you may be a bit more skeptical, but you would
certainly be onboard the program. Baha'is are more likely than most to
believe religious laws are intended to produce virtuous conduct and
should be interpreted. Indeed, it permeates their outlook on religion,
and their outlook on all religions, not just their own:

    ...the purpose of religion is the acquisition of praiseworthy
    virtues, betterment of morals, spiritual development of mankind,
    the real life and divine bestowals.
    -- Abdu'l-Baha (Foundations of World Unity, p. 15


However, if you're skeptical about prayer, you're probably skeptical
about religion too. So that won't fly for you; you want hard
proof. How can one get it?  To answer this, it is necessary to take a
step back and see what is happening when one is "trying to be a better
person." I alluded to these machanics in an earlier post.

Unfortunately, I'm not well read on what the research is in this
field. It certainly hasn't made a splash in the magazines and blogs I
read. One would think that reading about virtue may make you more
virtuous; likewise, focusing on self-examination should help. But
without emperical evidence, it's just a claim. And about prayer - it
is usually tested for material effecacy; e.g. Templeton Foundation
studies where people pray for healing, or to grow beans in a pot. Not
exactly what we want to study.

What has been studied is mindfulness. This may be because of the
activities, this is the most easy to replicate. It consists of a
process, it makes specific claims about outcome, and you can easily
adapt it to secular ends. And while many scientists have tried to
debunk it, the worst they can say is while "the science is still out", it
does seem to have an effect. So there's that.

Meanwhile if science does show any of these programs of self-improvement
have an effect, I'm confident what the key behind its success
is.

The key is self-reflection.

If one had zero capacity for self-reflection, then there would be no
desire to become a better person. Why? Because there would be no
identification of any flaws in one's behavior! Someone who wants to be
a better person has an inkling that something, somewhere, there is
something wrong with one's behavior. These realizations could take
many forms; let's think of some situations many of us have been in:

* You do something habitutally; afterward, you realize this was
  something you shouldn't have done and felt guilty about it.

* You run into a stressful situation that requires you to be patient
  and thoughtful; instead you lose your cool and later regret it.

* In response to a tough day at work, you pull up the phone to take
  your mind off of it. Before you realize it, it's hours later and
  you're feeling miserable after wasting your free time on Facebook
  again.

* A friend pulls you aside and says you did something rude or
  thoughtless. While at first you have no idea what he is talking
  about, part of you agrees on some level.

What is going on here? In all cases, one is made aware of some sort of
subtle personality defect through reflection or feedback. But it all
cases, these are actions that one as performed _without conscious
decision_, where one later _regrets the action made_ earlier, or at
least wonders if it was inappropriate or unkind. Perhaps what is
happening is a bad habit - a vice, in other words - and one wishes to
replace it with a virtuous behavior. In other cases, one has too
limited an awareness that one has failed to behave thoughtfully, and
later realizes his or mistake once circumstances have brought it to
his or her attention.

Now, suppose one wishes to change behavior? Realizing what the problem
is is only the first step. To change this behavior one must realize
there is a problem _as it is happening_ and then act differently than
one has done in the past.

This is much easier said than done.

If you review the "workout," such as it is, you'll see that most of it
is composed of _directed reflection_. Additionally, it is not all at
once. It is several short periods during the day - periods
specifically set aside for just such reflection. This makes even more
sense when you look at the purpose of prayer and meditation within the
context of the Baha'i Faith, from which it is drawn:

* prayer as seen as being in the presence of the Godhead
* meditation seen as looking within oneself to gain knowledge of the
true self

In this context, it seems the purpose of all these activities is to _reflect
more properly on our actions_. Self-awareness turns out to be very
important, then.

The root problem, when we wish to improve ourselves, is that most of
our action is automatic, habitual or instinctual. Duhigg's book
tells an amusing-sounding but serious case study of an older patient
who has suffered massive brain damage to his memory - enough to make
deliberation and learning practically impossible. One would think such
a person would be practically invalid based on the damage suffered.
Yet that was not the case - he was
able to carry out a full variety of activities, and continued in his
daily routine. When interrupted, he could get incredibly disoriented -
because he had no awareness of the actions he was carrying out! Yet if
allowed to proceed uninterrupted, he would continue with his daily
routine. All through the force of habitual, unconscious actions.

What is the point? The point here is that very few of our actions are
taken under full, rational deliberation. Like our wandering senior
above, we carry out a huge number of tasks with a
complete lack of conscious thought. We
know this from cognitive research - brain activity is seen even before
we are aware of making a decision. By the time we make a decision, it
is already made. And when asked about these decisions, we may give
plausible-sounding answers - but it is simply our brain coming up with
after-the-fact justifications for our actions. In reality, our brain
decided without us even knowing why.

So what do these activities achieve? How do they help? Well, let's
take meditation, mindfulness, because at least I know that's been
studied.


What about the others? These try to achieve very much the same
effect. They attempt to slow down thought and the automatic engagement
of habitual action, and force self-reflection on a regular basis. The
goal is bring enough self-awareness that we become aware of our
habits, good and bad. While such activities are insufficient to effect
positive changes, they are indeed necessary.

In that manner, we can work to change actions to make negative actions
less habitual. "Trying" to be a better person will not work, if your
actions through the day are automatic, the only "trying" one will do
is beating oneself up after-the-fact after realizing one has fallen
short in one way or another.

Indeed, if you can't do any of the activities mentioned, there is one
thing you can do - nothing! Have you ever done nothing - intentionally
done nothing - and just spaced out? It turns out that when this
happens, your brain isn't doing anything - it's actually going into
"default mode" (yes, your brain was discovered to have a default
mode). It turns out that in thinking of nothing, [your brain carries
out a wide varieties of
activities](https://www.themeditationblog.com/the-brains-default-mode-network-what-does-it-mean-to-us/). It
turns out that allowing your brain to wander in default mode has the
same effect as an active "mindfulness" workout. If you're looking for
a reason to stop looking at your smartphone when you're in line at the
store counter, this is it. And moreover, if simply _doing nothing_ is
beneficial, how much moreso it may be to introduce activities to
guarantee this sort of thought into your schedule.

So if you want to "be a better person," how should this work? How do
you place this in the core of your activities? It
depends upon what you're seeing:

* If you know what things you really need to work on - then this is
  pretty obvious. These are the actions you should meditate about.

* If you really don't know what to work on, but you just want to be
  "better," than you should particularly meditate on reviewing your
  own actions throughout the day. The end-of-day review could be
  particularly helpful.

If you practice the Baha'i Faith, it is taken on faith that these
activities will assist you, but if not - and even if you're not
religious - then at least in theory, it should assist in bringing
awareness to your problem and helping to keep it less habitual.

## A Caveat Regarding Social Pressure

There's one more case which requires consideration:

* You've been led to believe you're flawed based on feedback from one
  or more people, and you're struggling to understand it.

This case can be particularly challenging.

It is possible that you really do have flaws, and you don't realize
them. And sometimes this is the case. Let's look at the worst-case
example: people with sociopathic inclinations.

One would think that sociopaths are rare. They are uncommon, but
unfortunately, not all that rare. A few percentage of
all people struggle with this inclination. Perhaps one in 30 or one in 40 -
hardly a tiny number. You would think the world full of criminals
based on that! Surely this explains the prevelance of evil in the
world, no?

In fact, this isn't the case, and sociopathic tendencies don't
guarantee a one-way trip on a Fung Wah bus cruising the Highway to
Hell. Instead, most people with sociopathic inclinations turn out no
less successful or law-abiding than you or I. The may have had
troubled a troubled adolescence; peers may still say they have "rough
edges" or are a bit of a jerk, but in the main, their prescense is
still not a problem. How is it that people with such behavior can fit
in normally in society? The key that they have grown virtue, in spite
of their inclinations, based on social pressure and feedback. Think of
this from the point of view of an average-intelligence sociopath who
just wants to get along in the world. In the past, their behavior has
caused them problems. They didn't magically realize it on their own -
they got lots and lots of negative feedback, and found out that lying
and lashing out angrily are not acceptable in society. Over time they
realized their problem to solve. Most eventually learned
to curb their anger and bad instincts, and develop some sense of
empathy. In other words, their tendency may be a social handicap, but
nothing more.

So if you're getting negative feedback, it may be valid, even though
you don't see any problems. My point isn't that you're a psychopath -
but rather, such feedback may be extremely helpful to you. It's
possible you should listen to others. This is especially the case if
this is feedback from someone whose character you know to be good.

--------------------------

However, there is a danger of listening to others. Society is a useful
mirror on our actions, but sometimes we are dealing with a broken
mirror.

If someone believes you're flawed, it may be for reasons
havoing far more to do with themselves than yourself.
If you have to deal with someone who is truly toxic,
they may be able to make you feel guilty about anything that doesn't
serve their narrow interest. Peers may do the same if you fail to
conform to their own unwritten norms, norms that have nothing to do
with morality, or may even be against it.

Again, self-reflection is a key guide. And when self-reflecting, you
may need to tune out the voices of others in society. If
you believe you are being criticized for vices, that's one thing, and
this is a valuable signal. But if you are instead being criticized for
virtues, that is something far more sinister. Worst case, you may
find that you have a different problem - not a need for self
improvement, but a need to halt destructive criticism from someone else. You
may find that to gain proper perspective, you may need to distance
oneself from a toxic person or peer group.

This is one reason why your choice of friends are so important for
your development. Make sure the people you surround yourself with will
support your growth as a person. In your struggle for self-awareness,
surround yourself with people balanced enough to who see you as you
actually are.
