# Intermediate Exercises for Growing Virtue

I've written prior about a suggested daily "workout" to help in your
effort to become a better person. I've focused on this because this is
something "positive" you can do. Positive actions are actions you can
make habitual; you can't make a habit of not-doing something The focus
of the positive actions are to try to bring awareness to actions that
would otherwise be unconscious or habitual, enabling you to improve
those.

Likewise, if you want to work on anything as a New Year's resoltion,
it's good to "start off with a bang." By picking up a new daily
routine and committing to it, you will quickly build the momentum you
need to set on a path of self-improvement without overcommitting yourself.

The daily workout is drawn from the Baha'i Writings, but there are
many more things in the Baha'i Writings to cultivate virtue that are
not daily activities. These are less regular activities. Most of these
are obligations for Baha'is, but all of them have things to recommend
for anyone wanting to become a better person.

There is no system to this; so we'll cover these in no particular
order.

## The Fast

For many Baha'is, this has become, inadvertantly or not, the
touchstone of being a "real Baha'i." Once a year for 19 days (either
March 1-19 or March 2-20), all Baha'is undertake a fast. During that
time, there is no eating and drinking from sunrise until sunset. Like
many laws in the Baha'i Faith, no justification for this law is given;
while some writings allude to this period of self-discipline as having
positive benefits for one's personal growth, most do not.

As a religious institution, fasts are very common, though the form
varies. Some have theorized that the purpose is to ensure a community
remains tight-knit by excluding those who are unwilling to go through
such sacrifices. In a way, the sacrifice is so visible (to oneself)
that one feels as if he is not a "real Baha'i" if he is not practicing
the fast. I frequently catch colds during the fast, and when I do so,
I cannot participate in the fast. When this happens, I frequently feel
like I didn't "do the whole fast," in spite of the fact that the
writings forbid participation in the fast unless you are in health,
and that nobody really knows whether I'm practicing it or not. (Thanks
to our colder-than-average March, very few colds went through the
office, and I managed to make it all the way through.)

As a growth experience, a fast has an intuitive appeal. Much of
one's virtue requires self-restraint in a variety of forms;
particularly, through one's willpower or grit. Many psychologists have
studied this, and note that willpower is a bit like a muscle. A
taxing, stressful day tends to overuse one's willpower, which is why
that doughnut looks so good after a bad day at work. But conversely,
it can be exercised like a muscle, and over time it will grow. So it
makes sense that the fast could be seen as a sort of willpower growth
exercise. Were one to practice it too frequently, it would stress
one's willpower and deplete it for other things. But in intensity,
over a short stretch, it may serve for a small
permanent elevation.

As someone who has practiced it, I can say that _during_ the fact, it
does not help your willpower at all! While the disruption of your
schedule may be a good time to adopt some new habits, it is not the
time to pick up a habit that requires a lot of willpower. Keeping your
bad habits in check will be enough of a challeng. And anyone who is
hoping to use it to lose a significant amount of weight may also be
disappointed! But would I recommend it to someone in good health who
isn't Baha'i? Absolutely! Unfortunately, I cannot feel my willpower
"grow" once I've exited the fast, but if what we know about the
science of willpower is correct, it should.

## Review of Expenditures

The Baha'i rules on tithing are not like any I've heard about
elsewhere. In theory, it is steep levy - 19%. But it does not become
payable until a certain amount has been accumlated in savings, and is
only payable _after one has deducted any necessary expenditures_. What
is _necessary_? Well, there are some guidelines - food, shelter,
necessary furnishings for the home, and expenses necessary for the
maintenance of one's profession are mentioned. But it essentially
boils down to "whatever you determine is a necessary expense." In
practice, this means someone may honestly pay ten percent or five
percent, and is possibly nothing (e.g. "not payable) for many people.

Of course, for someone who isn't a Baha'i, they won't be doing
this. So why even bring this up?

Because this inculcates another habit. It forces the habit of reviewing
one's habitual expenditures. This review is felt as being so important
that Baha'is have been told that setting up automatic bill-payments
for tithing is not possible. When someone becomes a Baha'i and gets
serious about applying this law, one quickly learns that the fastest
way to deplete one's savings is to rack up a lot of unnecessary
expenses, not account for them properly, and find you haven't properly
accounted for tithing. As a result, one quickly gets into the habit of
thinking where their money is going every month.

How does this help you cultivate virtues? Obviously, this is going to
directly assist with virtues such as prudence and thrift. But it is
also more far-reaching, in that one has to give thought to how one
spends one resources, and time. Some expenditures, quite bluntly, are
harmful. Without a review of one's expenses, it is far to easy to put
it on the card and forget about it.

## Study of "The Useful Arts"

Baha'is are urged to study "the useful arts." In the context of this
quote, it means anything that is beneficial to yourself or
mankind. The goal, therefore, is to spend time in education and
self-improvement.

In the context of "the useful arts," something specific was meant. In
the Persian culture in which the Baha'i Faith was founded, there were
a number of religiously-oriented pseudosciences that were posed as
serious issues of study; for example, studies of "the heavenly
spheres." The founders of the Faith wanted to exclude such fields from
consideration, broadly lumping such fields as a mass of studies
"beginning with words and ending with words"; the equivalent of
arguments of how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. Aside of
that, virtually any course of study is recommended.

You can imagine what this really means. Studying for your profession
is useful. So is studying a useful field just out of
curiousity. Sudying the liberal arts and philosophies for one's own
edification and love of wisdom is useful. Hopefully, reading this blog counts. 

Spending hours on wikipedia seeing what the _Game of Thrones_ actors
are doing in their off hours? Probably not.

So it is more or less a given that part of being a virtuous person is
being well read and exposing yourself to a lot of ideas. If one is not
a "reader" there is no harm in that inclination; the problem is when
one fails to educate oneself to the point of folly.

## "Teaching"

Note the quotes. Within the context of the Baha'i Faith, it means
something very particular, and is frequently misunderstood. This is a
problem even with (and perhaps especially with) Baha'is and other
religious followers.

Here is the point underlying teaching: if you have a practice that you
yourself find helpful, you have an implicit obligation to share this
with others as soon as one is adept.  "Teaching" is just that -
sharing this knowledge with others who are interested, in a helpful
way. This requires doing a number of things:

* Know your technique or field of study well enough that you can be
  confident of your knowledge and can turthfully explain to others.

* An ability to relate this to others so they find it agreeable and
 can adapt it for their needs.

* A view toward teaching as a process of assisting others in their
 spiritual growth, in which you help others find the path so that they
 can learn independently as soon as possible.

* Enough wisdom to know who is eager for such knowledge and who you
  are bothering.

Unfortunately for the Baha'i Faith, in the Christian millieu of
America, teaching is too easy to recast as evangelism under another
name. It is not, and it is not to be confused with
salesmanship. Certainly, the ability to teach others requires
developing a number of virtues. This is far removed from evangelism,
which all too often relies on loudly proclaiming a one-size-fits-all
messages to everyone, willing or not, and then regarding ones duty as
done the second the message is loudly ejected from one's mouth.

This blog is something I regard as teaching. I've benefitted from
these practices, ergo, I am sharing this with others. You are reading
it, so obviously you are interested; those who are disinterested are
not forced to read. I make some effots to ensure this is read, but
will not evangelize for it.



Teaching is not to be confused with evangelism. Teaching is, um,
teaching, and if you find these practices good, it is only natural you
would tell others who may benefit.

## Personal Growth through Life Stages

I've discussed practices on a day-by-day basis. Now I'd like to take
on something else - virtue growth throughout your entire life.

On a larger scale - the scale of your entire lifetime - it is
necessary to thing of personal growth as growing through stages. As we
meet challenges, we will (hopefully) face these challenges and grow as
people.

There are three life changes that are particularly important in the
life of an individual:

1. The First "Real Job"

2. Marriage

3. Children

It is notable that the Baha'i Faith has much to say about each of
these. In particular, all of these are seen as _normative_ for an
individual. That is, some sort of profession is _required_ for
Baha'is. Marriage is _recommended_ (but not obligatory). Once married,
having children is _recommended_, though not required; meanwhile,
adoptions are seen as particularly salutary.

One thing that has induced much worry about the so-called millenials
is delay and foot-draging of young adults as they put off these life
stages. I'm not too eager to draw generalizations about entire
generations of youth; if you think the problem is lack of character
clutivation - whose fault is that? My personal tendency is to think
most millenials get a raw deal from scociety. I
personally was quite lucky in being able to get a college education
and being inclined toward a profession that pays well. I certainly
wouldn't what to be in the position of a hard-working twentysomething
male who wasn't academically inclined and who has trouble finding work
in a chosen trade that pays well; even if you have a job, people
without a degree can increasingly find contracting marriage difficult
through no fault of their own.

But that is an aside. One can give millenials every benefit of the
doubt, while still believing that there is much to be said for working
through these life stages, and recommending that these be taken
seriously without postponing it for some ideal future state. While
some delay in taking on all of these responsibilities may be prudent,
meeting them seems far more salutary than regarding these as
"capstones" of an ideal life, whereby

* the first "real" job is only considered valid in your targeted
profession, and

* marriage is not to be attempted until one is
professionally established, and 

* childbearing is not attempted until both parents are at a suitable
point in their profession and their material means.

This sort of attitude may be healthier than the attitude of earlier
working-class generations, whereby less-mature adults were pushed hit
this "trifecta" by the age of 25, ready or not. Still, the present
situation, whereby entire sections of society are considered
"unmarriageable" and childbearing is postponed until a health
pregnancy becomes difficult to effect quite little to
recommend to it.

---------------

The final life stage is preparing for death, and here again, the
Baha'i Faith recommends meeting this instead of postponing it. In
particular, everyone is required to have a will. While Baha'i law has
a (rather complicated) will for intestancy, Baha'is are required to
dedicate their own will, ensuring that this is only applied in unusual
circumstances.
