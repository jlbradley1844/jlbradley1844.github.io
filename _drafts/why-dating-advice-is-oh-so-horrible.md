It is a truism that one should be wary of unsolicited advice.

This goes doubly so for dating, courtship, and "pairing
off"... perhaps the only group, aside from finance, where you find
loads of people giving out free advice.

I don't read many blogs by individuals. I tend to read
"magazine-style" blogs which are aggregators (and the fact that I make
this choice, and others probably do to,
casts considerable doubt on my judgement to write a personal blog. But
I digress...) One individual blog I do read is [Nassim Nicholas Taleb's
_Incertio_](https://medium.com/incerto). NNT is of course the writer
of _Fooled by Randomness_, a book beloved within finance, though detested
by the wealthy traders it unmasked, as well as an influential
instructor in the field of mathematical finance. Though I didn't like
his last book (_Antifragile_) much, I suspect _Incerto_ will be a doozy. One key point
of this book so far is the fact that most advice given out is wrong
for a variety of agency reasons.

It's certainly worth a read, and it explains why finance is such a morally
fraught field. In most fields, if you get good advice, you will
generate return business. But in finance, if you give good advice,
people will turn away because they don't like the answers you give
them (hint: 90% of good advice in finance, as of this writing,
currently boils down to the two words "index fund"). Or if you are a
trader managing inventory, it's worse - you won't be doing your
job. Meanwhile if you give bad advice, you can bilk someone out of
millions, and once you squeeze that much money out of someone, who
cares if they don't come back?

Dating is just as bad. I say that as someone who married what I
consider to be late in life despite my best intentions. I took a lot
of advice, and learned the hard way most of it was bad - even selfish
in some cases. Yet the inherent self-dealing isn't as
self-evident as in finance. Why would that be the case?

Part of this is to vent, but part of this is to warn others not to
make the same mistakes I did.
If you're still reading this, you are probably not yet married, and
even that in particular is not a goal, not that happy with how things
are going. I can't tell you what to do, but I can tell you what to be
cautious of. It is also, more broadly, why you should mistrust _any_
unsolicited advice.

There are people for whom romance comes easily - this column is not
for them. In general, romance is a tough problem for those not born
naturally desireable. Such recipients are often the target of
unwarranted advice, particularly if said recipients are attractive
enough for someone but not everyone. Unsolicited advice is frequently
given for selfish reason and says more about the person offering the
advice than anything else:
* A well-meaning friend may goad you into taking risks you wouldn't
ordinarily take because he's tired of listening to you complain;
* An attractive platonic friend may tell you to "just let things
happen" because she's had to deal with guys she barely knows hitting
her up for dates, and she doesn't want to see you get in that habit;
* Someone tries to make you feel guilty about not dating a mutual
friend whom she happens to be close to;
* Your friend of the opposite sex professes no romatic interest
in you, yet can't stop trashing anyone you profess interest in, and
would just prefer you stop "looking so hard."
* A buddy of yours, who has never had any trouble in this area, tells you your problems with the local dating scene
are all in your head - particularly when you make noises about
relocating.
* Your pastor indicates the problem is with young kids nowadays all
being about looks, and instead suggests you get involved in church
activities, in spite of the fact the singles involved are either
very unattractive or aged widows.

This sort of stuff happens _all the time_. What about people who you
pay to give advice? This generally means two things - self-help books
and psychologists.

Of the self-help books, the less said about them the better. There are
some who give some solid advice, but none of them really express ideas
that require a full-length book - in many cases, Amazon reviews give
you an adequate synopsis. Unfortunately, the people who write the
book-jacket blurbs are well aware of this, which is why they put such
a hard sell on how much the book will help - and why you need to buy
the book to fully benefit.

As far as psychologists: unfortunately, here I speak from
experience. If you are having problems in this area - you should
seriously consider using one for a while, if you have the means. Some
of them are good, but you have to be picky. And unfortunately, you have
to be realistic about it. I'll discuss it later, but the main thing
you have to remember is that all they can do is work with you _if you
have something to work with_. That is, they can help if you already
are dating or at least have opportunities to ask out or be asked out
on dates. If you are in a "dating desert," they cannot help. Worse
yet, they may not realize they cannot help, and may in fact suspect
you are "resisting treatment."


--------

There is a difference between unsolicited advice and *authority*. I'm
quite sure lots of people will read this and think "Oh, this isn't a
problem for me, I always think for myself!" I'm about to debunk my own
argument a little.

When an authority speaks on something, you may wish to listen. But why
you will listen to is based on what basis said authority was granted.

There is a lot of advice of a pseudoscientific nature. As you may have
figured, science doesn't have a heck of a lot of help here. I'm
talking about *hard science*, not the sort of stuff from
self-styled psychologists with "degrees in the school of 'hard
knocks'"; those are the people who write the self-help books that
promise to magically fix your love life that I'm trying to warn you about.

That doesn't keep some charlatains from trying - successfully. There
are some _theories_ which seem to be somewhat backed up by science,
but these are not the same. The bulk of this is aimed at women -
self-help books on dating are mostly geared towards young, eager
women. Women are much more inclined to read and much more inclined to
work on themselves and pay attention to relationships; hence, much
more inclined to buy books. Most of the books themselves are fluff - a
quick look at the footnotes and endnotes of the book (if they even
exist) and author interview will quickly conform that. When they are
helpful, they tend to help the people who never really needed help -
as I discuss below.

However, this happens to men, too. A lot of guys put far to much stock in
a pseudoscience called "Evolutionariy Psychology"; I was one of them for about
a year or two, until I figured out that much of this was not science,
but simply scientific-sounding self-help pitched at desparate single men
eager to change their luck. It started in the nineties, and continues
on with consultants, who are usually just glorified social workers,
pitching these beliefs for over a hundred dollars a session in
dating deserts for men like Austin, Seattle and San
Jose - places packed to the gills with awkward men too rattled by
multi-year dry spells in dating to realize that many of their problems
could be fixed with a UHaul and a
one-way ticket to someplace, _anyplace_, other than the high-tech
cities where well-paid men of all sorts vastly outnumber the young educated
women they would normally couple with.

As bad as this is, this is far better than the coated-with-sleaze
scene of the "Pick up Artist." This has been written about everywhere;
I'm not sure whether the goal is to assist men with their dating lives
or lash out by making single women miserable. In any case, it seems to
have some marginal improvement on the former while making far more of
a contribution toward the latter cause. Here again, horrible advice,
given from someone who doesn't have your best interest in heart. At
the modest cost of making the world a little worse each day.

The fact remains, people may say they are not looking for authority,
but that is exactly what people start looking for when they are very
frustrated with what is really a very basic need.

--------------------------------

So most advice is bad. But some is good. But it is misapplied. Why is
that? And how do you avoid it?

Let's divide the world of singles, roughly speaking, into three
groups. The group you are in will roughly determine how successful you
are. It also determines the kind of advice you should listen to.

This is why even good advice can be ineffective for you. It is very
likely you are taking advice meant for someone in a different
situation dealing with a very different sort of problem.

Bluntly:

ALPHAS: you are attractive to potential mates. Many would be
interested in you

BETAS: you are not unattractive. Many would not be interested in
dating you, but some are.

GAMMAS: you have issues, physical or psychological, that keep you from
being seen as attractive.

I am excluding those who are so universally attractive they can can
practically compel romatic interest from others of the opposite
sex. We are talking about normal people here.

Most of the advice written for women is written for "alpha" women,
unfortunately. The bulk of your alphas are educated enough to buy
books and have enough options that when they listen to advice, it
actually does them some good. As a psychologiest, working with them is
rewarding - just teach them to recognize dorks and avoid them. The key
is to realize most wome, while they know they are attractive, also
realize they are not attractive to _everyone_, meaning, potentially,
not being able to extract the interest of the men they wish to be
dating.

Alphas don't have problems, but the problems they have are not wicked
hard. They are the "first world problems" of dating. Generally
speaking, they are operating in a one-way marketplace. They receive
lots of interest, but are only interested in some of the selections,
and many of the ones the really want are unattainable. They also may
one ones that appear to be what they want but they are not. These are
problems of a buyer's marketplace; you may not be able to get what you
want at a price you want, but you will eventually be able to get
it. And so it is with most of the alpha women buying the self-help
books. They may wring their hands about numbering men with bachelor's
degrees in NYC by almost 1.4 to 1. But they will be able to survive,
perhaps by dating older men, or dating those without a degree but with
an established career, or a number of alternatives. To this extent it
is a _culling_ problem - being able to _recognize_ and pursue the best
options for you.

So if you pick up a self-help book aimed at women, you are going to
find a lot of advice that basically boils down to "culling."
Essentially, stop automatically picking the best looking guy, and go
with some more meaningful things. Eventually, this will sink in
courtesy of a book. More likely, it would have just as quickly sunk in
through some other means; the mere fact that a problem was solved by a
$11 investment in a trade paperback where the writer was much more
concerned with readability than scientific rigor means the problem itself wasn't
that hard to begin with.

If you are a beta, you are going to find a lot of this frustrating. A
beta is in a "two way marketplace." A two way marketplace is much more
difficult. Here's why: because you are not compelling to most people,
you will need to expose yourself to a lot of other people, who will
have interest in you. Worse yet, of those who do have interest, most
will probably be betas. Odds are, you will not find them
attractive. Is some of the advice, which is mostly about culling,
useful? Yes, absolutely. Is it the most serious problem you need to
concentrate on? I wouldn't count on it!

So one problem is that women get advice which basically on one hand,
implies that it is _normal_ to be surrounded by suitors (which is
definitely not the case), and once the dust settles, how to recognize
and choose Mister Big. The sense of inadequacy and helplessness
cultivated is not accidental, when it comes to the magazines printing
much of this self-help. It's main business is to sell cosmetics and
fashion, which is why they keep printing this stuff. Also, these
columns tend to be "evergreen" materials; i.e. is rarely original, but
lightly edited from a column printed several years ago. Self-help
books should be of a different nature, but many times are done to
bolster the author's core business, which is usually dispensing dating
advice and workshops; again, it doesn't have to be effective, just
tantalizing enough that people keep coming back.

The problem with men? Their problem is men really want an answer to
the question: "How do I get with HER?" Or, "How do I get a lot of
BEAUTIFUL women?" In short? Most promise a way for beta men to woo and
date alpha women. In general, men don't buy self-help books, but if
you find a desparate mark, you can bilk a guy out of a lot of
money. And so, much of the advice is centered on techniques for dating
women far out of their league. This is ready-made for charlatans -
give a bunch of advice they have heard from their alpha collegues (who
have no trouble inducing interest themselves), and when their marks
report lack of success, you tell them "You're doing it all wrong," or
"You need to project confidence!" and keep pushing them in that
direction. After all, you don't need to succeed; you just need to
convince them that their success depends on continually forking over
the dough.

People disadvantage themselves - and beat themselves up - because they
don't really know what is going on. Their thought is that their lack
of success is abnormal or atypical. In fact, the truth is a little
despressing, were it to be known. The difference in lives between
someone who is very attractive and someone who is merely pleasant is
enormous - much more so than you would imagine. If you're a guy on a
dating site, it's
the difference between having half of your messages responded to and
many of them resulting in in-person meetings, and having one or two
percent responded to, with a chance one of them might result in an
in-person meeting. And this is for someone who is _merely_ acceptable,
not ugly or unsuccessful. A lot of these statistics are laid out in
_Dataclysm_ (author...). It's similar to the distribution of wealth in
the US. If you don't know that, and think that to "succeed" you have
to replicate that level of success, you're setting yourself up for
horrible failure.

And for the most part,
"moving up" is not an option. If you're heavyset, you can probably
drop a few pounds and keep it off through good eating habits (I refuse
to use the word d _ _ t) and regular exercise - which you ought to be
doing anyway. This will make you more attractive. It will not make you
Jennifer Lawrence. If you're a 5'6" male, you can wear shoe
lifts.... annnnnnd that's about it. You generally can do and should
present yourself as well as you can - it will not only help your self
confidence but make the world a little more pleasant. But it will not
suddenly turn around your romantic life.
