It is a truism that one should be wary of unsolicited advice.

This goes doubly so for dating, courtship, and "pairing
off"... perhaps the only area, aside from finance, where you find
loads of people giving out free advice - strangers, relatives, friends...
_anyone_.

I don't read many blogs by individuals. I tend to read
"magazine-style" blogs which are aggregators (and the fact that I make
this choice, and others probably do to, casts considerable doubt on my
judgement to write a personal blog. But I digress...) One individual
blog I do read is [Nassim Nicholas Taleb's
_Incertio_](https://medium.com/incerto). NNT is of course the writer
of _Fooled by Randomness_, a book beloved within finance, though
detested by the wealthy traders it unmasked, as well as an influential
instructor in the field of mathematical finance. Though I didn't like
his last book (_Antifragile_) much, I suspect his next one, _Incerto_,
will be a doozy. His blog is mostly drafts that will go into that book.
I can't say I agree with all of it, but at
least he gives it some thought from a dispassionate perspective. A

One key point of _Incerto_ is the fact that
most advice given out is wrong - badly wrong. This is for a variety of
agency reasons. Saying someone is giving out bad advice for "agency reasons" is business-speak for "the advice is being given is given to improve _the_ _recommender's_ life; it_might_ improve yours.

A quick read will quickly illustrate why finance is such a morally
fraught field. In most fields, if you get good advice, you will
generate return business - or, if you'll pardon more "business-speak,"
your incentives align with your customers. Good advice begets good
business. But in finance, you may make more money by giving bad advice
than by good advice. Worse yet, if you do give solid, unbiased advice,
you may not get repeat business, as people may like the answers you
give them ("I pay you for advice and you tell me to just by an index
fund??")  Meanwhile, if you work for a firm, you may have business
incentives are purposely aligned against your own customer, which is
why so many firms are pushing back hard on the fiduciary standard - it
goes against their business model. Lots of people make money unloading
unattractive investments on suckers, something you can't do if you're
legally forced to give good advice.

You'd think dispassionate advice in dating would be much easier to
come by. Why wouldn't your friends and relatives offering advice want you to be
successful and happy? Why would the authors of advice columns and
self-help books dole out ineffective or harmful advice, rather than
helpful things which, we presume, would lead to repeat business and
word-of-mouth? Unfortunately, even though intentions may be pure in
some cases, the effect is nearly as bad. 

I say that as someone who married in my late thirties - I consider
that a late marriage - in spite of my best intentions. I took a lot of
advice, and learned the hard way most of it was bad - even selfish in
some cases. Yet there wouldn't seem to be any incentive for doling out
bad advice. Why would bad advice be so common? Well, I learned a bit
about things, and I think by now I can at least give my own
unsolicited advice, to save others from unhappiness.
 I can't tell you what to do, but I can tell you what
to be cautious of. It is also, more broadly, why you should mistrust
_any_ unsolicited advice. But will also tell you what sort of advice
you can trust.

At this point you may think "hey, *you* might be giving out bad advice
for selfish reasons!" Good, you're off to a great start. Partly I'm
writing about this to vent after years of perspective, but mainly to
warn others not to make the same unwise, stupid mistakes I
did. Without the bad advice, I would've still made lots of stupid
mistakes that made me unhappy, but not just quite so many. 

-------------------------------------

So, to begin:

If you're still
reading this, you are probably not yet married, and even if that is
not your goal, you may still be unhappy with how
things are going.
There are people for whom romance comes easily - this column is not
for them. 

Romance is a tough problem for those not born
naturally desireable. This leads people to seeking or become the
recipients of advice; often, a sense of subtle desperation leads
people to act on advice they would otherwise suspect is unwise.
While usually those offering advice
may believe they are recommending the best, in many cases, they are
often unconsciously, unwittingly serve their own agendas. This doesn't
necessarily mean the advice is bad, but it may say more about the
desires and fears of the person offering the advice than about the
true situation. I could catalogue some of the bad advice I was given,
along with why I suspect why I got it. I don't think an exhaustive
list will help, but I do feel compelled to give those that caused me
true harm, along with the reason I probably got it:

* A well-meaning friend continually goaded me into taking risks in my
relationships - basically, coaching me to be rude. He was probably just
 tired of hearing me complain and wanted to shake things up.

* A friend of mine, who has never had any trouble in this area, told
me my problems with the local dating scene were all due to a "bad attitude."
He knew I was looking to move. (And moving did help, a whole lot.)

* An attractive platonic woman friend told me I needed to
"just let things happen" and stop being pushy. "Wome are attracted to
that; don't come on strong, it will just happen on its own." Her life
was full of members of the opposite sex and people hitting on her, and
she wanted men, and me by extension, to change how we did things.

* A psychologist pushed me to start sleeping around casually with
  people you are not attracted to. He was convinced causal sex would
  be good for me. You can guess what his motivation might be.

This sort of stuff happens _all the time_.

Then there are the people you pay to give you advice; generally
self-help books and advice columns, and psychologists.

Of advice columns, the less said about them the better. For self-help
books, some of them will give
solid advice, but none of them really express ideas
that require a full-length book - in many cases, Amazon reviews give
you an adequate synopsis. Unfortunately, the people who write the
book-jacket blurbs are well aware of this, which is why they put such
a hard sell on how much the book will help, but only if you read and
apply THE WHOLE BOOK will you get full benefit.

As far as psychologists: unfortunately, here I speak from
experience. If you are having problems in this area, you should
seriously consider using one for a while, if you have the
means. However, you have to be picky; you may need to go through two
or three. The best ones will be up front about the fact that this can
be a difficult problem for even those with the best personalities.
The main problem they yave is that they can work with you only _if_
you have romantic potential on some level. That is, you need to be
basically attractive and have opportunities to ask out or be asked out
on dates. If you are in a "dating desert," they cannot help. Worse
yet, they may not realize they cannot help, and may in fact suspect
you are "resisting treatment."

One would think *science* would be of help, right? Unfortunately,
science in this area is still basically descriptive (what things are),
not prescriptive (what to do). Prescriptive advice is mostly
pseudoscientific nature. I'm
talking about *hard science*, not the sort of stuff from
self-styled psychologists with "degrees in the school of 'hard
knocks'"; those are the people who write the self-help books that
promise to magically fix your love life that I'm trying to warn you about.
That doesn't keep some charlatains from trying - successfully - to
present their findings as rigorous and repeatable. 

There
are some _theories_ which seem to be somewhat backed up by science,
but these are not the same. The bulk of this is aimed at women -
self-help books on dating are mostly geared towards young, eager
women. Women are much more inclined to read and much more inclined to
work on themselves and pay attention to relationships; hence, much
more inclined to buy books. Most of the books themselves are fluff - a
quick look at the footnotes and endnotes of the book (if they even
exist) and author interview will quickly conform that. When they are
helpful, they tend to help the people who never really needed help -
as I discuss below.

However, this happens to men, too. A lot of guys put far to much stock in
a pseudoscience called "Evolutionariy Psychology"; I was one of them for about
a year or two, until I figured out that much of this was not science,
but simply scientific-sounding self-help pitched at desparate single men
eager to change their luck. It started in the nineties, and continues
on with consultants, who are usually just glorified social workers,
pitching these beliefs for over a hundred dollars a session in
dating deserts for men like Austin, Seattle and San
Jose - places packed to the gills with awkward men too rattled by
multi-year dry spells in dating to realize that many of their problems
could be fixed with a UHaul and a
one-way ticket to someplace, _anyplace_, other than the high-tech
cities where well-paid men of all sorts vastly outnumber the young educated
women they would normally couple with.

As bad as this is, this is far better than the coated-with-sleaze
scene of the "Pick up Artist." This has been written about everywhere;
I'm not sure whether the goal is to assist men with their dating lives
or lash out by making single women miserable. In any case, it seems to
have some marginal improvement on the former while making far more of
a contribution toward the latter cause. Here again, horrible advice,
given from someone who doesn't have your best interest in heart. At
the modest cost of making the world a little worse each day.

The fact remains, people may say they are not looking for authority,
but that is exactly what people start looking for when they are very
frustrated with what is really a very basic need.

--------------------------------

So most advice is bad. 
But some is good. 
But it might not be good for you - it can be misapplied. 

Why is that? And how do you avoid it?

Let's divide the world of singles, roughly speaking, into three
groups. The group you are in will roughly determine how successful you
are. It also determines the kind of advice you should listen to.

This is why even good advice can be ineffective for you. It is very
likely you are taking advice meant for someone in a different
situation dealing with a very different sort of problem.

Bluntly, there are three sorts of people who need advice:

ALPHAS: you are attractive to potential mates. Many would be
interested in you

BETAS: you are not unattractive. Many would not be interested in
dating you, but some are.

GAMMAS: you have issues, physical or psychological, that keep you from
being seen as attractive.

I am excluding those who are so universally attractive they can can
practically compel romatic interest from others of the opposite
sex. We are talking about actual people here.

I don't think there's much of a point belaboring questions of "what's
the breakdown" and "which one am I." You probably know which one you
are, though my guess is there are plenty of "alpha" women who don't
know they are alphas. Hint: if you get lots of interest but you aren't
interested back, you are still an alpha.

Most of the advice written in self-help books is for the "alpha"
women. That is because there are a lot of book readers that fall into
this category, and they have enough romantic options that when the
listen to advice, it can actually do them some good. As a
psychologies, probably your easiest "win" is an attractive woman with
romantic problems, because the problem is almost certainly
psychological in nature.

This advice generally solves what I would consider to be dating's
version of "first world problems." Alphas are operating in what you
can think of as a one-way marketplace. This is a scenario that is
really easy to model and solve for. As an alpha, you receive a decent
amount of romantic interest, are only interested in some of the
selections, and many of the ones the really want are
unattainable. They also may one ones that appear to be what they want
but they are not. Think of it like buying a car. These are problems of
a buyer's marketplace; you may not be able to get what you want at a
price you want, but you will eventually be able to get it. And so it
is with most of the alphas buying the self-help books. They may wring
their hands about outnumbering men with bachelor's degrees in NYC by
almost 1.4 to 1. But they will be able to survive, perhaps by dating
older men, or dating those without a degree but with an established
career, or a number of alternatives. To this extent it is a _culling_
problem - being able to _recognize_ and pursue the best options for
you. You might not get the exact one you want, but given time and the
right search strategy, you will get one you are very happy with.

So if you pick up a self-help book aimed at women, you are going to
find a lot of advice that basically boils down to "culling."
Essentially, stop automatically picking the best looking guy, and go
with some more meaningful things. Eventually, this will sink in
courtesy of a book. More likely, it would have just as quickly sunk in
through some other means; the mere fact that a problem was solved by a
$11 investment in a trade paperback where the writer was much more
concerned with readability than scientific rigor means the problem
itself wasn't that hard to begin with.

If you are a beta, you are going to find a lot of this frustrating. A
beta is in a "two way marketplace." A two way marketplace is much more
difficult. If dating for alphas is like buying a car, dating for betas
is like interviewing for jobs. Here's why: because you are not
compelling to most people, you will need to expose yourself to a lot
of other people, so that you can find some ho might have interest in
you. Worse yet, of those who do have interest, most will probably be
betas. Odds are, you will not find them attractive. This means that
the number of people you need to come in contact with may need to be
an order of magnitude larger than the alphas to succeed. Is some of
the advice, which is mostly about culling, useful? Yes, absolutely. Is
it the most serious problem you need to concentrate on? I wouldn't
count on it!

Worse yet, the impression one gets, from hearing and reading all this
advice, is that it is _normal_ to be surrounded by suitors, either
asked out regularly or having women flirt with you all the time and
your most messages returned on your dating sight. *That is not at all
the situation for most normal people*. The sense of inadequacy and
helplessness that this leads to is often a happy accident,
particularly with respect to advice columns in magazines. Their main
business is to sell cosmetics and fashion, not to help you. Self-help
books should be of a different nature, but here again, there may be a
similar effect at play; many times are done to bolster the author's
core business, which is usually dispensing dating advice and
workshops; again, it doesn't have to be effective, just tantalizing
enough that people keep coming back.

If this stuff makes women insecure, it explicitly aims to make men
feel like outright failures. The problem with men? Their problem is
men really want an answer to the question: "How do I get with HER?"
Or, "How do I get a lot of BEAUTIFUL women?" In short, many men don't
just want to have a normal social life - they want "ring the bell."
Not just be happy, but be successfu. And the ordinary suspects show
up, promising a way for beta men to woo and date alpha women. In
general, men don't buy self-help books, but if you find a desparate
mark, you can bilk a guy out of a lot of money. And so, much of the
advice is centered on techniques for men trying to  date women far out of their
league. This is ready-made for charlatans - give a bunch of advice
they have heard from their alpha collegues (who have no trouble
inducing interest themselves), and when their marks report lack of
success, you tell them "You're doing it all wrong," or "You need to
project confidence!"  and keep pushing them in that direction. After
all, you don't need to succeed; you just need to convince them that
their success depends on continually forking over the dough, and make
sure their marks know that if they fail, it's *their* fault.

People disadvantage themselves badly and beat themselves up because they
don't really know the reality of the "average" situation. 
Their thought is that their lack
of success is abnormal or atypical. In fact, the truth is a little
despressing, were it to be known. The difference in lives between
someone who is very attractive and someone who is merely pleasant is
enormous - much more so than you would imagine. If you're a guy on a
dating site, it's the difference between having half of your messages
responded to and many of them resulting in in-person meetings, and
having one or two percent responded to, with a chance one of them
might result in an in-person meeting. In other words, an average
person is unsuccessfu. This is not about someone who is ugly or
deformed. A lot of these
statistics are laid out in _Dataclysm_ (author...). It's similar to
the distribution of wealth in the US. If you don't know that, and
think that to "succeed" you have to replicate that level of success,
you're setting yourself up for horrible failure.

When people don't realize this, and don't realize you can be happy
without a ridiculous amount of success, people frequently get
determined to "move up." For the most part, "moving up" is not an
option. If you're heavyset, you can probably drop a few pounds and
keep it off through good eating habits (I refuse to use the word d _ _
t) and regular exercise - which you ought to be doing anyway. This
will make you more attractive. It will not make you Jennifer
Lawrence. If you're a 5'6" male, you can wear shoe lifts.... annnnnnd
that's about it. And if you're a woman who suddenly finds herself
single at 39, you can't age backwards.  You generally can do and
should present yourself as well as you can - it will not only help
your self confidence but make the world a little more pleasant. But it
will not suddenly turn around your romantic life.

So if you're average, you need to take advice intended for the average
person. Not advice written for new college graduates whose main problem
is screening out strangers, or people whose main problem is
psychological in nature.

Fortunately, this is one case where math is your friend. You don't
need advice when you have math. And the math says you need NUMBERS. If
you are an alpha who is damaged, you need a shrink, and that's about
it. But if you are a beta, you need to meet a lot of people.

This may
mean *gasp* _*moving*_. But if it's serious enough, you'll do
it. Personally I love New York city, but I didn't move here just
because it was fun. No, I had spent five long years in a high-tech
"company town" and another three in Austin, all in my precious
twenties, and did whatever I could to improve my horrible love life. I
took a job in Houston - mainly out of convenience - only to find out I
was suddenly able to find dates once I moved without any problems at
all! For all the effort I spent all those years, a company move I took without
any thought cured my problems. This means that if you're a cute single
woman in New York that isn't meeting anyone, it means you may need to
*gulp* move to San Fransico, Boston or somewhere else where the men
are outnumbering you. Likewise, if you're a guy living in Silocon
Valley, _*run away*_. You don't need many millions from your startup
to attract someone, you just need to move somewhere where you have
someone to attract.

So while the problem with alphas is generally between the ears, the
problem with betas is just math, and how to improve it. Oh, you can
and should try to improve your looks, get better at socializing, all
that stuff. But you are not going to accomplish a complete makeover
except through the course of years of self improvement. In the
meantime, your happiness can't sit on the back burner.

Now if truly no one is interested in you, and you think you know why,
you may be a gamma - someone who is going to find it very difficult to
marry. In your case, you have two challenges. First is to find out
what the problem is. It may not be what you think. If you're morbidly
obese that may be it, but if you're simply overweight, that probably
isn't it - there are people around who will look past that. It is
generally due to poor physical presentation combined with other
barriers that must be recognized and treated.

A word about myself and how I relate to this. I would personally
consider myself a beta - a decent enough looking guy who got married
late in life, but being shorter than average and introverted, I had my
work cut out for me. However, for years I operated as a gamma, having
only one date before I turned 26. The combination was a problem of
social skills, poor physical presentation, clinical depression, and a
peer group that was overwhelmingly male, and I had to combat every one
of those just to have a _chance_. That is the tough thing about being a gamma - if you fix the
one obvious thing that is holding you back (in my case, the
depressive personality and poor physique), you may find there are
other serious issues. I didn't have what I'd consider a "normal"
dating life until I hit 30, and even past then, regular girlfriends
were few and far between. But, it did get better. The only time it was
bad was when I made the mistake of comparing my lack of success
against friends I had who did much better without needing to do nearly
any of the work I found necessary. Sometimes the worst thing you can
do for your own happiness is compare yourself to others.
