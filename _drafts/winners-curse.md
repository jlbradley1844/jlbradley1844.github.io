# The Winner's Curse and Christianity

The following post is from some thoughts I've been tossing about for years.
As a Baha'i, I'm concerned about the general lack of
interest in religion. By that, I don't necessarily mean lack of
interest in theology. I am more referring to the fact that people
generally don't find religious practices themselves - attendance at
church and associated activites - valuable to their lives. The area I
live in is a part of the country that is notably secular, so my
perceptions may appear to be a bit skewed. But given the way the
younger generations are moving away from religion, I suspect this will
be of broader concern over time.

The question, really, is what people think religion does for
them, an why it seems irrelevant to so many. Perhaps it's the fact that
most people profess little interest in theology or
philosophy. Many practice a form of belief I've heard called
aganotology - one who doesn't care if there is a God or not. While
some of this disinterest can be chalked up to "secularism," I think this is much
as it always is. I doubt very much that when church membership was
stronger, that there was much emphasis on actual hard issues of belief
or theology. Had there been, the pulpits would have thundered with
discussions of Augustine and Aquainas, and the discussions in the
twentieth century would have added such names as Tillich and Kung and
recent idealists like Bradley and Royce thrown into the mix. I'm quite sure the
only Christian churches that fit that description were the oddball
churches on college campuses catering to weirdos like me, who were in
bed by midnight on a Saturday night and had nothing else to do on a
Sunday morning.

I think the answer lies in other reasons people had for participating
in church or religious activities.  The most
trivial-sounding but important reason is simply simply convention and
a sense of belonging; you did it because your parents did it, and you
wanted your kids to do it to. From that point of view, this may not
necessarily be all that bad; the church became a form of social
capital. It helped to make groups of people in the same neighborhood
in a community, people who might not ordinarily come together.

Another reason is ethical and self-help. For most part, religion practice
rarely concerns theology, but
practical ethics. The theology is just what serves to justify
the ethics. Think about it: when someone is "sermonizing,"
that is, talking like a preacher, they aren't talking about God, are they?
They are talking about ethics (usually _your_ ethics), and usually
trying you to do something different than your habitual behaviors.
Likewise, other church-oriented activites are usually dedicated toward
various self-improvement activities, not just abstract like Bible
study, but practical such as childrearing, job-hunting and the
like. During the week, successful churches usually have a number of
activities, like AA meetings and civic organizations holding court in
the basement. And many churches have very sophisticated social and
antipoverty platforms.

So let's review: here we have an institution that builds social
capital, that focuses on ethics and self-improvement. Isn't this
salient in this time and place? Who wouldn't want to partake in such
organizations?  These are very important concerns - it would seem as
if church membership of some sort, even of the most lax and secular,
would be highly recommended as a part of good citizenship.

Yet church membership has declined. And if you think the problem is
lack of religious belief, there are many organizations that do this
sort of thing without requiring religious belief of any sort, such as
strictly humanist concerns like the Ethical Cultural Society. These
organizations have not fared any better. The problem is that these concerns,
pressing as they are, are not _the_ central concern of people in
society now. Churches will stagnate insofar as they do not meet a
central concern.

One reason it is no longer central is there are so many options for
meeting these same concerns. Take, for example, my secular peer
group. Few of them go to
church. But it isn't as if they are bad people. Perhaps they feel
themselves to be "religious enough" and don't go to church on Sunday
even though they're technically Catholic. Or they're too busy for
religious activities. The only time the do have is Sunday mornings,
but that may be one of the few times of their week that isn't
overscheduled. They can read a book on self-improvement or controlling
their temper, and that may be far more salient than whatever random
sermon the preacher or priest was going to to throw their way.
Such people will generally agree that churches are good and
necessary - but they are not good _for them_, and may even be seen as
irrelevant and time-consuming. The reason, to be blunt, is the
concerns the church addresses are no longer central to their life.

There is one chorch organization that figure out how to appeal to
a central concern the middle of the last century. It has had very
concerning effects.

-----------------------------------------

Before discussing this, let's think of how religious activity became
central, and what it centered around. Because churches really did thrive
when meeting central concerns, and those concerns were quite different than they are at
this time.

Let's look at the Christianity of the European middle ages. Everyone,
without a distinction, was the same form of christian. Everyone
attended. Why did they attend? Well, in many cases, it was
compulsary. You didn't have a choice. But whether you did or not, the
central concern was the same: _to maintain order and stability_.
And I'm not talking about some abstract ideal about "natural order"; I'm
talking about actual physical safety, as in, dying a natural death
instead of at the hands of a robber or maurauder. Unlike the popular
conceptions, life nowadays is far safer than it has ever been. This
counterintuitive fact is behind Steven Pinker's book _The Better
Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined_ dramatically shows
that humankind has gotten remarkably _less_ violent in our
history. While the middle ages were far more violent than we think,
the question to really ask is why it wasn't even more violent than it
was. There was no modern police force, no forensics. Committing a
crime with impunity just required you either have no witnesses (or at
least, no surviving witnesses) or be on the right side of the nobleman
who owned your land. What would have prevented rampant lawlessness and
murder?

The central concern for everyone was order, stability, and
dignity. Religion was dedicated to that central concern.  Part of this
was also making sure everyone was happy with their place in the
world. The latter was a central concern to everyone, albeit for
different reasons. The overwhelming number of people were peasants and
serfs without the freedom to better themselves or their
future. Lacking this agency, the church was likely the only
institution to allow them dignity and purpose. Meanwhile, to the
nobleman, the church was equally useful, to keep the peasants
peaceful. However many armed and armored soldiers a nobleman may have
commanded, he certainly didn't want to risk losing a bunch of them
murdering a raucous band of pitchfork-weilding peasants, especially
not if executing the surviving rioters as an example to others reduced
the manpower available to work on his manor. The usefulness of the
church in supporting order and stability earned church institutions
roles of prominence - even long after centuries of the enlightenment
left its secular power whittled down to a small chunk of what was soon
to became Italy.

Historically, other religions through the world served the same
purpose of providing order, stability and dignity. During the middle
ages, the Islamic world served as the occidental cradle of
civilization, cultivating centers of learning such as Baghdad. But
there too, the central concern was promulgating a law-and-order
orientation, whether in areas that historically had little concept of
civilization such as the Middle East and Spain or seats of fallen
great civilizations in Egypt, the Levant and Byzantia. Whatever you
may think of the Islamic intellectuals that resurrected the Greek
classics and helped build the classic libraries of the Islamic
empires, they exhisted through the indulgence of of noblemen wishing
to keep their new empires pacified. While this resulted in ancient
centers of learning like Bagdhad, the reason Islam found support, like
that of Christianity, was the need for stability, order, and a modicum
of relief for the mass underclass of people propping up various
regimes. My knowledge of the history of the great oriental religions
is poor; but I imagine that if the great religious were a stablizing
force in the occident, then in the orient they were even
moreso. Hinduism itself had at its center a rigid class
system. Buddhism, whatever its virtues as as a "liberating" religion,
tended to live alongside existing folk religions rather than replacing
them.

The net result of all of this, was that all religions shared the same
central core concerns. Not coincidentally, all served on one level the
same promulgation of conventional morality, patriarchy, order,
obedience to authority, belonging and knowing one's place in the
world. Indeed, such beliefs are so traditional religious that the word
"traditionalist" is usually synonymous with these beliefs. If you
think of "conservative religious behavior," that description applies
to many old religions around the world, be they Christian, Buddhist,
Islam, Hindu... you name it.


In the modern world, this concern has changed - and churches did to.
To some extent, if you look at the mainline Christian churches in this
country, some still have a message on of stability and order, but this
is much less emphasised. The emphasis now is more on the tradition,
community and sense of belonging I alluded to earlier. This is exactly
what you would've expected in an era when most people move from rural
farm communities to the new cities that drove manufacturing and the 
industrial economies - restoring the sense of place and community that
these new cities often missed.

As far as the old concerns of order,
whatever one things of "the natural order" is now a point of
contention, and your religion will greatly reflect whatever you think
that order should be. If you are a believer of "the old order," you
may join a wizened arch-conservative congregation, no doubt one that
has many unhappy things to say about the way things are right now. If
you are instead a believer of the new order instituted by
elightenement Europe, where you view your central concern as reason,
logic and peaceful disagreement between others, you will be in a
different sort of demonination: perhaps a Unitarian or Reform Jew.

You may have traditionalist congregations or very liberal
ones that would seem to have nothing in common, yet they do have one
critical thing in common - falling membership.

---------------------------

Earlier, I alluded to the fact that there is a new central concern,
and I'd like to now spell it out. Starting around a hundred fifty
years ago, the American central concern became something quite
different. It wasn't the concerns of the ancient world, of order,
stability and a place in the world. It wasn't the concerns of our
early America citizens, of social order, fitting in, and being a good
citizen. This new concern started during the industrial revolution,
and gathered intellectional force through the newly promulgated
Spencerian attitude of human nature as a competition for
survival. This world view has grown to encompass the world. It is an
individualist, isolating concern, but compelling enough that the
handful of denominations that catered to it are those that now
thrive. This central concern is now:

   Competing and winning.

There is one type of demonination was on the upswing in the
twentieth century. And that was the denomination tailor-made for a
gospel of competing and winning:

    Evangelical Christianity.

Don't believe me? Let's look at what this particular denomination
preaches and what their growth says about society.

While evangelicals have found themselves finally facing the same
stagnation of membership that their mainline bretheren has faced for
years, this is only recently the case. Up until now, the story of the
evangelicals has been one of continued growth. To be clear, the growth
came mostly by way of cannibalizing believers from mainline Protestant
congregations, not by "saving" atheists. The key to their growth? One
factor in the US was a happy accident of social movements in the
sixties; many mainline congregations sided with the civil rights
movement, plenty of believers rebelled by moving to evangelical
congregations which, at the time, were careful to divorce themselves
from politics. Another factor may have been an occasional emphasis by
some sects on procreation as a means of growth. While both
explanations may be valid, they are also easy to
overstate, and neither factor explains why they could retain these new
members.

Instead, these churches have grown by emphasizing society's central
concern. The Evangelical outlook is one of continuous celebration of
victory and winning.

This religion, not so much a religion of Jesus but about Jesus,
describes itself in very distinct language. It is a triumphalist path
of winning and victory, and its appeal is obvious in a society that
prizes winning over all else. It is a path celebrating Jesus' VICTORY
over death, his call to WIN souls to the cause, to WIN hearts and
minds, his eventual TRIUMPH at the end of time. And of course, if one
feels like one is a loser, you can win again by joining. As Jesus will
give you the STRENGTH to BE STRONG in his cause.

Once one looks at the main draw of these churches, the appeal is
obvious. One can become a winner merely by associated oneself with the
winning team - in this case, the Evangelical cause. Indeed, to walk
into a church itself is to see nothing but celebrations of victories
in the cause - large maps of missions established around the world,
charts of growth of memberships and contributions and pro-growth,
triumphalist posters. This growth orientation has a positive upshot
which critics overloook; these churches are completely open. Those
who are antireligious may pigeonhole Evangelicals as being comfortable
with only their own kind (witness the racial segregation of most
congregations), but also overlook how these churches prize and welcome
those outsiders who have decided to join them as "one of them."  Much
could be made of the tribalism of Evangelicals, and much sociology
presumes that a lot of the animating forces behind religions are
tribal in nature. But if there were only tribalism animating this
movement, there would be a lot more arguments about who is a "true
Christian" and who "belongs." Evangelicals are, if nothing else,
evangelical. They want _everyone_ to be on their team. They just want
their team to **win**, and they don't particularly care if everyone is
on the team or not.

Their openness is a positive orientation, and indeed, the world could
use more positivity. But to this writer, there are a lot of downsides
to this orientation. I believe that while this orientation has
provided them victories over the past several decades, it is a curse
that will take years for them to undo. I'll detail the ways in which
this orientation negatively impacts the Christian message they are
supposed to be proclaiming, and how it isn't just Christians that have
made this mistake.

Whatever their intentions, a victory orientation can sometimes lead
to an us-versus-them viewpoint with respect to one's own Faith,
leaching into their other activities. Interfaith activities among
Evangelicals are practically nonexistent. Without Christ, you are
nothing, and those outside the team will not share in the victory. The
ugly side of this triumphalism has taken place in the political realm,
where evangelical masses have chosen to elevate anyone who will
promise them victories, however empty and venal the suit is that makes
this promise.

Sometimes it isn't just moral victories people want. Lately, the only
growing segment in evangelicalism has been the so-called "prosperity
gospel" churches. This has proven particularly powerful for those in
the working class; when life is a struggle for survival, your concerns
are quite different. Its growth in the developing world has been
simply astonishing, full of churches where membership and hefty
contributions are said to be guarantees of worldly riches and
success. Some congregations seem to have more spiritual authority than
a fortune-teller out to empty your bank account. One observer of
Brazil's powerful prosperty gospel churches noted that they seem to be
rackets designed to extract as much money from their congregants as
possible. But they will continue to do so, as these churches appeal to
their members' central concern - greed for some, simple survival for
others.

A tribal outlook, combined with an emphasis on victory, can also lead
evangelicals to overlook the worst among their brethren, to the
detriment of their own cause. Take the "Gospel of Propserity"
churches. While many serious evangelical thinkers are wise enough to
consider this outlook anathema, most preachers generally regard these
sects as "brothers in Christ," in spite of the harm they cause. After
all, prosperty gospel churches are not entirely meritless - some
messages they send regarding old-time basic morality can only be
described as positive, at least in that the members of their
mostly-working-class congregations feel real-world consequences for
drunkenness and immoral behavior. But overall effect of these churches
is to harm their congregants financially with promise of rewards that
will never come. This has subtler ramifications as well. Any
evangelical has at least a few stories about multilevel marketing
schemes that occasionally sweep over their congregation like a virus.

But perhaps the worst problem these churches have is that, willingly
or not, they are propagating a view of human nature that seems to be
one of winning and losing. By accomodiating itself to this mindset, it
validates it for the millions of believers. Given that this mindset is
totally antithetical to Christian thought, then clearly acceptance of
this mindset undercuts the entire declared mission of Christian
churches.

The most spiritually damaged by this mindset are those for whom the
thrill of victory is only complete if you hear the anguish of the
vanquished. The winners are those who look like and act like everyone
in your church; the losers, those who have failed to heed the
call. Over time, this has taken overt political ramifications, as many
congregants have noted that many of society's "winners" have little in
common with the members of their own congregation and do not seem
inclined to joining. So winning then consists of seizing power and
using it not for good, but for punishing those who they consider
evil. Now, you won't hear messages of punishing others coming from the
pastors of these churches. The focus of the pastors is, after all,
centered on the message of Jesus, and my experience is that those
message are usually ostensibly apolitical. But evangelical churches
aren't run by pastors; they are run by the church boards, who hire and
fire pastors based on how much they like their sermons and how many
people they bring in. It is these boards that have been so aggresive
in pushing voter guides, and it is those boards who do what they can
to ensure that their congregants come out as "winners" in real life.

This win-lose orientation hasn't damaged just
Christianity. Evangelical and prosperity gospel churches, whatever
their faults, are not the worst in this regard, merely the largest
numerically. Many other religions have catered to this urge, some with
very ill effects. Indeed, many of the new religious movements have not
been subtle about positioning their spiritual beliefs as a
"technology" by which one can transform oneself from a loser into a
winner. Witness Scientology, a religion which seems to be nothing more
than an elaborate self-help methodology reclassified as a religious
movement to avoid clinical validation and tax reprecussions. In all
too many cases, these new religious movements have adopted a "pyramid
scheme" manner of recruiting akin to a multilevel marketing
organizations, where "winners" are determined based on how many bodies
they have brought into the cause. These movements have nothing to do
with the attitudes and outlooks that animated the great religions, no
matter what they claim their tax status is.

This sort of evangelical outlook on winning can infect believers in
religions where the doctrines specifically reject this view. Indeed,
my own Baha'i Faith had intimations of this when I joined in 1994. The
Baha'i Faith is evangelical in the sense it has a message it needs to
carry to the world, and indeed prophecies in very ambiguous terms a
future powerful role in humanity's destiny; but it also has
countervailing teachings to avoid pressuring others, to not press the
message on others, and view setbacks as a necessary part of community
building. However, when I joined in 1994, the Baha'i Faith was at the
end of a once-in-a-lifetime explosion that took it from less than 20
thousand believers to over 150 thousand believers in the US in the
span of less 30 years, followed by a screeching hald to growth in the
late eighties. This led to a sense among some Baha'is that their Faith
had stopped "winning" among some Baha'is - a hangover that left many
Baha'is wrongly questioning themselves and the community about a
situation that was entirely environmental in nature. Fortunately, the
wiser Baha'is I knew were those able to keep their perspective.

While the temptation to appeal to this message is one that many
religions will fall for, the Evangelical movement may be the one that
will eventually suffer the most for it. Particularly because of their
eager political engagement and their backing of politicians who put
winning above all else, Evangelicals have not only undercut their
mission, but have sullied their reputation for generations in the
US. How many youth now coming of age think only of prosperity gospel
churches as rackets for greedy preachers? How many young people have
only experienced evangelical believers as tribal foes unmoored by
their own religious claims, out simply for political power? Yet from
the broad scope, it seems these churches have simply given people what
they wanted.

--------------------------------------

Is there a solution? It seems so obvious that it's surprising
denominations people haven't addressed it. But I think that it has to
be the central message of the current age. This message is far more
realistic, given the situation that humankind now has in this stage in
its development:

    It's not about winning and losing.

There were inklings of this in some of the new religious movements
that caught on in "the hippie era." Certainly, there were inklings of
the "turn on tune in drop out" of this period. But I believe this
important mesage is overlooked by many denominations. It seems even
those denominations whose goal is not "winning" still feel the need to
"compete in the religious marketplace."

In the US, I feel that perhaps the most direct beneficiary of this
message is the nascent indigenous Buddhist community. By "indigenous,"
I'm referring to the distinctly American version pioneered by thinkers
like Alan Watts and popularized by celebrities such as Richard
Gere. This variant of Buddhism strictly de-emphasises any theological
discussions; is sometimes overtly atheistic; is more individualistic
in nature; and is very much focused on the practices of Buddhism such
as meditation, detachment and focus on the self. This variant of
Buddhism, while still very much a minority religion, has at least
managed to claim a decent amount of believers among the intellectual
class, and enjoys an image of scientific respectibility as shown in
books such as [_Why Buddhism is
True_](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Buddhism-True-Philosophy-Enlightenment-ebook/dp/B01MPZNG63/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1541260192&sr=8-1&keywords=why+buddhism+is+true).

My own personal inclination is that the American variant is
insufficiently focused on social action. It is also a little too
individualistic in nature. This is a personal opinion and is not meant
as a condemnation of Buddhism as such, or even the American
variant. But plainly, this is a religion of individual practice, not
of community, and it is a long way removed from the curches of our
forefathers that spent more time on community and shared activity than
on actual spiritual practices. (Indeed, the more traditional Buddhist
temples that cater to immigrant communities are far more "churchlike,"
with weekly rituals, calendars of community activities, and dedicated
priesthoods that call to mind a far less exotic parish church.)

But for the average US citizen - whether they feel themselves to be a
loser, a winner, or "a winner who still feels like a loser" -
Buddhism has a perfect solution: winning and losing is fake and it
doesn't matter. There is no struggle for survival or existence. The
struggle is entirely of your making, and is created by your cravings.
This realization is the most powerful insight Buddhism has.  Once one
realizes this, it completely robs many of these other competing
denominations of their power. How important is it to be on the winning
team, if you have adopted practices and beliefs that regard the whole
concept of winning and losing as pointless exercises, products of
egoistical thinking that have not place in today's time and age?

Here is a religious community that seems to have figured out what the
new central concern is. And they have done it without compromising
their core beliefs in any way! I may grouse that this community is a
little too proud of an atheism that has far more to do with current
intellectual fashions than the original teachings of its founder; the
monks representing countires with long learned traditions of Buddhism
may feel that divorcing the practices of Buddhism from key articles of
doctrine such as reincarnation and rebirth lead to an arid secular
practice far removed from their own beliefs. Yet in spite of this,
this movement seems to have animated the beliefs of many people who to
this point have had little use for any sort of religion.

Now, think of this message being harnessed by other belief systems -
religions that eschew tribalism, religions that refuse to validate the
all-too-human urge to claim victory over others. Instead, communities
that teach their believers to look past such struggles, and focus on
their mandate as a religious community. The next phase of religious
history belongs to those willing to harness this need into service for
greater good - for both their own believers and mankind in general.
