# The Winner's Curse and Christianity

I was doing some thinking, as I always do, about the general lack of
interest in religion. By that, I don't necessarily mean lack of
interest in theology. I am more referring to the fact that people
generally don't find religious practices themselves - attendance at
church and associated activites - valuable to their lives. The area I
live in is a part of the country that is notably secular, so my
perceptions may appear to be a bit skewed. But given the way the
younger generations are moving away from religion, I suspect this will
be of broader concern over time.

The question, really, is what people think religion does for
them. Most people profess little interest in theology or
philosophy. They practice a form of belief I've heard called
aganotology - one who doesn't care if there is a God or not. While
some of this can be chalked up to "secularism," I think this is much
as it always is. I doubt very much that when church membership was
stronger, that there was much emphasis on actual hard issues of belief
or theology. Had there been, the pulpits would have thundered with
discussions of Augustine and Aquainas, and the discussions in the
twentieth century would have added such names as Tillich and Kung and
the British idealists like Bradley into the mix. I'm quite sure the
only Christian churches that fit that description were the oddball
churches on college campuses catering to weirdos like me, who were in
bed by midnight on a Saturday night and had nothing else to do on a
Sunday morning.

Instead, there have generally been a few other things people
participated in church or religious activities for.  The most
trivial-sounding but important reason is simply simply convention and
a sense of belonging; you did it because your parents did it, and you
wanted your kids to do it to. From that point of view, this may not
necessarily be all that bad; the church became a form of social
capital. It helped to make groups of people in the same neighborhood
in a community, people who might not ordinarily come together.

Another one is ethical. For most part, religion is not theology, but
really practical ethics. The theology is just what serves to justify
the ethics. Think about it: when someone is "sermonizing,"
i.e. talking like a preacher, they aren't talking about God, are they?
They are talking about ethics (usually _your_ ethics), and usually
trying you to do something different than your habitual behaviors.

Likewise, other church-oriented activites are usually dedicated toward
various self-improvement activities, not just abstract like Bible
study, but practical such as childrearing, job-hunting and the
like. During the week, successful churches usually have a number of
activities, like AA meetings and civic organizations holding court in
the basement. And many churches have very sophisticated social and
antipoverty platforms.

So let's review: an institution that builds social capital, that
focuses on ethics and self-improvement: isn't this salient in this
time and place? Who wouldn't want to partake in such organizations?
These are very important concerns - it would seem as if church
membership of some sort, even secular, would be highly recommended as
a part of good citizenship.

Yet church membership has declined. And if you think the problem is
lack of religious belief, there are many organizations that do this
sort of thing without religious belief (for example, the Ethical
Cultural Society) that also have seen a drop in membership. The
problem is that these concerns, pressing as they are, are not _the_
central concern of people in society now. Churches will stagnate
insofar as they do not meet a central concern.

For example, let's look at my secular peer group. Few of them go to
church. But it isn't as if they are bad people. Perhaps they feel
themselves to be "religious enough" and don't go to church on Sunday
even though they're technically Catholic. Or they're too busy for
religious activities. The only time the do have is Sunday mornings,
but that may be one of the few times of their week that isn't
overscheduled. They can read a book on self-improvement or controlling
their temper, and that may be far more salient than whatever random
sermon the preacher or priest was going to to throw their way.

Such people will generally agree that churches are good and
necessary. But they are not good _for them_, and may even be seen as
irrelevant and time-consuming. The reason, to be blunt, is the
concerns the church addresses are no longer central to their life.

Our central concern is one much more individualistic and insidous than
in the past, and a number of religious organizations have attempted to
use that, purposely or not, for ends that are entirely irreligious.

But before that, a digression on how we got here.

-----------------------------------------

Let's take a step back. At one time, religious of some sort was truly
universal, it did center around the central concerns of life. And
those concerns were quite different than they are at this time.

Let's look at the Christianity of the European middle ages. Everyone,
without a distinction, was the same form of christian. Everyone
attended. Why did they attend? Well, in many cases, it was
compulsary. You didn't have a choice. But whether you did or not, the
central concern was the same: _to maintain order and stability_.

Steven Pinker's _The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has
Declined_ dramatically shows that humankind has gotten remarkably
_less_ violent in our history, and the modern age is especially
nonviolent. In the middle ages, it wasn't that everything was
peaceful. But when you think about it, the question isn't why it was
so violent, but why it wasn't even more violent. There was no modern
police force, no forensics. Committing a crime with impunity just
required you either have no witnesses, be brutal and inefficent about
getting rid of what witnesses existed, or be on the right side of the
nobleman who owned your land. What would have prevented rampant
lawlessness and murder?

The central concern for everyone was order, stability, and
dignity. Religion was dedicated to that central concern.  Part of this
was also making sure everyone was happy with their place in the
world. The latter was a central concern to everyone, albeit for
different reasons. The overwhelming number of people were peasants and
serfs without the freedom to better themselves or their
future. Lacking this agency, the church was likely the only
institution to allow them dignity and purpose. Meanwhile, to the
nobleman, the church was equally useful, to keep the peasants
peaceful. However many armed soldiers a nobleman may have commanded,
he certainly didn't want to risk losing a bunch of them
murdering a raucous band of pitchfork-weilding peasants, especially
not if executing the surviving rioters as an example to others reduced
the manpower available to work on his manor. The usefulness of the
church in supporting order and stability earned church institutions
roles of prominence - even long after centuries of the enlightenment
left its secular power whittled down to a small chunk of what was soon
to became Italy.

Historically, other religions through the world served the same
purpose of providing order, stability and dignity. During the middle
ages, the Islamic world served as the occidental cradle of
civilization, cultivating centers of learning such as Baghdad. But
there too, the central concern was promulgating a law-and-order
orientation, whether in areas that historically had little concept of
civilization such as the Middle East and much of North Africa, or
seats of fallen great civilizations in Egypt, the Levant and
Byzantia. Whatever you may think of the Islamic intellectuals that
resurrected the Greek classics and helped build the classic libraries
of the Islamic empires, they exhisted through the indulgence of of
noblemen as much as their European couterparts toiling in Irish
monastaries. This grand history may serve as a point of pride for
today's Muslim intellectuals, but the goal of Islam, like that of
Christianity, was stability, order, and a modicum of relief for the
mass underclass of people propping up various regimes.

My knowledge of the history of the great oriental religions is poor;
but I imagine that if the great religious were a stablizing force in
the occident, then in the orient they were even moreso. Hinduism
itself had at its center a rigid class system. Buddhism, whatever its
virtues as as a "liberating" religion, tended to live alongside
existing folk religions rather than replacing them.  The net result -
all religions shared the same central core concerns.  This meant the
promulgation of conventional morality, patriarchy, order, obedience to
authority, belonging and knowing one's place in the world.

Indeed, such beliefs are so traditional that the word
"traditionalist" is usually synonymous with these beliefs. If you
think of "conservative religious behavior," that description applies
to many old religions around the world, be they Christian, Buddhist,
Islam, Hindu... you name it.

To some extent, if you look at the mainline Christian churches in this
country, some still have a message on of stability and order, but this
is much less emphasised. It is more the tradition, community and sense
of belonging I alluded to earlier. Part of this is because whatever
one things of "the natural order" is now a point of contention, and
your religion will greatly reflect whatever you think that order
should be. If you are a believer of "the old order," you may join a
wizened arch-conservative congregation, no doubt one that has many
unhappy things to say about the way things are right now. If you are
instead a believer of the new order instituted by elightenement
Europe, where you view your central concern as reason, logic and
peaceful disagreement between others, you will be in a different sort
of demonination: perhaps a Unitarian or Reform Jew.

---------------------------

There is one other things these arch-conservatives to liberals have in
common - falling memberships. Starting around a hundred fifty years
ago, the American central concern became something quite different. It
wasn't the concerns of the ancient world, of order, stability and a
place in the world. It wasn't the concerns of our early America
citizens, of social order, fitting in, and being a good citizen. This
new concern started during the industrial revolution, and gathered
intellectional force through the newly promulgated Spencerian attitude
of human nature as a competition for survival. This world view has
grown to encompass the world. It is an individualist, isolating
concern, but compelling enough that the handful of denominations that
catered to it are those that now thrive. This central concern is now:

   Competing and winning.

There is one type of demonination was on the upswing in the
twentieth century. And that was the denomination tailor-made for a
gospel of competing and winning:

    Evangelical Christianity.

Don't believe me? Let's look at what this particular denomination
preaches and what their growth says about society.

While evangelicals have found themselves finally facing the same
stagnation of membership that their mainline bretheren has faced for
years, this is only recently the case. Up until now, the story of the
evangelicals has been one of continued growth. To be clear, the growth
came mostly by way of cannibalizing believers from mainline Protestant
congregations, not by "saving" atheists. The key to their growth? One
factor was no doubt the effect of the sixties, in which many mainline
congregations sided with the civil rights movement; those unwilling to
listen found it easier to move to an evangelical congregations which,
at the time, were careful to divorce themselves from politics. Another
is an occasional emphasis by some sects on procreation as a means of
growth. While both explanations of their growth may be valid, they are also
easy to overstate, and neither explains why they were able to retain
their new members. It also overlooks the source of the Evangelical
appeal.

The Evangelical outlook is one of continuous celebration of victory
and winning.

One of the knocks against these churches is they practice "a religion
about Jesus instead of a religion of Jesus," but that is a criticism
that is fairly easy to level against any creed or philosophy. Any
creed of idealistic intent is going to be aspirational, something one
reaches for rather than actualizes every day. It is necessary to
talk about the path in addition to walking the path, if only to remind
everyone.

But it is true that this religion about Jesus is described in a very
distinctive way. It is a triumphalist path of winning and victory, and
its appeal is obvious in a society that prizes winning over all
else. It is a path celebrating Jesus' VICTORY over death, his call to
WIN souls to the cause, to WIN hearts and minds, his eventual TRIUMPH
at the end of time. And of course, if one feels like one is a loser,
you can win again by joining. As Jesus will give you the STRENGTH to
BE STRONG in his cause.

Once one looks at the main draw of these churches, the appeal is
obvious. One can become a winner merely by associated oneself with the
winning team - in this case, the Evangelical cause. Indeed, to walk
into a church itself is to see nothing but celebrations of victories
in the cause - large maps of missions established around the world,
charts of growth of memberships and contributions and pro-growth,
triumphalist posters. This growth orientation has a positive upshow
which critics overloook; these churches are nothing if not open. Those
who are antireligious may pigeonhole Evangelicals as being comfortable
with only their own kind (witness the racial segregation of most
congregations), but also overlook how these churches prize and welcome
those outsiders who have decided to join them as "one of them."  Much
could be made of the tribalism of Evangelicals, and much sociology
presumes that a lot of the animating forces behind religions are
tribal in nature. But if there were only tribalism animating this
movement, there would be a lot more arguments about who is a "true
Christian" and who "belongs." Evangelicals are, if nothing else,
evangelical. They want _everyone_ to be on their team. They just want
their team to **win**, and they don't particularly care if everyone is
on the team or not.

However, whatever their intentions, this victory orientation leads to
an us-versus-them viewpoint, and it is easy to see this this leaching
into their other activities. Interfaith activities among Evangelicals
are practically nonexistent. Without Christ, you are nothing, and
those outside the team will not share in the victory. Eventually, one
sees the ugly side of this triumphalism. In the political realm, the
masses generally vote for anyone who will promise them victories,
however empty the suit is that makes this promise.

Fortunately or unfortunately, the more pure strains of evangelism now
find themselves on the decline, with the so called "prosperity gospel"
churches perhaps being the only ascendant strain. For many, the
emphasis on inner victories have themselves not proven central enough,
with their life becoming a stuggle for survival. When life is a
struggle for survival, your concerns are even different. Thus, we
witness the growth of "prosperity gospel" churches both here and in
the developing world, where membership and hefty contributions are
said to be guarantees of worldly riches and success. Some
congregations have been turned into huge rackets with no more
spiritual authority than a fortune-teller out to empty your bank
account. As one observer of Brazil's powerful prosperty gospel
churches noted, they seem to be rackets designed to extract as much
money from their congregants as possible. But they will continue to do
so, as these churches appeal to their members central concern - greed
for some, simple survival for others.

Additionally, a tribal outlook, combined with an emphasis on victory,
lead evangelicals to overlook the worst among their brethren, to the
detriment of their own cause. Take the "Gospel of Propserity"
churches. While many serious evangelical thinkers are wise enough to
consider this outlook anathema, most preachers generally regard these
sects as "brothers in Christ," in spite of the harm they cause. After
all, prosperty gospel churches are not entirely meritless - some
messages they send regarding old-time basic morality can only be
described as positive, at least in that the members of their
mostly-working-class congregations feel real-world consequences for
drunkenness and immoral behavior. But overall effect of these churches
is to harm their congregants financially with promise of rewards that
will never come. This has subtler ramifications as well. Any
evangelical has at least a few stories about multilevel marketing
schemes that occasionally sweep over their congregation like a virus.

-------------------------------------

In any event, it seems both evangelical and prosperity gospel churches
have found their niche, appealing to basic needs and wants. Is there a
problem with this?

There are plenty. The most evident is the fact that
by accomodiating itself to this mindset, it validates it for the
millions of believers. Given that this mindset is totally antithetical
to Christian thought, then clearly acceptance of this mindset
undercuts the entire declared mission of Christian churches.

It is worst for those on the evangelical team for whom the thrill of
victory is only complete if you hear the anguish of the
vanquished. The winners are those who look like and act like everyone
in your church; the losers, those who have failed to heed the
call. Over time, this has taken overt political ramifications, as many
congregants have noted that many of society's "winners" have little in
common with the members of their own congregation; nor do those
winners seem receptive to joining. Winning for these tribal
evangelicals then consists of seizing power and using it not for good,
but for punishing what they consider evil. Now, you won't hear
messages of punishing others coming from the pastors of these
churches; the focus of the pastors is, after all, centered on the
message of Jesus and many times remains ostensibly apolitical. But
evangelical churches aren't run by pastors; they are run by the church
boards, who hire and fire pastors based on how much they like their
sermons and how many people they bring in. It is these boards that
have been so aggresive in pushing voter guides, and it is those boards
who do what they can to ensure that their congregants come out as
"winners" in real life.

Evangelical and prosperity gospel churches, whatever their faults, are
not the worst in this regard, merely the largest numerically. Nor is
this outlook confined to Christian churches.  Indeed, many of the new
religious movements have not been subtle about positioning their
spiritual beliefs as a "technology" by which one can transform oneself
from a loser into a winner. Witness Scientology, a religion which
seems to be nothing more than an elaborate self-help methodology
reclassified as a religious movement to avoid clinical validation and
tax reprecussions. In all too many cases, these new religious
movements have adopted a "pyramid scheme" manner of recruiting akin to
a multilevel marketing organizations, where "winners" are determined
based on how many bodies they have brought into the cause. These
movements have nothing to do with the attitudes and outlooks that
animated the great religions, no matter what they claim their tax
status is.

This sort of evangelical outlook on winning can infect believers in
religions where the doctrines specifically reject this view. Indeed,
my own Baha'i Faith had intimations of this when I joined in 1994. The
Baha'i Faith is evangelical in the sense it has a message it needs to
carry to the world, and indeed prophecies in very ambiguous terms a
future powerful role in humanity's destiny; but it also has
countervailing teachings to avoid pressuring others, to not press the
message on others, and view setbacks as a necessary part of community
building. However, when I joined in 1994, the Baha'i Faith was at the
end of a once-in-a-lifetime explosion that took it from less than 20
thousand believers to over 150 thousand believers in the US in the
span of 30 years. When growth suddenly tailed off in the late
eighties, there was a sense the Baha'i Faith had stopped "winning"
among some Baha'is - a hangover that left many Baha'is wrongly
questioning themselves and the community about a situation that was
entirely environmental in nature. Fortunately, the wiser Baha'is I
knew were those able to keep their perspective.

So it seems there is a desire for individuals to "win" in today's
society; the beneficiaries are churches that individually cater to
that and promise solutions. Yet in doing so, the churches undercut
their own mission by ratifying this desire instead of challenging this
underlying assumption. Indeed, due to their eager political engagement
and their backing of politicians who put winning above all else, they
not only undercut their mission, but their reputation. How many youth
now coming of age think only of prosperity gospel churches as rackets
for greedy preachers? How many young people have only experienced
evangelical believers as tribal foes unguided by their own religious
claims? Yet from the broad scope, it seems these churches have simply
given people what they wanted.

--------------------------------------

Is there a solution? It seems so obvious that it's surprising
denominations people haven't addressed it. But I think that it has to
be the central message of the current age. This message is far more
realistic, given the situation that humankind now has in this stage in
its development:

    It's not about winning and losing.

There were inklings of this in some of the new religious movements
that caught on in "the hippie era." Certainly, there were inklings of
the "turn on tune in drop out" of this period. But I believe this
important mesage is overlooked by many denominations. It seems even
those denominations whose goal is not "winning" still feel the need to
"compete in the religious marketplace."

In the US, I feel that perhaps the most direct beneficiary of this
message is the nascent indigenous Buddhist community. By "indigenous,"
I'm referring to the distinctly American version pioneered by thinkers
like Alan Watts and popularized by celebrities such as Richard
Gere. This variant of Buddhism strictly de-emphasises any theological
discussions; is sometimes overtly atheistic; is more individualistic
in nature; and is very much focused on the practices of Buddhism such
as meditation, detachment and focus on the self. This variant of
Buddhism, while still very much a minority religion, has at least
managed to claim a decent amount of believers among the intellectual
class, and enjoys an image of scientific respectibility as shown in
books such as [_Why Buddhism is
True_](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Buddhism-True-Philosophy-Enlightenment-ebook/dp/B01MPZNG63/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1541260192&sr=8-1&keywords=why+buddhism+is+true).

My own personal inclination is that the American variant is
insufficiently focused on social action. It is also a little too
individualistic in nature. This is a personal opinion and is not meant
as a condemnation of Buddhism as such, or even the American
variant. But plainly, this is a religion of individual practice, not
of community, and it is a long way removed from the curches of our
forefathers that spent more time on community and shared activity than
on actual spiritual practices. (Indeed, the more traditional Buddhist
temples catering to immigrant communities are far more "churchlike"
with their weekly rituals and calendar of community activities.)

But for the average US citizen - whether they feel themselves to be a
loser, an winner, or "a winner who still doesn't feel like one" -
Buddhism has a perfect solution: winning and losing is fake and it
doesn't matter. There is no struggle for survival or existence. The
struggle is entirely of your making, and is created by your cravings.
This realization is the most powerful insight Buddhism has.  Once one
realizes this it completely robs many of these other competing
denominations of their power. How important is it to be on the winning
team, if you have adopted practices and beliefs that regard the whole
concept of winning and losing as pointless exercises, products of
egoistical thinking that have not place in today's time and age?

So in spite of whatever I my persionally feel, this is the religious
community that seems to have figured out what the new central concern
is. And they have done it without compromising their core beliefs in
any way! I may grouse that this community is a little too proud of an
atheism that has far more to do with current intellectual fashions
than the original teachings of its founder; the monks representing
countires with long learned traditions of Buddhism may feel that
divorcing the practices of Buddhism from key articles of doctrine such
as reincarnation and rebirth lead to just an arid secular
practice. Yet in spite of this, this movement seems to have animated
the beliefs of many people who to this point have had little use for
any sort of religion.

Now, think of this message being harnessed by other belief systems -
religions that eschew tribalism, religions that refuse to validate the
all-too-human urge to claim victory over others and teach their
believers to look past such struggles. The next phase of religious
history belongs to those willing to harness this need into service for
greater good for both their own believers and mankind in general.
