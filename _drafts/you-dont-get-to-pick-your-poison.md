## Race in America (Or: You Don't Get to Pick Your Poison)

Race relations, at least seemingly, are at a low point in this
country. Or at least, this is how it is viewed by some people. In
reality, it has never been that good. Admittedly, it is good for _some
people_, such as myself - while I realize things are bad for many
blacks, those I know in my circle are those who have managed to do
well enough that they aren't obvious targets. As for actual friends,
my lack of black friends is matched by my lack of white friends.

But unfortunately, the question must turn to what to do. This may be
the reason this issue is rarely discussed - even among those who agree
there is a problem, there is nothing obvious to be done. "The
problem," such as it is, is most obviously embodied by white racists,
who are not surprisingly completely outside of the social circles of
those that are concerned by this fact. The whites who do have racist
relations have found such people to be impervious to reason to an
almost perverse degree, and in any case consider lack of contact with
such people to be a precious benefit. And obviously, African-Americans
do not want to deal with such people - the mere fact such people are
allowed to exist in polite society and law enforcement is perhaps the
worst embodiment of racism that there is.

This formulation, however, is not too hard, but too easy. It lets
people off the hook, while at the same time leaving the problem in the
hands of those who wish to perpetuate it. Obviously, it would be ideal
if the solution laid among those of good will, where racists can be
excluded.

Fortunately, there is a solution. It lies in the writings of Baha'i
authority Shoghi Effendi.

Shoghi Effendi was the leader of the Baha'i community during the
1920-1950 timeframe. He had a rather nasty problem himself with racism
as it existed in the Baha'i community. This was even more problematic,
because the Baha'i Faith is a religious community, one that explicitly
forbids prejudice and racism! However, in spite of the leadership
shown by the prior leader, Abdu'l-Baha, many community members found
it all to easy to follow the lead of society, by having defacto
self-segregated communities for instance.

Shoghi Effendi lived in the then-territory of Palestine, and unlike
Abdu'l-Baha, never visited America. The most he could realistically do
is give guidance. But the guidance he gave was instructive. The most
significant writing to this was a book-length letter to the Baha'i
community in America titled _The Advent of Divine Justice_. Written in
the late 1930s, it covered a broad range of issues, but spent several
pages writing about how the Baha'i Faith must address the issue of
race, both within its ranks and in society at large.

The guidance is notable, in that it does not give the same guidance to
whites and African-Americans! It does not make the mistake of giving
in to half-hearted urges of "tolerance" and "seeing beyound race."
Instead, it gives specific instructions, that differ. To the whites he says:

> Let the white make a supreme effort in their resolve to contribute
> their share to the solution of this problem, to abandon once for all
> their usually inherent and at times subconscious sense of superiority,
> to correct their tendency towards revealing a patronizing attitude
> towards the members of the other race, to persuade them through their
> intimate, spontaneous and informal association with them of the
> genuineness of their friendship and the sincerity of their intentions,
> and to master their impatience of any lack of responsiveness on the
> part of a people who have received, for so long a period, such
> grievous and slow-healing wounds.

African-Americans get their own tasks. Though one might view these as
easier than those assigned to whites, that is only right, and it does
not mean they are difficult tasks. (Important aside regarding
vocabulary: please keep in mind that this passage was written in 1937,
when the term "Negroes" was the proper term to use. Tempted as I am to
"correct" or leave it out, I will respect the author and leave it intact.)

> Let the Negroes*, through a
> corresponding effort on their part, show by every means in their power
> the warmth of their response, their readiness to forget the past, and
> their ability to wipe out every trace of suspicion that may still
> linger in their hearts and minds.

And finally, those that must be carried out by both:

> Let neither think that the solution
> of so vast a problem is a matter that exclusively concerns the
> other. Let neither think that such a problem can either easily or
> immediately be resolved. Let neither think that they can wait
> confidently for the solution of this problem until the initiative has
> been taken, and the favorable circumstances created, by agencies that
> stand outside the orbit of their Faith. Let neither think that
> anything short of genuine love, extreme patience, true humility,
> consummate tact, sound initiative, mature wisdom, and deliberate,
> persistent, and prayerful effort, can succeed in blotting out the
> stain which this patent evil has left on the fair name of their common
> country. Let them rather believe, and be firmly convinced, that on
> their mutual understanding, their amity, and sustained cooperation,
> must depend, more than on any other force or organization operating
> outside the circle of their Faith, the deflection of that dangerous
> course so greatly feared by ‘Abdu’l Bahá, and the materialization of
> the hopes He cherished for their joint contribution to the fulfillment
> of that country’s glorious destiny.

To some extent, those of the African-Americans are those they have to
bear anyway as citizens of society. While we can think of plenty of
whites who aren't keeping up their end of this, there are very few
African-Americans that I have met who don't keep up their end of the
solution. Those who think, for example, that African-Americans are
insufficiently deferential to law enforement are generally those who
come into very little contact with that community.

In short, the resolution of the issue of race relations in this country
is solvable. It lies within the grasp of those of good will. And it is
primarily the responsiblity of those who are in the majority in this
country anyway: the whites.

The challenge, then, is not determine what is to do, but instead
become determined to "plow one's own row." One must concentrate on
what one's own community must do, and not get distractd by any
perceived failure of response by the other community. Remember that
there are others of ill will in both your community and the others;
this is not under your control, or under the control of those you
affiliate with in that community. Only in this manner can you and your
organization lead the way forward, and only by leading can the rest of
the community follow.
