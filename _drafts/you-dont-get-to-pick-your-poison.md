## Race in America (Or: You Don't Get to Pick Your Poison)

Race relations, at least seemingly, are at a low point in this
country. Or at least, this is how it is viewed by some people. In
reality, it has never been that good. Admittedly, it is good for _some
people_, such as myself - while I realize things are bad for many
blacks, those I know in my circle are those who have managed to do
well enough that they aren't obvious targets. As for actual friends,
my lack of black friends is matched by my lack of white friends.

But unfortunately, the question must turn to _what to do._ This
uncomfortable fact may be the reason this issue is rarely discussed.
Even among those who agree there is a problem, there is nothing
obvious that can easily be done by those of good will. "The problem of
racism," such as it is, is most obviously embodied by white racists,
particularly those in positions of authority. Not surprisingly, these
people seem completely outside of the social circles of the whites who
are concerned by racism. This is for a very good reason: most whites
who do have racist relations have found such people to be impervious
to reason to an almost perverse degree, to they extent that they
consider lack of contact with such people to be a precious
benefit. Meanwhile, there are few African-Americans who are willing to
risk their neck to "educate" these people; indeed, they may rightly
feel that the fact such people are allowed at all as authority figures
in politics and law enforcement is the worst embodiment of racism
society holds in store for them. This seems to place the problem out
of the control of either the whites or blacks who wish to move forward.

If you may suspect that this pat formulation is either too hopeless or
too easy, you are right on either count. It lets those who are
concerned off the hook, while at the same time leaving the problem in the
hands of those who wish to perpetuate it. Obviously, it would be ideal
if the solution laid among those of good will, where racists can be
excluded. Is there such a solution?

In fact, there is! It lies in the writings of Baha'i authority Shoghi
Effendi. It is rather nonobvious.

Shoghi Effendi was the leader of the Baha'i community during the
1920-1950 timeframe. He had a rather nasty problem himself with racism
as it existed in the Baha'i community. The existence of racism was
especially problematic in the Baha'i community, because the Baha'i
Faith is a religious community, one that explicitly forbids prejudice
and racism! In spite of the leadership shown by the prior leader,
Abdu'l-Baha, many community members found it all to easy to follow the
lead of society, by having defacto self-segregated communities for
instance within prominent communities such as Washington D.C.

Shoghi Effendi lived in the then-territory of Palestine, and unlike
Abdu'l-Baha, never visited America. The most he could realistically do
was give guidance. But the guidance he gave was timely and
critical. While he wrote repeatedly to his fellow American believers
on this subject over the course of his thirty-odd year tenure as
leader of the Baha'i Faith, his most significant writing on this topic
came in a book-length letter to the Baha'i community in America titled
_The Advent of Divine Justice_. Written in the late 1930s, it covered
a broad range of issues, but spent several pages writing about how the
Baha'i Faith must address the issue of race, both within its ranks and
in society at large. It is referred to by American Baha'is even to
this day.

The guidance is notable, in that it does not give the same guidance to
whites and African-Americans! It does not make the mistake of giving
in to half-hearted urges of "tolerance" and "seeing beyound race."
Instead, it gives specific instructions, that differ based on the race
of the believer. To the whites he says:

> Let the white make a supreme effort in their resolve to contribute
> their share to the solution of this problem, to abandon once for all
> their usually inherent and at times subconscious sense of superiority,
> to correct their tendency towards revealing a patronizing attitude
> towards the members of the other race, to persuade them through their
> intimate, spontaneous and informal association with them of the
> genuineness of their friendship and the sincerity of their intentions,
> and to master their impatience of any lack of responsiveness on the
> part of a people who have received, for so long a period, such
> grievous and slow-healing wounds.

African-Americans get their own tasks. Though one might view these as
easier than those assigned to whites, that is only right, and it does
not mean they are not difficult tasks. (Important aside regarding
vocabulary: please keep in mind that this passage was written in 1937,
when the term "Negroes" was the proper term to use. Tempted as I am to
"correct" or leave it out, I will respect the author and leave it intact.)

> Let the Negroes, through a
> corresponding effort on their part, show by every means in their power
> the warmth of their response, their readiness to forget the past, and
> their ability to wipe out every trace of suspicion that may still
> linger in their hearts and minds.

And finally, there are those tasks that must be carried out by both blacks
and whites:

> Let neither think that the solution
> of so vast a problem is a matter that exclusively concerns the
> other. Let neither think that such a problem can either easily or
> immediately be resolved. Let neither think that they can wait
> confidently for the solution of this problem until the initiative has
> been taken, and the favorable circumstances created, by agencies that
> stand outside the orbit of their Faith. Let neither think that
> anything short of genuine love, extreme patience, true humility,
> consummate tact, sound initiative, mature wisdom, and deliberate,
> persistent, and prayerful effort, can succeed in blotting out the
> stain which this patent evil has left on the fair name of their common
> country. Let them rather believe, and be firmly convinced, that on
> their mutual understanding, their amity, and sustained cooperation,
> must depend, more than on any other force or organization operating
> outside the circle of their Faith, the deflection of that dangerous
> course so greatly feared by ‘Abdu’l Bahá, and the materialization of
> the hopes He cherished for their joint contribution to the fulfillment
> of that country’s glorious destiny.

While we can think of plenty of whites who aren't keeping up their end
of this, there are very few African-Americans that I have met who
don't keep up their end of the solution.

In short, the resolution of the issue of race relations in this country
is solvable. It lies within the grasp of those of good will. And it is
primarily the responsiblity of those who are in the majority in this
country anyway: the whites.

The challenge, then, is not determine what _society_ should do, but
instead become determined to "plow one's own row." One must
concentrate on what oneself must do within one's own community, and
not get distractd by any perceived failure of response by
others. Remember that there will be others of ill will that you will
meet; this is not under your control. Instead, befriend who you can
and do what you can to help. You don't get to pick your poison, but
you can act on your duties, knowing it will make a difference. Only in
this manner can you and your organization lead the way forward, and
only by leading can allow the rest of the community to follow.
