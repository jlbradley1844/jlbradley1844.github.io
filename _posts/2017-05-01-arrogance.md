ar·ro·gant
[ˈerəɡənt]

ADJECTIVE:
having or revealing an exaggerated sense of one's own importance or abilities.

Let's take the above word. Supposing someone believes that a certain
"type" of person is arrogant. There are actually two ways one can
be labeled as arrogant:

1. Actually deserve it; that is, reveal an exaggerated sense of
importance or abilities due to claimed beliefs or thoughts.

2. Reveal *any* sense of importance  or confidence in one's opinion to
someone else who is trained to disregard or think of you as beneath him.

Definition #2 is not the dictionary definition, but I seem to see it
used a whole lot.

Of course, I've been called arrogant a time or two. Actually, just
once that I know of. But if you get called it once, there are probably
a few times you've been called this behind your back. Am I really an
arrogant person? I don't know. I have been told by more than a few
people quite the opposite - that I am too reticent, not "tooting my
own horn," and generally having too low a self esteem to properly put
myself forward. Probably the truth is somewhere in the
middle. Throughout life, I've thought of myself as basically decent,
but probably less likeable than your typical guy. But if I were all
that bad, I'm not sure people would been telling me to assert myself,
rather than the opposite.

So when I hear the word arrogant, I always think of my own personal
experience, and wonder - does this accusation say more about the
speaker than about the person spoken about?

Part of this is I'm really not attuned toward arrogance, unless I see
actual harm. Meanwhile, I can't stand backbiting by others (though I
slip myself). Unless someone exhibits pure horrible behavior, I have a
hard time disliking someone. So I usually don't reach for the word
"arrogant" when I think of words for describing someone. And when I
have heard someone or a class of people referred to as arrogant, I
have a hard time undeerstanding, Instead, when I hear the word
"arrogant" used, it usually seems like the speaker is really saying
"how dare this person make me feel bad about mysef."

Unfortunately, I have yet to see
someone complain about an arrogant person who isn't themself
overinvested in protecting their own ego or overly concerned with
pretend offences against one's misplaced sense of honor.

It's a bit like the complaint I hear about others who are said to be
"smug." Both terms are ostensibly about the person it's directed to,
but in reality are completely about the way it makes someone else
feel, intentionally or not. I so often hear the way the term
"self-righteous" is also used - not because the person is really
self-righteous, but simply has committed the offense of having one's
act together, morally speaking. Vegetarian? Smug. Environmentalist?
Self-righteous. Religious?  Smug. Why? "How dare you behave in a moral
fashion and make-me look bad!!" The term "smug" is right up there with
"virtue signaling."  Virtue signaling is a term I've voided elsewhere;
I doubt it I doubt it really exists, but when I hear the term used, it
just reminds me that some writers enjoy taking offense at moral
behavior that is generally prized in well-functioning societies. This
offense is usually because seeing true moral behavior undermines
self-service cherished beliefs held by some that everyone's just a
b@stard underneath.

So why write about this? Am I just venting?

We've been told that somehow recent anti-democratic and illiberal
movements are a result of "arrogance" by "the elites." When you
investigate, it turns out "the elites" people are said to be
complaining about aren't the people who actually run the country or
businesses; no, no, it seems the problem in over their heds with fury
have no problems with ACTUAL elites who, you know, have actual CONTROL
over our nation's economic framework or government direction. Rather,
the anger is directed at the ten or fifteen percent of of the
population who had the wherewithal to get graduate degrees or have
some sort of "middle-class" profession. Or us big-city dwellers with
our lattes and Priuses and fancy jazz and public transportation and
_books_ ewwq. THOSE are the people that are arrogant.

Why are these
"smug" folk viewed as arrogant? What behaviors do they exhibit?

Wellllll... you have a difficulty getting these people to point to,
um, actual _behaviors_.

But you'll get reasons aplenty. Just not ones based on
behavior. Instead, you'll hear about "attitude," meaning someone is
talking about how someone makes them feel, not about actual
behavior. You'll get a steady drip drip drip whine about how
"political correctness" is ruining the country because no one has the
patience to listen to discredited theories about racial hierarchies,
or how you can't tell rascist jokes anymore becuase "nobody has a
sense of humor." Move past this and you'll get other matters having
nothing to do with people at all, but where they live: e.g. complaints
about "big city values" and not being able to feel safe in the
city. Or, you'll get anger about "attitude" of big city folk - but try
to find who they're angry at, and it's either a Hollywood actor or
someone in the media, which is not a realistic stand-in for a typical
degree-holding city-dweller.  Again, none of these point to
correctable behaviors exhibited by nonfictional people. So what is the
actual beef?

I think it's this: people in cities make more money than people who
don't. That makes people who don't live in cities really unhappy. But
it isn't the money itself - it's the fact that it isn't the other way
around. Why?

Because it wasn't supposed to be this way.

I grew up in suburban
Louisville, Kentucky in the seventies. Obviously, this wasn't exactly
rural. It was in what I later learned was a "white flight"
neighborhood - full of people who had been German and Irish immigrants
who fled the arrival of African Americans coming in from the
country. Naturally, because our neighborhood was segregated, race was
never discussed, aside from this arms-length horse-manure of "that
neighborhood was great, until **they** moved in and ruined it for
everyone" or "*they* should take care of their own problems," where
"they" were never defined (fortunately, I never heard this nonsense
coming out of my parents' mouths). But all of this commentary was an
aside; in hindsight, what these suburbs were really full of, it
seemed, was people who just did not like the cities. The casual racism
was just the icing on the cake. The suburbs were really what they
wanted; they liked their (relatively) big yard and their subsidized
low tax base, being, as most suburbs were, in an unincorporated area
outside of the city. They liked good paying jobs of the cities,
without having to take a streetcar and live in multiunit housing. They
liked not having to compete for housing with poor people fleeing rural
poverty.

And nobody can blame them for that. I myself live in a suburb. The
mecca were the suburbs in middle American cities, where the suburban
lifestyle was set up as the ideal and the cities built themselves
around it.

But about the cities themselves? Particularly the big ones on the east coast? The unspoken assumption was All Those
Big Cities Are Doomed.

We could all hear our older relatives talk about how everything in the
cities was going down the tubes, about crime being out of control and
businesses moving out to the suburbs where the "real people" were. The
cold war just fed into this, as everyone was convinced that all the
big cities would one day be "nuked," leaving nothing but "real
Americans" in charge. This talk was fed by our neighbors from the
country who went to Baptist churches and read nonsense like _The Late,
Great Planet Earth_, which presumed that all cities would be destoyed
with hellfire of atomic oblivion.

And cities like New York? Forget it! They were dooooomed!!! What with
the out of control crime and taxes, everyone regarded John Carpenter's
_Escape from New York_ as if it were a documentary.

When Reagan became president, this sort of thinking became ratified in
most neighbor's heads; it was not just a matter of biblical prophecy,
but seemed an inescapable economic certainty. Jobs would abandon the
heavily-unionized areas in the north; the cities would wither away;
everyone with a brain would move to a low tax state into a suburb with
a nonexistent town center, leaving the ungrateful "poors" to fend for
themselves. Rural areas, too, would benefit, due to the innate
goodness of their citizens. Meanwhile, New York?  California?
"Taxechusettes"? All doomed; all would see their cities shrivel and
die; their grand universities abandoned by those who discovered that a
"good education" could be had at a state university that taught job
skills and otherwise had a good football program.

The events of the last forty years have been exceedingly unkind to
those beliefs.

That is where the charge of "arrogance" comes in. Instead of seeing
their fantasies play out, the white-flight residents of middle America
have been treated to something of a horror show. They've sat watching
the future helplessly, as the least popular kids in grammar school
went off to some pointy-headed college, the ones who were supposed to
be _the losers_, moved to someplace like New York or Raleigh or Austin
and make a boatload of money. Wannna make a boatload of money
yourself? Remeber all those cities that they said would burn in
hellfire? New York? San Francisco?  Boston?  They're right up at the
top. Meanwhile, all those cities you read about for years as being
"good for business"? The smaller, low-tax, midmarket cities with the
big sprawling suburbs?  Well, they're nice. But you had to be lucky
with your pick - only certain citied thrived. Others have stagnated
for twenty years. In any event, you won't make much money from the
capital gains profit from buying a house 30 years ago in the suburbs
of a midmarket city. You won't retire on it. Meanwhile, what about
those immigrants who moved into neighborhoods of Bronx, Queens and
Brooklyn that looked bombed out in the '80s and had the wherewithal to
buy property? They're all millionares!

It turns out forty years of ill will toward the inhabitants of big
cities didn't do a damned thing. So that's why city dwellers are
arrogant. Not because we go around telling people how to live their
life. It's because _we_ were supposed to be the losers.
