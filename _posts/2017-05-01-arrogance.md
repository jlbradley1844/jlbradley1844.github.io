ar·ro·gant
[ˈerəɡənt]

ADJECTIVE
having or revealing an exaggerated sense of one's own importance or abilities

Let's take the above word. Supposing someone beliefs that people of a
certain culture are arrogant. There are actually two ways one can
"earn" the moniker arrogant:

1. Actually reveal an exaggerated sense of importance or abilities due
to claimed beliefs or thoughts.

2. Reveal *any* sense of importance  or confidence in one's opinion to
one who is trained to disregard or think of you as beneath him.

Definition #2 is not the dictionary definition, but I seem to se it
used a whole lot.

Of course, I've been called arrogant a time or two. This is in spite
of having been counseled numerous times by others as being too
reticent, not "tooting my own horn," and generally having too low a
self esteem to properly put myself forward. Through life I get the
feeling I'm less likeable than your typical guy - but honestly, if I
were that bad, I'm not sure people would been telling me to assert
myself, rather than the opposite. So when I hear the word arrogant, I
generally think of it as term that says more about the speaker than
about the person spoken about.

Part of this is I don't really see arrogance, unless I see actual
inconvenience inflicted on the part of another. Partnly I can't stand
backbiting, though I slip myself. Unless someone exhibits pure
horrible behavior, I have a hard time disliking someone. So I usually
don't reach for the word "arrogant" when I think of words for
describing someone. But part of it is because arrogant is often a
shorthand for "how dare this person make me feel bad about mysef." I
have yet to see someone complain about an arrogant person who themself
overinvested in protecting their own ego. It's a bit like the
complaint about someone being "smug." I so often hear it applied to
someone who isn't self-rightesion actually self-righteous, but simply
has committed the "offense" of having one's act together, morally
speaking. Vegetarian?  Smug. Environmentalist?  Smug. Religious?
Smug. Why? "How dare you behave in a moral fashion and make-me look
bad!!" The term "smug" is right up there with "virtue signaling," an
imaginary offense taken at someone for being a decent person.  "That's
just virtue signaling, she wants others to think of her as a good
person. She's a b@stard like all the rest."

So why write about this?

We've been told that somehow recent anti-democratic and illiberal
movements are a result of "arrogance" by "the elites." Us big-city
dwellers with our lattes and Priuses and fancy jazz. When you dig in,
"the elites" they are complaining about aren't the people who actually
run the country or businesses; no, no, it seems the problem in over
their heds with fury have no problems with ACTUAL elites who, you
know, might have CONTROL over social direction. Rather, the anger is
directed at the ten or fifteen percent of of the population who had
the wherewithal to get graduate degrees or have some sort of
"middle-class" profession. THOSE are the people that are arrogant. Why
are these "smug" (again) folk viewed as arrogant? What behaviors do
they exhibit? Wellllll... you have a difficulty getting these people
to point to, um, actual _behaviors_. The ones that might be amenable
to change, so that people would let it go. That would be useful, right?

You'll still get reasons, just not ones based on behavior. More or
less about "attitude," which says how you feel about someone, not how
that person is. You'll also get a steady drip drip drip whine about
"political correctness" is ruining the country because no one will
listen to badly thought out theories you got from your grandpa about
how the world works, or how you can't tell rascist jokes anymore
becuase "nobody has a sense of humor." Move past the thin gruel of
complains about intolerance for thinly-veiled racism and you'll get to
the other matter: complaints about "big city values" and not being
able to feel safe in the city. Again, neither of these point to
correctable behaviors. Or, you'll get anger about "attitude" of big
city folk - but try to find who they're angry at, and it's either a
Hollywood actor or someone in the media, which is not a realistic
stand-in for a typical degree-holding city-dweller.

No, here's the real beef: people in cities make more money than people who
don't. That makes people who don't live in cities really unhappy.

You see, it wasn't supposed to be this way.  I grew up in suburban
Louisville, Kentucky. Obviously, it was close to a city - this was
suburban. It was in what I later learned was a "white flight"
neighborhood - full of people who had been German and Irish immigrants
who fled the arrival of African Americans coming in from the
country. Naturally, because our neighborhood was segregated, race was
never discussed, aside from this arms-length horse-manure of "that
neighborhood was great, until the bl**ks moved in and ruined it for
everyone." Or you get "they should take care of their own problems,"
never specifying who "they" were, and what "their own problems"
were. Fortunately, I never heard that from my parents. But all of this
commentary was an aside; in hindsight, what these suburbs were really
full of, it seemed, was people who just did not like the cities. They
liked their (relatively) big yard and their subsidized low tax base,
being, as most suburbs were, in an unincorporated area outside of the
city. They liked good paying jobs of the cities, without having to
take a streetcar and live in multiunit housing. They liked not having
to compete for housing with poor people fleeing rural poverty. And
nobody can blame them for that.

But about the cities? The unspoken assumption was All Those Big Cities
Are Doomed.

We could all hear our older relatives talk about how everything in the
cities was going down the tubes, about crime being out of control and
businesses moving out to the suburbs where the "real people" were. The
cold war just fed into this, as everyone was convinced that all the
big cities would one day be "nuked," leaving nothing but "real
Americans" in charge. This talk was fed by our neighbors from the
country who went to Baptist churches and read nonsense like _The Late,
Great Planet Earth_, which presumed that all cities would be destoyed
with hellfire of atomic oblivion. (Apparently, it was ok to work in the
city, but so long as you lived outside the dotted line on the map
indicating where the city line was you would be safe? Was that the
idea?)

And cities like New York? Forget it! They were dooooomed!!! What with
the out of control crime and taxes, everyone regarded John Carpenter's
_Escape from New York_ as if it were a documentary.

When Reagan became president, this sort of thinking became ratified in
most neighbor's heads; it was not just a matter of biblical prophecy, but
seemed an inescapable economic certainty. Jobs would abandoned
the heavily-unionized areas in the north, the cities would wither
away, everyone with a brain would move to a low tax state into a
suburb with a nonexistent town center, leaving the ungrateful "poors"
to fend for themselves. Rural areas, too, would benefit, due to the
innate goodness of their citizens. Meanwhile, New York?  California?
"Taxechusettes"? All doomed; all would see their cities wither and
die; their grand universities abandoned by those who discovered what a
real "good education" looked like.

The events of the last forty years have been exceedingly unkind to
those beliefs.

That is where the charge of "arrogance" comes in. Instead of seeing
their fantasies play out, the white-flight residents of middle America
have been treated to something of a horror show. They've sat watching
the future helplessly, as the least popular kids in grammar school
went off to college moved to someplace like New York or Raleigh or
Austin and make a boatload of money. Wannna make a boatload of money?
Remeber all those cities that they said would burn in hellfire? New
York? San Francisco? Boston?  They're right up at the top. Meanwhile,
all those cities you read about for years as being "good for
business"? The smaller, low-tax, midmarket cities? Well, they're
nice. But you had to pick lucky - only certain citied thrived. Others
have done ok, but you aren't going to be able to sell a house you
bought 30 years ago for a huge profit. Meanwhile, what about those
immigrants who moved into areas of Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn that
looked bombed out in the eighties and had the wherewithal to buy
property? Some of them are millionars now!

It turns out forty years of ill will toward the inhabitants of big
cities didn't do a damned thing. So that's why city dwellers are
arrogant. Not because we go around telling people how to live their
life. It's because _we_ were supposed to be the losers.
