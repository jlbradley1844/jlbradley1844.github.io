## Closed Communities and Their Enemies

Is there any word more homespun and apple-pie than community?

Today's society, particularly the urban societies most live in, is
individualistic. So it is unsurprising that the world "community" takes on a
particularly warm glow. It may even be a nostalgic glow - thinking of
bygone close-knit villages, or of established civic and church
organizations of long ago. Those who grew up in small, close-knit
communities where they were on the outside, due to religious beliefs,
race, sexual preference or otherwise, may not have the sort of postive
beliefs about said communities. But these are the exceptions.

Indeed, perhaps about 20-25 years ago, there was a movement afoot
called "Communitarianism." The goal, both socially and politically,
was to reintroduce the sense of civic involvement and responsibility
that were missing in much of American life. Online quizzes would show
whether or not you were a communitarian or not. Meanwhile, books like
Robert Putnam's _Bowling Alone_ noted the decline in civic
organization and community life in America and worried about the
effects it would have on respect for civic institutions, government
and respect for democratic norms. The idea was that too much
individualism resulted in the loss of civic life that contributed so
much to American society.

Such worries have a real foundation. A distinct lack of community and
belonging is noted in many of the classes that have formed the primary
backbown of resurgent alt-right groups and the associated decline for
respect of democratic institions and liberal values such as freedom of
the press. Notably, alt-right membership is associated with lack of
belonging an anoemie, particularly in well-educated but unsuccessful
subgroups in society disconnected from normal communities. Such people
may cling very strongly to a "Christian" identity, but rarely, if ever
go to church. Indeed, one of the strongest predictors of whether
someone voted for the current President in the Republican primary was
if someone strongly identified themselves as "Christian" or
"Evangelical" but never themselves went to church.

Meanwhile, Baha'i writings such as _Century of Light_ identify
excessive individualism as both a hallmark and a problem of current
Western society. Part of this is from a moral point of view - someone
who is individualist is likely to think of their needs first, and of
the needs of others conditionally if at all. But there is also a
respect for communities as a requirement of civic involvement.

However, the type of community is quite critical. I'll identify two
sorts of communities - "open" communities and "closed" communities. It
turns out "open" communities are vital and critical. The most critical
ones are the cosmopolitan, open communities, and are particulary the
only long-lived such communities. "Closed" communities, themselves,
are more popular, but their excesses are themselves responsible for
individualism. Historically, the first open communities have been the
"universal" religious communities, which themselves formed the
elements for the propagation and maintenance of democratic and liberal
(in the philosophical sense) values. The decline of such values is the
direct cause of the the current problems of today.

-------------------------------

Throughout much of human history, mankind lived in closed
communities. This was of necessity. Much has been written about this -
the first hunter gatherer tribes of were of 100-200 people. The
ability to coordinate so many people, made possible with our large
forebrains, were responsible for putting Homo Sapiens on top of the
food chain. Long before we had built formidable tools, our ability to
cooperate in a complicated fashion put us on to of the "food chain,"
and outside of Africa, where animals co-evolved alongside primates, as
soon as people moved into the area they quickly depopulated all major
megafauna through this ability.

Indeed, much of what we might call "common-sense" morality results
from our ability to work within these small-knit communities in close
cooperation. The first true cities did not occur until perhaps ten
thousand years ago; if any evolutionary pressures existed, it happened
well before that time. And most people continued to live in small
villages of relatively similar size until perhaps two hundred years
ago. By that time, we, humankind, have evolved to work in small
groups. This means a particulr sense of community that goes with
it. Some of the "natural" morals of this include:

* Fairness: a necessity when you think of the need to work together
  while penalizing free riders. This is similar to justice but less
  abstract; it works on the basis of reciprocity.
  
* Honor: attempts to work on behalf not only of a community, but your
  family within the community, since if your family is dishonored they
  risked expulsion from the community.

* Loyalty: if someone is in the community, you need to work on his or
  her behalf even though you may not particularly like him or her.

* Trustworthiness/Reliability: community members should be able to
  count on you.

* Respect: giving someone the honor deserved based on contributions to
  the group as a whole.

If you are a secular - and particular if you are a "naturalist" - you
will think this is the end of the story, as far as morals go. This is
what we are bred with, these are the parameters we have to work with,
and we must make the best of it. Indeed, if you pick up a book on
morality by an atheist, this is the sort of wisdom that passes for
morality, a "just so" story about how humans are social animals that
are born good because of evolutionary forces that determined our
cooperative nature.

I am referring to these as "closed communities" because of the
particular moral calculations that go on in these communities. Closed
communities presume not that the flow of community members is fixed,
but that it is slow. You have time to adjust to the presence of each
other and judge character. Take, for example, a sociopath. In ancient
societies, there was no law enforcement to speak of; no rules of
evidence or the like. Justice would be meted out based on one word
against another. It would seem to be an ideal place for a
sociopath. Why, then, wasn't sociopathy an evolutionary advantage? Why
aren't we all sociopaths?  Because the closed nature of these
communities were a valuable protection. Strangers are slowly accepted
and carefully watched in the community, and given that the same people
work alongside the sociopath, eventually the trail of lies leads to
serious problems. This is one reason psychologists believe humans are
so unforgiving of lies, even though they do it all the time and
frequently catch friends doing it. Closed communities and our own
natural instincts kept the truly amoral in line, ensuring that somone
harmful who pushed their luck was one ambush away from an unnatural death.

So we have been bred for a very practical, useful form of morality. To
some extent, the seculars are right that humans have a very useful
sense of right and wrong. Where this goes horribly wrong is with the
presumption that the the basis of modern liberalism can be supported
by this natural morality. Modern liberalism and survival in a huge
open society requires virtues that are not naturally present inside
humans. This is why threats to liberal governments by authoritarian
movements seem to be a recurrent theme of such liberal movements. In
short, there are a set of virtues which are NOT present naturally with
respect to small communities, and would not have been rewarded from an
evolutionary point of view. Yet we still treat these as virtues. Where
did these come?

--------------------------------

Let's start with the beginning of "civilizaton."

------------------------------

Likewise, it isn't just liberalism that comes from virtues that aren't
naturally present. Our current economy is an innovation that is made
possible by our ability to exchange fairly and expect fairness from
people we don't know. This, again, is not something that would have
been a virtue present from evolution.

Let's go back a few hundred years ago when human populations slowly
began to shift into cities. This is the time when another shift
occurred in our economic life.

Today, virtually everything works in a marketplace. Indeed, the entire
world economy as a whole works as a unified, single marketplace. The
shift to paper money and the invention of double-ledger bookeeping is
usually thought of as the technological prime driver which allowed
this move. And before that, there was "hard currency" minted by the
government, and this allowed some of the efficiencies necessary for a
marketplace; even the most ancient civilizations used hard
currency. But prior to paper money, the bulk of humanity, not
connected with the cities or the elites in government, generally
lacked hard money. What did they do before then?

The common-sense presumption is that before then, everyone must've
traded via barter - a ludicrously inefficient mechanism. Friedman's
famous experiments had shown that even in primitive cultures, there
were marketplaces that exchanged goods, and barter was a necessity for
commerce. His thesis was that markets and exchange were natural, and
that there has never been a human society, no matter how primitive,
that did not invent the equivalent of a marketplace.

While the narrative of marketplaces has truth, the belief that this
was siginificant due to its existence is false. For such societies,
there is no evidence that there was ever an economy where barter was a
significant part of the economy. Throughout much of history, most of
the economy simply wasn't on the marketplace. Marketplaces, far from
being universal cultural drivers, tended to be very small, minor
affairs - something one did in the little free time when one could go
into the village, for socialiation as much as anything else. The
problem with such marketplaces is simple - people generally trade from
surplus, and in an agricultural community, where skills are generally
similar and growth cycles are identical, people tend to run surpluses
in the same sort of things. There was of course some specialization -
skilled craftsmen and the like - primarily applying to the relative
handful of people who actually lived in larger towns and cities. But
those were the same people that had access to hard currency. No, the
bulk of people made to without a formal commerce. And they had to do
it without barter. What, then, did they do?

This is where our natural, community-based morals come in. Let me
introduce you to something called "The Gift Economy."

In a gift economy, people generally give of their surplus without an
immediate payment expected in return. But of course, sometimes they
need to receive. How does this work? It would seem that you would have
a really bad problem with free-riders. Well, you would, but you have
to remember these critical things:

- Everyone lived in small communities
- You saw everyone else on a day to day basis
- And people have certain moral instincts that act within the context
of such communities.

Keeping these things in mind, how do you think people worked? Well,
they expected to get paid back, of course! And if you received, you'd
know you were on the receiving end and would instinctually feel guilty
if you didn't return the favor eventually somehow. And you also knew,
generally, what something is worth. If someone gave you eggs when
everyone was running a surplus, you were polite and might give them
something back that you didn't need, and that would be the end of
it. But if in the middle of a famine, your neighbor gave you eggs and
kept your children from starving, you knew you owed her _BIG TIME_. And
If you attempted to settle the score with something large, she
may protest, but she wouldn't be surprised, and she would may not feel
the need to to give additional gifts to settle the acocunt,
particularly if it was a sacrifice on her part.

This still happens all the time, in areas where one generally doesn't
pay for things. Think of the professions where you're expected to get
things done through a large network of colleagues - skilled
people-professions like sales, marketing and business development,
where everyone have extensive rolodexes, networks frequently and are
constently calling on one another to give or offer favors. Indeed, it
works in any professional field. And the thing that makes it work are
the bounds of community. Why? Because it ensures everyone is
contributing to at least some extent.

But just as community-based morals don't easily "scale up" to a larger
society, even community-based economy doesn't "scale up." Paper money
in particular depends upon you trusting a "system," since the paper
itself isn't worth anything - a system entirely outside of the
community. But in general, trade using money with strangers is not as
foolproof as one ordinarily beliefs - cosmopolitan cities are full of
outsiders and they will take advantage of you. Remember the techniques
the closed communities used to protect themselves from sociopaths and
the amoral? Paper money allows you to keep score effectively, but
that's about it. Fraud would seem to be the rule rather than the
exception. Yet somehow cities and towns flourished. What made it
possible? New values and morals. Again, these values and morals had to
take place isolated from the reciprocity that defined th eearly closed
communities.

=======================

A word about "the gift community" and its limitations. When the fact
of the existence of a primitive "gift economy" is recounted to people,
particularly those who are religious, this is generally regarded as
heartwarming. I know, because where I've heard it, it was from
religious leaders describing it in exactly those terms. This was seen
as an improvement on our modern, stonehearted world of cold cash, where
things like relationships really counted. Somehow, this is seen as
more moral.

This is entirely misleading. The gift economy is _not_ to be confused
with charity. The gift economy is not concerned about giving without
giving without getting something back. You are expecting something
back - it's an exchange! If this is how the "usual case" operates but
people are still of a charitable nature, then this is all
great. Otherwise, this can present clear limitations when attempting
to "scale up" to larger communities. Think about these situations:

* A stranger wandering through the village will find it difficult to
  get hospitality. Without hard cash, they will not be able to pay for
  lodging, and they will not be in town long enough to return the
  favor, so people will be reluctant to lend a hand.

* Those that are disfavored by the community, perhaps as a result of
  not "fitting in" religiously or ethnically, will be at a
  disadvantage. Many will not exchange with such people, or when they
  do, it will be at a disadvantage or no favor will be returned.

Do these seem trivial? Here's a more realistic, unfortunate scenaro,
involving a mismatch between a market economy and the closed-community
gift economy:

An African-Americal walks to the counter of the Woolworth's in
Virginia in the early 20th century. He slaps down some money and
attempts to order a drink. The person behind the counter says "Sorry,
your money's no good here." What just happened?  That cleark is opting
out of the market economy and using the economy of the community. In
that economy, any exchange is regarded in the context of a transaction
within a community. Exchange is a favor between those within the
community. Contrariwise, one does not to business with one who is
outside of the community. The clerk is signalling that the potential
customer is not a part of the community and not worthy of entering
into an exchange. The
clerk is also signaling to other white community members who are
present that he will maintain exclusivity to this community - a gift,
of a sorts, to other whites, to let them know the hospitality of the
business is a privelege to be shared only with them.

This behavior is entirely in keeping with community morals. The
community values its exclusivity, being that there are benefits being
able to exchange goods and services almost anyone in the community of
any means. Meanwhile, the African-American is from a community who
cannot be expected to contribute anything monetarily. In the logic
of the closed community, it is "moral." It is also entirely immoral by
any other measure. Indeed, this is one case where justice would have
been served best by unfettered capitalism. You are in a rough
situation, morally, if someone who says "I'll take any money, as
long as it's green" behaves more morally than you.

Now, let's go back to the larger cities, of, say, the past two
thousand years. This sort of attitude would not work. Certainly, hard
money was the critical issue, since you needed to exchange with all
sorts of outsiders. Certainly, there were others in the city excluded
from economic life - such as the residents of Jewish ghettos, where
Jews traded among themselves not so much out of preference as
necessity, due to exclusion by the Christian community. But in
general, in the cities, hard money was going to be used and
offered. So there is a conundrum - is hard currency itself going to be
sufficient to allow cities to work? Hard money is no magic solution to
fraud; neither are armed guards. There needs to be some sort of
additional mechanism to ensure that people are honest and treat each
other fairly despite not being within the same community.  Wouldn't
humans be morally incapable of living in cities? Wouldn't our clannish
nature gradually overtake our economic incentive to do so?

Something else is necessary. Given that "natural" morals are built for
survival in small communities, one would think that this would be an
unsustainable transfer. It would certainly seem that whatever morals
we had evolved would not work when going from a society of a few
hundred people seen throughout our lives to one where thousands of
strangers could conceivably be encountered in a day. Aside from money,
there was one missing piece that allowed everything to work: other
virtues.

These new virtues have allowed us to work together and these are
instructive and should be studied. Indeed, any population that was
able to do so would be rewarded with a more prosperous community, both
economically, and technologically. At this point, one of the
challenges is coping with the fact much as industrialization has
forced people to adopt new moral codes to work and cooperate with
people outside of our city, we need new moral codes to work with
humans on a global scale. Yet where will these come from?  The answer
is the same as it was for the morals necessary to live in the cities.

-----------------------------

To live in cosmopolitan society, one needs a set of what I would call
"cosmopolitan virtues." These are virtues not present in
community-based virtues. Some of these would include the following:

* Justice and evenhandness: giving each his or her due reward,
  regardless of community membership.

* Compassion: ability to feel for others regardless of situation.

* Tolerance: ability to work with others from outside of what you feel
  is your own community.

* Idealism: recognition that there the right life is not defined by
  the community but by things outside of the community.

* Charity and kindness: ability to give to others (in the sense of
  gift economy) even though one is unlikely to be paid back.

Where did these come from? The mere fact that this is a Baha'i
telegraphs my thoughts on the matter.

Throughout much of history, there was not a concept of something
called a "religion." Or rather, it wasn't a distinct thing. You were
in a community, your community had beliefs about morals and religious
things, and that was that. Community itself was bound up in religion
and vice versa. If you go study the religions practiced about three
thousand years ago, this is evident. The reification of the concept of
"a religion" separate from the ethnic community that practiced it was
not even defined until several centuries ago - before then, if you
didn't adhere to the religion of the community, you were a pagan and/or an
infidel and that was that.

However, there were major developments, starting around 3000 years
ago, that changed this. Spiritual ferment, happening in different
places and in different times, produced three major religious
movements, whose ramafications spread throughout a wide radius through
what was then the "civilized world" of Asia,
Europe and North Africa:
*Buddhism
*Christianity
*Islam

These three world religions, little noticed at the time of their
founding, spread across the globe so completely that by 1000 AD, there was
practically no area in Europe, Asia or North Africa that was not fully
under the sway of one of these religions. Unlike earlier religions, they
were not married to a community, culture or even a nation: they
presented themselves as universal, cosmopolitan religions, fit for any
believer willing to believe.

In roughly the same timeframe, other religions saw dramatic reformation
efforts which made them more universal in scope. In India, works like
_The Upanishads_ made it possible to talk about the many flavors of
Hinduism as a single faith. And as for Judaism, prior to the "Jesus
movement," Judaism had spread throughout various Greek communities
independent of claimed Israeli nationality, and the Jewish reformation
efforts after the destruction of the temple in the first centry AD
made it possible to think of a Jewish religion independent of the
Jewish people. As a result, the concept of "religion" as a standalone
entity was finally possible.

Note that this formulation is in terms of a Baha'i cosmology;
e.g. spiritual progression as a cycle of revelation. There have been
other religious writers that have made similar discoveries; e.g. the
proposed "Axial Age" of Karl Jaspers, popularized through writings
such as Karen Armstrong's _The Great Transformation_. From a Baha'i
point of view, the distinctions between a so-called axial age and the
manifestations are a bit of a "poTAYto / poTAHto" distinction - you
don't have one without the other. The important thing about this is
that all of these universal religious placed a novel emphasis on the
"cosmopolitan" virtues - and reformations in Judaism, Zoriastrianism,
Hinduism, Jainism and Chinese thought (Confucianism and Taoism) made
it possible to think in terms of new moral virtues that made life within
and across entire civilizations possible.

From a secular point of view, this would seem to be simply an
adaptation to changing points of view. Yet this presumes that this
would have happened without these spiritual movements. Of the secular
movements to occur in the axial age, perhaps the Greek and Roman
philosophical movements are the most significant. Yet it took Muslim
and Christian philosophers and scholars to spread and popularize their
thought beyond their original matrix in Greek cultural life. To go to
a purely secular thought system to revolutionize moral thought, you
have to go forward to the liberalism of the enlightenment - and that
was originally rooted in Christianity as well.

Where does that take us? Where that takes us is that the "instinctual"
morality that we share as a human race is a decidedly incomplete moral
birthright. It grants us the ability to act thoughtful to friends and
family. Yet it seems to guarantee a state of prepetual conflict
of one sort or other between communities. To get along in cities and
to get along between communities and nations requires the unity that
only more cosmopolitan virtues can give us. Western liberal thought
has attempted to be that universal value, but unfortunately has proven
too brittle. In short, it can change some people, but it leaves us
with the push and pull of cosmopolitanism versus community.

---------------------------

Of course, I am omitting one stage in our evolution - from about
10,000 years ago to about 2,000 years ago. During this stage, the
first river civilizations formed, followed by the Great Civilizations
of the ancient world. I have said that humans had morals on the tribal
level that, to some extent, may be instinctual. The purpose of this
was to allow exchange within and between tribes on the basis of a gift
economy, ensure balance and harmony within the tribe, and deal with
moral incompetents who might endanger the tribe members. And during
the period of the ancient great civilizations - prior to the rise of
the universal religions - a lot of people still lived within these
tribes, outside of the civilizations. Yet the ancient "river
civilizations" began to flourish - the Fertile Crescent, the Indus
Valley, the Mayans, ancient China, and so forth. These were large
enough that the unit of the community did not hold. And there was a
need to suppor the central authorities and the first large cities that
served as centers of these civilizations.

Yet from the point of view of tribal morals, there was no
backing. Take the patchwork of tribes that may have lived over a
region. Within the region, there may be a shifting set of alliances
between tribes, as relationships between tribes were managed much as
relationships between people within a tribe - a balance of exchange
and tributes to keep the peace. Yet obviously there was the possiblity
of open warfare between tribes. And there was certainly no need to
divert resources to a central authority. How was that resolved?

The civlizations began with the concept of the _hierarchy_. 
There were innovations that were needed to prop up these
civilizations. The invention of hard currency was one. That allowed
commerce to move freely. The empire could use that to force exchange
and eliminate the friction imposed by the old balance of gifts between
communities that used to power economies.

However, another innovation was moral. The old tribes had to have a
mechanism for extending the community, and religion was one element in
it. And religions began to reflect the larger communities within which
it had to operate. This was
theme of a book published some time ago: Eve Einsler's _The Chalice
and The Blade. A religion for the wider community had to support the
wider community.

There is one such religion everyone knows (or claims to know)
something about. It was of a small civilization - how large it is not
even historians yet know. They have not found ruins of its old
capital, making it impossible to verify the size of this civilization,
or the date of its founding. Yet we have a record, unverified, of its
history. This is the ancient religion of Moses, as documented in the
Torah. Now, let it be known that the religion we now call Judaism did
not exist in the time the Israeli tribes - Judaism is very much a
product of the Roman-era reformations. However, one must acknowledge
the generalities we do know about this ancient religion - let's just
call it the "Israeli" religion. The Torah gives us a valuable window
into the culture of a religion spanning multiple communities - "the
twelve tribes" in this case. Here, we have a community that is too
small to be an empire run on tribute, but distinctive enough and large
enough to have been to large to be run on the basis of tribal units.

Along with this larger community, we have - no surprise - its own
religion. Unlike the older communities, we cannot count on knowing
anyone around. So how do we work around this? Well, the future
nation-builders had the tools of culture at its disposal, with all
that this implies - founding myths of its creation and nationhood;
explanations of how it came to be and relation to its larger
neighbors; arts and culture distinctive to its own nation; and
finally, its own religion.

Indeed, all of these communities had their own religions. They may
have varied much in the details; they would hardly be recognizeable
for their polytheism (a multiplicity that may have even come about
from the union of many tribes). However, as discussed in _The Chalice
and The Blade_, there are a number of moral virtues which are
elevated:

* Respect for Authority - The need for central command and respect for
  hierarchy was an important one. Without that respect 

* Obedience

* Patriotism

* Respect for the community

* Refinement/Cleanliness

* Truthfulness

Most people with knowledge of the Bible can see some of this implied
in the books. In particular, the Old Testament gives an account of a
community under strict moral code. While this may be the basis of our
modern society so frequently claimed in the West, it is a very limited
one - in that it is very plain the religion of _a community_. Indeed,
the nearby Samaritans, a community of very similar beliefs, were not
thought of as fellow Jews, and were thought of as having completely
different communities and religions in spite of having very similar
holy scriptures. These religions were **not** intended for outside the
community. Indeed, the Israeli God was not claimed to be the only God,
so technically it was not even monotheistic - it was simply claimed to
be The Greatest. From that point of view then, the focus on idolatry
was an effort to keep Israelis from adopting polytheistic practices of
neighbors.

Note that unlike the "community-based" virtues, these are not endemic
to people naturally. They have to be taught, to some extent. This is
why, unlike some of the other virtues, many of these seem less
important nowadays - indeed are rebelled against. Yet we would not be
able to organize ourselves into large communities without adherence to
them. Without adherence to them by the broad base of the population,
even a workable middle-sized city would prove impossible to manage.

----------------------------

So what can be done? well, the answers are already there. The great
religious leap forward is what one might call an "open community."
That is, a community that one can join and leave without
will. This idea of the open community and the virtues that defined it
are one of the great innovations of the universal religions.
