Is there any word more homespun and apple-pie than community?

Today's society, particularly the urban societies most live in, is
individualistic. So it is unsurprising that the world "community" takes on a
particularly warm glow. It may even be a nostalgic glow - thinking of
bygone close-knit villages, or of established civic and church
organizations of long ago. Those who grew up in small, close-knit
communities where they were on the outside, due to religious beliefs,
race, sexual preference or otherwise, may not have the sort of postive
beliefs about said communities. But these are the exceptions.

Indeed, perhaps about 20-25 years ago, there was a movement afoot
called "Communitarianism." The goal, politically, was to reintroduce
the sense of civic involvement and responsibility that were missing in
much of American life. Online quizzes would show whether or not you
were a communitarian or not. Meanwhile, books like Robert Putnam's
_Bowling Alone_ noted the decline in civic organization and community
life in America and worried about the effects it would have on respect
for civic institutions, government and respect for democratic norms.

Such worries have a real foundation. A distinct lack of
community and belonging is noted in many of the classes that have
formed the primary backbown of resurgent alt-right groups and the
associated decline for respect of democratic institions and liberal
values such as freedom of the press. Notably,
alt-right membership is associated with lack of belonging an anoemie,
particularly in well-educated but unsuccessful subgroups in society
disconnected from normal communities. Such people may cling very
strongly to a "Christian" identity, but rarely, if ever go to
church. Indeed, one of the strongest predictors of whether someone voted for
the current President in the Republican primary was if someone
strongly identified themselves as "Christian" or "Evangelical" but
never themselves went to church.

Meanwhile, Baha'i writings such as _Century of Light_ identify
excessive individualism as both a hallmark and a problem of current
Western society. Part of this is from a moral point of view - someone
who is individualist is likely to think of their needs first, and of
the needs of others conditionally if at all. But there is also a
respect for communities as a requirement of civic involvement.

However, the type of community is quite critical. I'll identify two
sorts of communities - "open" communities and "closed" communities. It
turns out "open" communities are vital and critical. The most critical
ones are the cosmopolitan, open communities, and are particulary the
only long-lived such communities. "Closed" communities, themselves,
are more popular, but their excesses are themselves responsible for
individualism. Historically, the first open communities have been the
"universal" religious communities, which themselves formed the
elements for the propagation and maintenance of democratic and liberal
(in the philosophical sense) values. The decline of such values is the
direct cause of the the current problems of today.

-------------------------------

Throughout much of human history, mankind lived in small, closed
communities. This was of necessity. Much has been written about this -
the first hunter gatherer tribes of 100-200 people, made possible with
our large forebrains, were responsible for putting Homo Sapiens on top
of the food chain. Long before we had built formidable tools, our
ability to cooperate in a complicated fashion put us on to of the
"food chain," and outside of Africa, where animals co-evolved
alongside primates, as soon as people moved into the area they quickly
depopulated all major megafauna through this ability.

Indeed, much of what we might call "common-sense" morality results
from our ability to work within these small-knit communities in close
cooperation. The first true cities did not occur until perhaps ten
thousand years ago. And most people continued to live in small
villages of relatively similar size until perhaps two hundred years
ago. By that time, we, humankind, have evolved to work in small
groups. This means a particulr sense of community that goes with
it. Some of the "natural" morals of this include:

* Fairness: a necessity when you think of the need to work together
  while penalizing free riders. This is similar to justice but less
  abstract; it works on the basis of reciprocity.
  
* Honor: attempts to work on behalf not only of a community, but your
  family within the community, since if your family is dishonored they
  risked expulsion from the community.

* Loyalty: if someone is in the community, you need to work on his or
  her behalf even though you may not particularly like him or her.

* Trustworthiness/Reliability: community members should be able to
  count on you.

* Respect: giving someone the honor deserved based on contributions to
  the group as a whole.

If you are a secular - and particular if you are a "naturalist" - you
will think this is the end of the story, as far as morals go. This is
what we are bred with, these are the parameters we have to work with,
and we must make the best of it. Indeed, if you pick up a book on
morality by an atheist, this is the sort of wisdom that passes for
morality, a "just so" story about how humans are social animals that
are born good because of evolutionary forces that determined our
cooperative nature.

I am referring to these as "closed communities" because of the
particular moral calculations that go on in these communities. Closed
communities presume not that the flow of community members is fixed,
but that it is slow. You have time to adjust to the prescense of each
other. Take, for example, as sociopath. In ancient societies, there
was no law enforcement to speak of; no rules of evidence or the
like. Justice would be meted out based on one word against another. It
would seem to be an ideal place for a sociopath. Why, then, wasn't
sociopathy an evolutionary advantage? Why aren't we all sociopaths?
The closed nature of these communities explains as much. Strangers are
slowly accepted and carefully watched in the community, and given that
the same people work alongside the sociopath, eventually the trail of
lies leads to serious problems. This is one reason psychologists think
that people are so unforgiving of lies, even though they do it all the
time and frequently catch friends doing it. Closed communities kept
the truly amoral in line - somone who pushed their luck was one ambush
away from an unnatural death.

So we have been bred for a very practical, useful form of morality. To
some extent, the seculars are right that humans have a very useful
sense of right and wrong. Where this goes horribly wrong is with the
presumption that the the basis of modern liberalism can be supported
by this natural morality. Modern liberalism and survival in a huge
open society requires virtues that are not naturally present inside
humans. This is why threats to liberal governments by authoritarian
movements seem to be a recurrent theme of such liberal movements. In
short, there are a set of virtues which are NOT present naturally with
respect to small communities, and would not have been rewarded from an
evolutionary point of view. Yet we still treat these as virtues. Where
did these come? This is a critical point.

------------------------------

It isn't just liberalism that comes from virtues that aren't naturally
present. Indeed, our current economy is an innovation that is made
possible by our ability to exchange fairly and expect fairness from
people we don't know. This, again, is not something that would have
been a virtue present from evolution.

Let's go back a few hundred years ago when human populations slowly
began to shift into cities. This is the time when another shift
occurred in our economic life.

Today, virtually everything works in a marketplace. Indeed, the entire
world economy as a whole works as a unified, single marketplace. The
shift to paper money a double-book bookeeping is usually thought of as
the technological prime driver which allowed this move. Sure, there
was "hard currency" minted by the government, and this allowed some of
the efficiencies necessary for a marketplace. Even the most ancient
civilizations used hard currency. Indeed, mercantilism -
literally, the drive for hard currency to power the marketplace - was
a primary driver of the first imperialist forays into the new
world. But prior to paper money, the bulk of humanity, not connected
with the cities or the elites in government, generally lacked hard
money.

What did they do before then? The common-sense presumption is that
before then, everyone must've traded via 
barter - a ludicrously inefficient mechanism. Friedman's famous experiments
had shown that even in primitive cultures, there were marketplaces
that exchanged goods, and barter was a necessity for commerce. His
thesis was that markets and exchange were natural, and that there has
never been a human society, no matter how primitive, that did not
invent the equivalent of a marketplace.

While the narrative of marketplaces has truth, the belief that this
was siginificant due to its existence is false. For such societies,
there is no evidence that there was ever an economy where barter was a
significant part of the economy. Throughout much of history, most of
the economy simply wasn't on the marketplace. Marketplaces, far from
being universal cultural drivers, tended to be very small, minor
affairs - something one did in the little free time when one could go
into the village, for socialiation as much as anything else. The
problem with such marketplaces is simple - people generally trade from
surplus, and in an agricultural community, where skills are generally
similar and growth cycles are identical, people tend to run surpluses
in the same sort of things. There was of course some specialization -
skilled craftsmen and the like - primarily applying to the relative
handful of people who actually lived in larger towns and cities. But
those were the same people that had access to hard currency. No, the
bulk of people made to without a formal commerce. And they had to do
it without barter. What, then, did they do?

This is where our natural, community-based morals come in. Let me
introduce you to something called "The Gift Economy."

In a gift economy, people generally give of their surplus without an
immediate payment expected in return. But of course, sometimes they
need to receive. How does this work? It would seem that you would have
a really bad problem with free-riders. Well, you would, but you have
to remember these critical things:

- Everyone lived in small communities
- You saw everyone else on a day to day basis
- And people have certain moral instincts that act within the context
of such communities.

Keeping these things in mind, how do you think people worked? Well,
they expected to get paid back, of course! And if you received, you'd
know you were on the receiving end and would instinctually feel guilty
if you didn't return the favor eventually somehow. And you also knew,
generally, what something is worth. If someone gave you eggs when
everyone was running a surplus, you were polite and might give them
something back that you didn't need, and that would be the end of
it. But if in the middle of a famine, your neighbor gave you eggs and
kept your children from starving, you knew you owed her _BIG TIME_. And
If you attempted to settle the score with something large, she
may protest, but she wouldn't be surprised, and she would may not feel
the need to to give additional gifts to settle the acocunt,
particularly if it was a sacrifice on her part.

This still happens all the time, in areas where one generally doesn't
pay for things. Think of the professions where you're expected to get
things done through a large network of colleagues - skilled
people-professions like sales, marketing and business development,
where everyone have extensive rolodexes, networks frequently and are
constently calling on one another to give or offer favors. Indeed, it
works in any professional field. And the thing that makes it work are
the bounds of community. Why? Because it ensures everyone is
contributing to at least some extent.

When the fact of the existence of a primitive "gift economy" is
recounted to people, particularly those who are religious, this is
generally regarded as heartwarming. I know, because where I've heard
it, it was from religious leaders describing it in exactly those
terms. This was seen as an improvement on our modern, coldhearted
world of cold cash, where things like relationships really
counted. Somehow, this is seen as more moral.

This is entirely misleading. The gift economy is _not_ to be
confused with charity. The gift economy is not concerned about giving
without giving without getting something back. You are, at some level,
expecting something back! If this is how the "usual case" operates but
people are still of a charitable nature, then this is all
great. Otherwise, this can present clear limitations when attempting
to "scale up" to larger communities. Think about these situations:

* A stranger wandering through the village will find it difficult to
  get hospitality. Without hard cash, they will not be able to pay for
  lodging, and they will not be in town long enough to return the
  favor, so people will be reluctant to lend a hand.

* Those that are disfavored by the community, perhaps as a result of
  not "fitting in" religiously or ethnically, will be at a
  disadvantage. Many will not exchange with such people, or when they
  do, it will be at a disadvantage or no favor will be returned.

Do these seem trivial? Here's a more realistic, unfortunate scenaro,
involving a mismatch between a market economy and the closed-community
gift economy:

An African-Americal walks to the counter of
the Woolworth's in Virginia in the early 20th century. He slaps down
some money and attempts to order a drink. The person behind the
counter says "Sorry, your money's no good here." What just happened?
That cleark is opting out of the market economy and using the
economy of the community. In that economy, any exchange is regarded in
the context of a transaction within a community. Exchange is a favor
between those within the community. Contrariwise, one
does not to business with one who is outside of the community. The
clerk is signalling that the potential customer is not a part of the
community and deserves no exchange. The clerk is also signaling to other
white community members who are present that he will maintain
exclusivity to this community - a gift, of a sorts, to other
whites, to let them know the hospitality of the business is a
privelege to be shared only with them.

This behavior is entirely in keeping with community morals. The
community values its exclusivity, being that there are benefits being
able to exchange goods and services almost anyone in the community of
any means. Meanwhile, the African-American is from a community who
cannot be expected to contribute anything besides money. In the logic
of the closed community, it is "moral." It is also entirely immoral by
any other measure. Indeed, this is one case where justice would have
been served best by unfettered capitalism. You are in a rough
situation, morally, if someone who says "I'll take any money, as
long as it's green" behaves more morally than you.

Now, let's go back to the larger cities, of, say, the past two
thousand years. This sort of attitude would not work. Certainly, hard
money was the critical issue, since you needed to exchange with all
sorts of outsiders. Certainly, there were others in the city excluded
from economic life - such as the residents of Jewish
ghettos, where Jews traded among themselves not so much out of
preference as necessity, due to exclusion by the Christian
community. But in general, in the cities, hard money was going to be
used and offered. So there is a conundrum - is hard currency itself
going to be sufficient to allow cities to work? Hard money is no magic
solution to fraud; neither are armed guards. There needs to be some
sort of additional mechanism to ensure that people are honest and
treat each other fairly despite not being within the same
community. Indeed, any population that was able to do so would be
rewarded with a more prosperous community, both economically, and
technologically.

But per community morals, this sort of thing should end in
nothinb but tears. These sorts of cosmopolitan cities are full of outsiders and they will take advantage
of you. Remember the techniques the closed communities used to protect
themselves from sociopaths and the amoral? Won't work in a medievl
city. Yet somehow cities and towns flourished. In the past two hundred years,
the trend has dramatically accelerated, to the point where the
situation has reversed, and now few people live in small
communities. In this situation, the gift economy is entirely
unsuitable, as you concievably never see the person you are doing
business with again. So the the money and marketplace is necessary to
work together.

But something else is necessary. Given that "natural" morals are built
for survival in small communities, one would think that this would be
an unsustainable transfer. Wouldn't humans be morally incapable of
living in cities? Wouldn't our clannish nature gradually overtake our
economic incentive to do so? It would certainly seem that whatever
morals we had evolved would not work when going from a society of a
few hundred people seen throughout our lives to one where thousands of
strangers could conceivably be encountered in a day. Aside from money,
there was one missing piece that allowed everything to work: other
virtues.

These new virtues have allowed us to work together and these
are instructive and should be studied. At this point, one of the
challenges is coping with the fact much as industrialization has
forced people to adopt new moral codes to work and cooperate with
people outside of our city, we need new moral codes to work with
humans on a global scale. Yet where will these come from?  The answer
is the same as it was for the morals necessary to live in the
cities.

-----------------------------

To live in cosmopolitan society, one needs a set of what I would call
"cosmopolitan virtues." These are virtues not present in
community-based virtues. Some of these would include the following:

* Justice and evenhandness: giving each his or her due reward,
  regardless of community membership.

* Compassion: ability to feel for others regardless of situation.

* Tolerance: ability to work with others from outside of what you feel
  is your own community.

* Idealism: recognition that there the right life is not defined by
  the community but by things outside of the community.

* Charity and kindness: ability to give to others (in the sense of
  gift economy) even though one is unlikely to be paid back.

Where did these come from? The mere fact that this is a Baha'i
telegraphs my thoughts on the matter.

Throughout much of history, there was not a concept of something
called a "religion." Or rather, it wasn't a distinct thing. You were
in a community, your community had beliefs about morals and religious
things, and that was that. Community itself was bound up in religion
and vice versa. If you go back about three thousand years ago, you
will see that this is so. The reification of the concept of "a
religion" was not even defined until several centuries ago - if you
didn't adhere to the community religion, you were a pagan and/or an
infidel and that was that.

However, there were major developments, starting around 3000 years
ago, that changed this. Spiritual ferment, happening in different
places and in different times, produced three major religious
movements, whose ramafications spread throughout a wide radius through
what was then the "civilized world" of Asia,
Europe and North Africa:

Buddhism
Christianity
Islam

These three world religions, little noticed at the time of their
founding, spread across the globe such that by 1000 AD, there was
pracically no area in Europe, Asia or North Africa that was fully
under the sway of one of these religions. Unlike earlier religions, they
were not married to a community, culture or even a nation: they
presented themselves as universal, cosmopolitan religions, fit for any
believer willing to believe.

In roughly the same time, other religions saw dramatic reformation
efforts which made them more universal in scope. In India, works like
_The Upanishads_ made it possible to talk about the many flavors of
Hinduism as a single faith. And as for Judaism, prior to the "Jesus
movement," Judaism had spread throughout various Greek communities
independent of claimed Israeli nationality, and the Jewish reformation
efforts after the destruction of the temple in the first centry AD
made it possible to think of a Jewish religion independent of the
Jewish people. As a result, the concept of "religion" as such was
finally possible - prior to that, it was part and parcel of "the community."

Note that this formulation is in terms of a Baha'i cosmology;
e.g. spiritual progression as a cycle of revelation. There have been
other religious writers that have made similar discoveries; e.g. the
proposed "Axial Age" of Karl Jaspers, popularized through writings
such as Karen Armstrong's _The Great Transformation_. From a Baha'i
point of view, the distinctions between a so-called axial age and the
manifestations are a bit of a "poTAYto / poTAHto" distinction - you
don't have one without the other. The important think about this is
that all of these universal religious placed a novel emphasis on the
"cosmopolitan" virtues - and reformations in Judaism, Zoriastrianism,
Hinduism, Jainism and Chinese thought (Confucianism and Taoism) made
it possible to think in terms of moral virtues that made life within
and across entire civilizations possible.

From a secular point of view, this would seem to be simply an
adaptation to changing points of view. Yet this presumes that this
would have happened without these spiritual movements. Of the secular
movements to occur in the axial age, perhaps the Greek and Roman
philosophical movements are the most significant. Yet it took Muslim
and Christian philosophers and scholars to spread and popularize their
thought beyond their original matrix in Greek cultural life. To go to
a purely secular thought system to revolutionize moral thought, you
have to go forward to the liberalism of the enlightenment - and that
was originally rooted in Christianity as well.

Where does that take us? Where that takes us is that the "instinctual"
morality that we share as a human race is a decidedly incomplete moral
birthright. It grants us the ability to act thoughtful to friends and
family. Yet it seems to guarantee a state of prepetual conflict
of one sort or other between communities. To get along in cities and
to get along between communities and nations requires the unity that
only more cosmopolitan virtues can give us. Western liberal thought
has attempted to be that universal value, but unfortunately has proven
too brittle. In short, it can change some people, but it leaves us
with the push and pull of cosmopolitanism versus community.

---------------------------

So what can be done? well, the answers are already there. The great
religious leap forward is what one might call an "open community."
That is, a community that one can join and leave without
will. Religious are not
