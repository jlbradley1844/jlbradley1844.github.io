I'd like to believe this article on [moral
grandstanding](https://aeon.co/ideas/moral-grandstanding-theres-a-lot-of-it-about-all-of-it-badf)
is sincere. But I've been alive long enough to know otherwise. Ugh,
more of _this_. I'm afraid this new attack will become beloved by
armchair libertarian philosophers trying to wish away ethics by
somehow claiming it's "unfair." And while the article does raise a
point, there's a strong element of "methinks the lady doth protest too
much." With all the moral problems out there, is this _really_
something that demands our attention?

"The problem is that itâ€™s hard to tell if someone really is
grandstanding." Well, duh. There is a lot of moral talk, and if it's
effective, it's _going_ to bother someone. That's the point. If someone
feels cornered, or if their conscience is starting to pester them,
their first reaction is to change the subject, try to shut it down, or
attempt to frame someone as immoral for merely _bringing_ up the
subject.

I do a fair bit of "moral talk"; I suppose this puts me in the
category of a moral granstander. This article says moral grandstanding
is "moral talk to project an impressive and morally respectable image
of ourselves." I don't do it for this reason. I do it to make people
who make immoral decisions look less impressive and morally
irrespectable. 
Mathematically, this is equivalent. In any case, I drive a prius,
recycle, don't screw around on my wife, don't drink and try to
treat well those who formally report to me at work. All of which are
moral choices that I made without imposing anything on others, yet all
of which have been framed as "virtue signaling" by some jerkwad
someplace or other, either in-person or in some article a "friend"
posted to facebook. This complaint isn't anything new, and I do not
yield anything to the dirt clods of the world that would allow them yet another
rhetorial arrow in their quiver.

The fact is, certain sorts of immoral behavior hurts everyone. We
presently have an outbreak of countries being run by dangerous,
narcissistic child because a lot of 
people decided that sending a signal to "snowflakes" they've disliked
since junior high was more important
that acting like a mature adult in the voting booth. The fact that
so-many self-proclaimed libertarians voted for someone who openely,
repeatedly espoused authoritarian beliefs is virtue signaling all
right - it signals a lack thereof, and if there is Karma, that black
eye is going to stay with that movement
for decades. I, personally, am not going to shut up about this
stuff. If it takes the hectoring of millions to make certain people
think twice about making immoral decisions, I'm happy to volunteer to
play church lady, even if it all it earns me is the offense of others.

As for you, go ahead and moral grandstand all you want. I'll cheer you
on, and maybe I'll even bring popcorn for you.
