## The Real Reason Creeds and Politics Don't Mix
One of the core beliefs of the Baha'i Faith is that we should avoid
involvement in partisan political activities. By extension, that means
our leaders and aministrators are going to avoid this sort of
involvement as well. We participate and vote, as it is our right and
duty as citizens of our country, and even get involved in certain
activities, but we do not align ourselves with political parties
publicly or privately. I recommend other creeds do the same - or at
least, have the wisdom to publicly excuse themselves from the mistake
of lining themselves up with a partisan program.

As a believer, it is a bit nowadays difficult to write without seeming
to be political anyway. This is a hazard of our present movement. If
there is a large giant bird-eating spider in the room, my actions are
going to betray the fact there is giant bird-eating spider in the
room, even if someone would rather I ignore it, or worse yet, pretend
that perhaps this spider is merely misunderstood. But in a case like
that, further elaboration is also unnecessary, and the best bet is to
press on with one's business, spider or no.

Be that as it may, this condition didn't come out of nowhere; I
feel that moral behavior of the population as a whole, and moral
behavior of religious creeds in particular, have resulted in wide-scale
political failures. This is a self-evident notion from study of the
writings and current newspapers, and you may read this as criticism of
particular politicians as you will. Fortunately, as bad as one may
think it is, in the democratic states, the Baha'i community has not
been on the recipient of threats by militant partisan groups - yet -
and for that we can be thankful.

To a very real effect, our non-involvement has been an un-alloyed
good. When Shoghi Effendi wrote to American believers some 70-80 years
ago that neither Democratic nor Republican programs of politics
properly reflected the Baha'i program, one could easily point out
areas of both agreement and disagreement between Baha'i belief and the
beliefs of both parties. The Baha'i Faith, which is always been
cosmpopolitan, is even moreso now. Fortunately or unfortunately, that
program has come to be alingned much moreso with one of the policial
parties, and it seems this will remain the case _at this current
time_. This does _not_ mean that we should align ourselves with a
political party.

Of course, we should not distance ourself from issues just because
they seem associated with said political party. Avoiding political
entanglements is not advocating a "too-pure" attitude toward the
world; it is necessary to keep us from committing ourselves to a
program which is liable to steer off course. By avoiding this
entanglement, it should be perfectly clear that when individual
Baha'is and institutions do comment on something that may be
_perceived_ politically, it is due core beliefs at hand, not due to a
intent to support a political program or to curry favor with those in
power. Were we to align ourselves in any way, not only would it be
seen as serving a political party instead of our Spiritual Master, it
would also be an encumberance; once one identifies oneself with a
political party (or cause of any sort), one is much loath to admit to
either oneself or others that things have gone badly off track.

Unfortunately, the mistake of alignment seems to appears to have
happened for many of the other creeds in the world. It seems that
every authoritarian movement has their own favored creed that stands
to gain from association with the political movement. Sadly, many
creeds do not understand the dangers of this association. The reality
is what is being made is a payoff. If you align yourself with a
political party, _it is presumed their actions are in conformance with
their creed_. This is true even if you do not openly recommend one
party. If your denomination insists on passing out a "voter's guide"
suggesting how members of your creed should vote, is this not a
prescription of political belief? If you recommend straight-ticket
voting of one political party, are you not aligning yourself with that
party? Heaven forbid Baha'i adminstrators ever make that sort of mistake.

As to leaders of creeds who publicly align
themselves with political parties: one would expect that the know that
* political
parties will go horribly off course on occasion, and
* when they do, one is loath to disassociated yourself from them due
to fear of loss of influence and relationships, and
* this partisan loyalty will be taken as an indication by both
believers and non-believers that
the parties _real_ creed is in conformance with these political
beliefs, whatever teachings they may claim to follow:

Given this, is public alignment with a political party really wise?

Think of a believer in a creed whose authorities have made this
mistake, and now see that their ecclesiastes are publicly supporting
politicians and programs in obvious violation of their core religious beliefs.
Now, as an individual believer, you can claim #NotAllEvangelicals
or #NotAllRussianOrthodox all you want as a means of distancing
yourself from such parties. But over time, the individual is going to
publicly and privately distance themself from the creed.

Given the significant move away from traditional denominations, I'm
afraid this is one reason for loss of religious faith. I saw it in the
south where I grew up. The shift to evangelicals did not come out of
nowhere. In my Catholic church, which tended to be on the centrist
sde, we had certain priests who talked a lot about sin and
coming to church and participating in the sacraments and "good stuff"
like that; and we had certain priests who talked about racism and
social justice and charity and stuff like that. Note that I very much
hesitate to label them "conservative" and "liberal" because my
understanding is that both were very much part of the Catholic
church. And I definitely noticed that during my middle-school and
teenage years, some parents of my friends were definitely drifting
away from Catholocism and toward the Christian churches, claiming that
it was "watered down." Unfortunately, it didn't seem that way to me -
a bit of conversation and it seemed evident they were unhappy to
occasionally happen to listen to homilies that might be labeled
"liberal."

Rather than notice or even fight this trend, they were quite happy to
pick up the slack, and now you have the mainline protestent churches
denuded. Is this a win for Christ? Hardly! The result of this partisan
association has been a subsequent flatlining of membership in
evangelical denominations, as anyone who does not think of themself
first as a "conservative" without a religious upbringing would hardly
find themselves interested in this spiritual path.

It is a challenge for believers of all creeds to realize that whatever
your political inclinations, there is _no_ political party that is in
proper conformance with your belief system as properly understood.
