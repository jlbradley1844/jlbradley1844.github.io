# The Right Kind of Uncool (or, About Progressive Rock)
## Part II

I wrote a post where I discussed the unfair reasons why rocked critics disliked
progressive rock. I shoved it into the cutting floor - it seemed to
much like venting to be worth publishing. I'm hoping this post is
useful - where to get started for the uninitiated.

This post also discusses the one uncontested valid reason for
disliking progressive rock, and how you can avoid it.

There is a point that critics have about progressive rock I must admit is
valid: a lot of prog was bad. SERIOUSLY bad.

To show how bad it could get, let's take apart the discography of one
band who was not afraid to be labeled as proggy and pretentious:
Emerson Lake and Palmer. How proggy were they? Let's go through the
prog rock checklist:

* Dismissive of ordinary rock and roll: check
* Ludicrous stage getup: check
* Over-the-top Liberace-style virtuoso displays: check
* Pervasive logo imagery appearing on all merchandise: check
* Name worthy of a legal firm: check
* You secretly suspect all the band members hate each other: check

Their discography is a mess. ELP has one acknowledged masterpiece:
_Brain Salad Surgery_. They have two others that are legitimately very
good: _Trilogy_ and the epynomous _Emerson, Lake and Palmer_.  Another
one, _Tarkus_, is their equivalent to Yes' _Tales of Topographic
Oceans_ - a creatively-undisciplined mess beloved by hardcore
neckbeareded fans and hated by everyone else. And finally, they have a
number of other mediocre recordings, mostly from the late seventies
and later, that bear no hint of the brilliance of their best work and
are hardly worth a second listen.

Such discographies are unfortunately typical of prog acts. Yes
released three great albums over the span of less than three years,
and aside from that, produced only a few other very good albums over
the remainder of a career spanning *decades*. Genesis survived,
essentially, by becoming less prog; King Crimson was
frequently brilliant but wildly inconsistent; the list
goes on. You aren't going to find a streak like the Rolling Stones or
the Beatles or Stevie Wonder put together here, where an act puts
together an unbreakable string of half-dozen straight
masterpieces. Instead, the typical prog act produced a smattering of
albums that are truly great, a bunch more that are very good... and a
lot that just didn't wear that well.

As for you - if you're new to prog, then this actually makes it all
very easy for you. By now, there is considerable agreement on what is
*the best*. And the best, fortunately or unfortunately, are not
numerous.

Here are The Great Ones in no particular order, grouped by
artists. Note the years - almost all of this was early 1970s. I'm
picking those that are known nowadays as prog rock, those where both
the fans and the critics would agree "This is Prog". 

King Crimson:
_The Court of the Crimson King_ (1969)
_Red_ (1974)
_Discipline_ (1981)

Yes:
_Fragile_ (1971)
_Close to the Edge_ (1972)

Genesis:
_Selling England by the Pound_ (1973)

ELP:
_Brain Salad Surgery_ (1973)

Pink Floyd:
_The Dark Side of The Moon_ (1974)
_The Wall_ (1979)

Rush:
_Moving Pictures_ (1981)

and that, unfortunately, is it. I'm tempted to throw in Soft Machine's
_Third_ (1971), which should rightly be considered a classic _jazz
fusion_ album, and Kate Bush's _The Kick Inside_ (1978), just to break
up the boys-only club. But that would be it. The rest are good but not
classic - and yes, that means ELO, the Moody Blues, Kansas, Camel,
etc. The near misses like Kansas and Camel, and the pop-oriented prog
like ELO and Moody Blues, never reached this artistic peak set by the
albums above, and you'll rarely hear their cuts in rotation or hear
musicians cite them as influences. Much as I hate to say it, A Ramones
album is just way more fun than a prog act that never did better than
mediocre (*coughcoughStyxcoughcoughcough*).

Is prog dead? Well, if you scanned the best-of lists of the 2000s and
2010s, you would find a shocking number of experimental, prog-like
groups represented there. Besides the normal post-rock suspects, you'd
find quite a few experimental Indie bands that seem prog-influenced,
not to mention acts that aren't shy about hiding their prog roots:
Sigur Ros, Porcupine Tree, Tool and The Mars Volta all come to
mind. Not to mention the whole post-Rock movement, which started even
earlier and continues with acts like Explosions in the Sky. If
anything, the first decade of the new millenia (the naughties?)
produced more prog-like music in indie rock and metal than the
seventies even did. And let's not forget the monstrous masterpiece
_Kid A_ that kicked off the whole decade.

Yet none of these followers would ever have their music mistaken for
"classic"-period prog of Yes, King Crimson and Genesis.  The
definition of "prog" as a movement barely extending for 10 years is
perhaps as it should be. Musically-challenging artists are always
going to be with us. But it is quite unusual for a movements within a
musical genre spontaneously arise dedicated to its promulgation. It
happened twice in jazz - first, with be-bop in the 1940s, then with
free jazz in the 1960s. In both cases, the movements were lambasted as
being too hard to follow and too uncommercial; both were credited with
"killing jazz"; both were said to serve self-important musicians more
interested in "art" than in entertaining crowds; both were lambasted
by latter-day "guardians of the tradition" as dead-ends that sapped
the strength of the musical art forms that gave them birth. And both
have eventually come to be recognized as critics as two of the most
important innovations in jazz: essential movements within the field
responsible for pushing the genre out from over-commercialization and
artistic dead ends, yammerings of Wynton Marsalis and Stanley Crouch
notwithstanding.

The fact that critics still bellyache about prog long after its
commercial demise do not keep today's newest musicians from looking
back at prog antecedents - no matter how much they violate the holy
trinity of "blues-based guitar music of simple song forms." Indeed,
the whole britpop and indie rock movements dedicated to the
canonization of guitar-based stripped-down post-punk song forms,
rather than enlivening the art form, were instead responsible for
deadening the rock genre, producing a plethora of indistinguishable
sounding bands, none substantially better than the other. This to such
an extent that a Guardian article dubbed an entire genera "Indie
Landfill."  Who is the next Oasis, the next Strokes, or the next
Arctic Monkeys?  Unfortunately, it hardly matters. All you need is an
album full of AABAs songs, 4 chords and a dream. If there is a rock
rebirth, the credit will not go to these acts, but to acts who aren't
afraid to shake things up by doing something a little creative (c.f. 
The War on Drugs).

So you have to give credit to bands like Yes and Soft Machine:
they set the bar so ridiculously high that we were never threathened
with "prog landfill" of buzz bands that came and went before the next
Christmas was up. Fans would rather spin _Fragile_ one more time than
waste time listening to a prog wannabe whose only credential was being
able to get their hands on a Mellotron. And that may mean having to
listen to the old guys if nobody releases anything new that's
decent. If that means being incredibly picky with new music, then hey,
it's my ears, and I'm going to take care of them.
