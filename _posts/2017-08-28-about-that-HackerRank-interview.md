Title: Why I Use HackerRank. Still.

# I Know HackerRank Stinks. Here's Why I Use It.
## And What You Can Do About It As a Candidate.
Are you a software engineer? You'll have to deal with something. If,
indeed, you haven't dealt with it dozens of times already. The
technical phone screen - if not using a tool called HackerRank, then
some other whiteboarding program.

It's almost insulting. You've spent years on your education, probably
additional more years in your chosen profession. You have a resume
packed with accomplishments. But in the first phone screen, the
interviewer doesn't ask you a thing about that.

Instead, you're asked to solve simple programming questions for
upwards of an hour - almost an insult to your intelligence.

I'm not the first one to notice the discrepancy.
Other writers have complained about how unnatural and unfair this sort
of thing is. Some have compared this to "scrimmaging" - the sort of
basic practice drills that atheletic recruiters do that are used to
compare between draft candidates. These exercises are notorous for
overlooking great players and overrating atheleticism that never adds
up to anything on the field (I think this analogy is courtesy of DHH
but can't find it on [Signal v. Noise](https://m.signalvnoise.com/) -
a great blog but a total aside). Obviously, sitting down and coding
something is a tiny part of what we do, and ugly problems involving
tree traversals and string manipulation an even smaller part. It would
seem like an odd thing to concentrate on in job interview.

Yet I, as an interviewer, use HackerRank. And I insist on continuing
to do it. I'm writing this so that you understand, and so you know
what to do about it. And hopefully gain some perspective on the other
side of the table when you interview at other companies.

================================

First of all, this is a phone *screen*. When I do a phone screen, I am
not conducting a real "interview." It is an "interview for an
interview." Your resume has gotten through HR and landed on my desk,
but I still have to ensure that I do not waste *your* time, and you do
not waste *my* time. Wasting your lunch hour is inconvenient, but
wasting one of your vacation days by bringing you in if you don't have
a shot is inexcusable.

To this end, to bring you in, I need to first find out this:
1. Can you code your way out of a wet paper bag?
2. Do you really want *this* job, as opposed to *a* job?

Why do I care about those two things in particular, when there are all
sorts of reasons not to hire? In all honesty, because they are the
easiest to tell in a phone interview - and the most common problems
with the candidates we bring in.

This causes far more problems than you would think. Everyone who has
interviewed has had this happen:

> Someone is flown in for an interview, everyone blocks out their
> calendar and the candidate comes in. After one or two sessions, the
> handful of people that have seen him are convinced it's a waste of
> time, and he's walked out early. All that prep time and expense,
> down the drain.

What happened? It's almost always the following:

- The candidate is a very unskilled hands-on coder. He cannot write a
  simple program in the language he claims to have expertise in.
- The candidate is a poor communicator. Not in the sense of having an
  accent (a trival concern, in my opinion!), but in the sense of not
  understood what is being asked, 
  solving the wrong problem in spite of repeated clarifications, and
  generally talking past the interviewer.
  
If you get bring in a dozen candidates and half of them wash out for
the same exact reason, it seems evident the way to fix this is to
screen them for exactly those sorts of flaws. And it was no mystery
how to weed them out: walking through some 
beginner-intermediate-level coding exercises on the phone, explaining
as we go, and see if they actually knew what they were doing.

Hence, the HackerRack
phone screen.

Unfortunately, you, the interviewee, pay for this inconvenience by
spending an hour on a coding drill.

In our defense, a lot of the current interviewing practices widely
recommended by technical recruitiers are even more onerous, and
neither me nor my peers are cool with them. They include:

* Requiring extensive online portfolios of work;
* Lengthy "take-home" assignments;
* Repeated in-person interviews just to "make sure";
* The ludicrous "brain-teasers" that Google and Microsoft popularized,
then abandoned just as everyone else was picking them up.

Our view is that one or two phone screeens followed by a rigorous
in-person interview is both necessary and sufficient. Google and most
other solid engineering companies who value their talent have found
the same.

-----------------

However, I'm also asking you, the job candidate for your help. I
promise it will help you. I have a problem:

I confess. The process isn't flawless. I've seen a pretty fair number
of candidates that look great on paper, but did horribly in coding
interviews. In many cases, I suspect they had faked their otherwise
impressive resumes, or at least fudged it to make themselves look far
more central to their teams' success. On the other hand, I
occasionally run into candidates who do quite badly, in spite of the
fact that when I dig into their background, they seemed to know what
they were talking about. False positives being worse than false
negatives, I still have to say no and pass on the candidate.

I can see how a capable senior engineer can get in the position where
they whiff an intermediate whiteboard review. If you get to a
senior-enough level, you will spend most of your time reviewing code,
writing specs, designing, and working in meetings, and when you do
code, it tends to be small surgical fixes in environments where you
are surrounded by an ultraproductive tooling environment that you
yourself had a hand in developing. If you've been doing that for
years, you could easily be caught flat-footed in a whiteboard coding
environment. I myself blew a hard-to-get in-person interview at a
highly sought-after employer because of just that thing. In hindsight,
it was easily avoidable.

SO IF YOU ARE A CANDIDATE: this may not be fun, but you owe it to your
interviewers to meet them halfway. Please do at least a minimum to show that
you can _demonstrate_ your skills in a phone screen. This doesn't
require a lot, but it does require some investment in time:

1. Get used to coding in a minimal whiteboard-type environment.

2. Familiarize yourself with common problem types.

    That's it!

    For #1 I recommend you get an account on hackerrank or one of the more
    common "groupware" programming environments. (Unfortunately, you don't
    get to pick, so I don't mean Visual Studio Online.) If you've been
    pushed into common senior engineer roles where you spend much more
    time reviewing code and doing API-wrangling than doing mainline work,
    you may be much rustier than you realize! The good news is that a few
    hours in one of these environments will have you *much* more
    comfortable in one of these whiteboarding situations.

    For #2, pick up some problems online and do them. Books like _Cracking
    the Coding Interview_ lean heavily on this sort of thing and may be
    overkill; likewise, stuff like the ACM Programming Contests are lots
    of fun. But the more challenging problems are definitely overkill and
    too tough for even the most talented candidate to work through in an
    hour. Instead, the stuff I ask on phone interviews (and that most
    people ask) are basic in nature, and a few hours working
    through problems in in algorithm books and doing small implementations
    will help. We also tend to ask questions drawn from real-life
    programming challenges we face, so if you're making a move within the
    same industry, review that sort of stuff - you may get you through the
    phone screen.

    A few hours for a few weekends, and that's it!

    Well, I lied, one more thing:

3. Be _selective_ about the jobs you apply to.

    Didn't expect that, did you? Well, I didn't harp on it. But it's the
    main reason we bounce otherwise qualified candidates that get through
    the whole ceremony.

    There are a lot of people who seem inclined to take an interview, any
    interview, for practice or backup. But we don't want to waste our
    time; do you want to waste yours? If you really want to do data
    science, and your resume is geared toward data science, and all you talk
    about is data science, then by all means apply to *those* jobs.  Don't
    apply to a devops position and try to get the hiring manager to fit
    their job to your chosen field of interest. It's fine - even normal -
    to change jobs so you can change your subfield, but address this fact in
    the cover letter with your resume, and for pete's sake, be prepared to
    address the misfit in the phone screen if asked about it. A lot of
    candidates don't seem to be prepared when we point out mismatches
    between their resume and cover letter and what they say on the phone,
    and we won't fly in a candidate who has given every indication that he
    is "just browsing."

While I realize this seems like "one more thing to do," it's far
better to spend a few hours making sure you can get through simple
phone screens than it is to spend several more hours talking to even
more recruiters.
