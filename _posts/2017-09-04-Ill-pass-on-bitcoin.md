## Bitcoin? Pass.

Some time ago I wrote up a blog post about Bitcoin. It was mainly
negative in nature. I saw a few things that seriously concerned me:

1. It was primarily being used as a "buy-and-hold" commodity instead
of a medium of exchange.
2. It was very inefficient as an exchange protocol, having incredible
transaction costs.
3. It was too slow to serve as an efficient mechanism of exchange.
4. The nonrecourse mechanism makes it generally unsuitable for large
transactions, due to the possibility of fraud.
5. The mechanism through with miners are remunerated have the quality
of a pyramid scheme; that is, they are only able to cover costs so
long as each bitcoin is worth increasingly more. Once the "free money"
runs out, miners will have to cover their costs with transaction
fees. Given the computational cost of clearing just one transaction,
these could be more expensive than credit cards.
6. Arguments regarding the upcoming fork represented an existential
threat to the system.

While I haven't seen anything addressing the above issues, and my
outlook is still negative, the market disagrees with me. Tempted as I
am to "go short," I know that I will time it badly, paying a ton for
my puts (if indeed I can even get those) and pull out just before the
thing collapses.

This time, I want to discuss something of more concern - the
proliferation of alternate currencies. And why this will _eventually_
cause bitcoin to collapse due to lack of demand.

Bitcoin itself is said to be a mechanism of _exchange_ and a _store_
of value. Why is it a store of value? Because - you can use it for
exchange. The need for exchange *is* why you can use it as a store of
value.  In other words, when you buy bitcoin you are paying to "get in
the game." If you don't intend to use bitcoin to exchange it, then
you're just buying it for the privelege of hopefully selling it to
someone else later, and it's the "greater fool" theory (i.e. you're
buying it for what seems to be a foolish price in the hope you can
sell it for an even higher, more foolish price). But if you buy
bitcoin for exchange, then you are getting into it for the service.

Some have said there is no way to value bitcoin. But this is
nonsense. You can value it base on _the value you get by using bitcoin
for exchange instead of something else_. By doing it this way, you can
value it in the standard mathematical models of a hedge; e.g. in
exactly the same approach that options were first calculated using
Black-Scholes, and other financial instruments.

If it's a financial instrument, treat it like a financial instrument!

Someone [link required] involved in etherium warned about the
exploding growth of altchains and nonsense currencies, and indicated
that the present blockchains were suitable and should be standardize
on that. This is humbug, and the worst sort of self-centered
nonsense. Bitcoin was concieved as one of many competing currencies -
competing with "government currency." The reason such people now don't
like these competing currencies is because they are now long major
currencies long. Any alternate currency is competing for cash from
speculators. The hope of those holding bitcoins is that
that network effects will make it *necessary*
for others to purchase the currency that is presently held long by
entities holding very large blocks of currency, and therefore prop up
the price.

However, people should be careful what they wish for. You can make a
few mistakes with these.

Let's look at money. Cold hard cash. To separate the money the
currency from money the value, you must break down the components,
based on what they are worth to you.

Let's look at physical currency. That evil "government paper" the
bitcoiners tell you we should all be rid of. If I have $200 of cash in
my pocket, I would tell you the currency itself is WORTH $203. Why is
that? Here's my breakdown:

$200 - what the money can always be used for
  $3 - what I paid for it at the ATM.

In other words, I have $200 for the underlying "money," but I have
paid an additional $3.00 for the underlying money itself - the
currency, if you will. So the _currency_ part is worth more.

Now, if I tell you this, you might say, "No, the currency part is
worth less, there is a part due to the _convenience_ of you accessing
the currency." In which case, we can both agree that the currency is
worth less than $3.00, but more than, say, a few cents. Given that the
least we can access money from an ATM from is $1.00 (if you can find
an ATM for Actor's Credit Union, I wonder if they still do that), and
those ATMs tend to _draw_ business, we can say the worth of the
currency is typically somewhere in the neighborhood of %0.5-%1.0 of the
money it represents.

So those who _hold_ currency seem to value it at about this level. We
can guage this based on what you might call a "market-driven" analysis
of this concept. Were the value of the currency less than this, nobody
would access their money because of the ATM fees, and  were the value
of currency more than this, people would willingly pay more. To some
extent, this is due to the free proliferation of ATMs. But that in
itself answers the question. If the fees that ATMs charged were seen
as excessive, this would draw more competitors, until there was a sort
of equilibirum. If the fees that ATMs charged were too low, fewer
would be installed, because the lack of aggregate demand would not be
enough to subsidize the ATMs themselves. So ATMs themselves are a good
proxy for value.

You could then say, "NO, this is nonsense. You could conduct your
business in cash! You could have an all-cash household and get paid in
cash totally. So you would you value currency then? There, you've paid
nothing for currency, because CASH IS MONEY, nyah nay!" To which I'd
respond - does anyone actually do that? The answer is no. And why?
It's because when people hold cash, whether they're keeping their
money in a bank and accessing it through an ATM, or keeping it in a
mattress, they must pay for the holding of that currency representing
the money in some way or another. Someone who is holding all cash -
and I mean all of it - has to deal with losses from theft. A more
common case of paying no money was my Dad when I was growing up in the
seventies - he got a paycheck, went to the bank and deposited it, then
got back a set amount of cash. However, he paid for it in by waiting
in line! How much was his time worth? Guess what, you can tell by
looking at... wait for it... ATM fees.

A more common way to get around the ATM fees is to use banks where if
you hold an account, you incur no in-network fees to access
cash. Again, this is easy to justify - the banks are simply leaving
money on the table to lure customers in. If you get a
checking account with a trivial $100 minimum balance, you probably
aren't going to get the free-AMT deal; that's reserved for the
minimum-$5000-balance crowd. You are, in effect, being
subsidized to induce you to leave a lot of cash lying around in the
bank's reserves. So here, the bank is paying for it, in regard to foregone
profits. Obviously they intend another mechanism to capture an
equivalent amount from you in doing so.

So the end result of this analysis? Access to cash is not free - you
pay for it one way or another. A reasonable amount might be %0.5 of
the cash held.

Let's take this a bit further. Suppose you aren't talking the pocket
change that one usually talks about with currency. Suppose you were
nuts enough to have $1,000,000 of cash lying around. Based on the
above valuation, by having it in currency, you also have a "value" of
$5000 due to it being in currency form. Let's step back - does that
seem reasonable?

At first, it does not - it would seem to be _negative_ value. All
other things being equal, having that much currency lying around is a
huge hassle. You have currency controls; you can't just go to the bank
and deposit it, it's incredibly unsafe to leave it anywhere outside of
a safe. Does that mean that in the case of
small amounts currency has positive value, but in large amounts
currency has negative value?

If that's what you're thinking, you've out-thought yourself. If
someone owes you $1,000,000, and they choose to pay it in cash, why
did you choose to take it in cash? Why didn't you
take a bank check like any sane person? Why did the debtor go to the
trouble of emptying out the currency reserves of all the bank
branches? The fact is, when you took $1,000,000, both you and the
seller went to a great deal of inconvenience to make this a cash-only
transaction. Obviously you've
decided that the inconvenience of holding it worth the trouble of
taking it; in other words, it's so unnatural that you must have
decided that taking it as cash is _desireable_. Whether or not you
think having it in currency form is worth $5000, you have clearly paid
for the inconvenience of having it in cash, instead of in a bank where
it can easily be wired around quickly for a small fee.

That gets to another point - the value of currency to a
_seller_. We've already talked about the value of currency to a
holder; that is someone who is going to use currency to buy
things. But there are two sides to any transaction. The seller who
receives money in these exchanges must also be accounted for.

So the buyer derives some sort of benefit from having the
currency. The seller does too - in that the seller can conduct
business. However, the economics for the seller are a bit different.

When you transfer the currency, you are transferring both the money,
and the "additional value" that is captured by having the
currency. This stands to reason, right? So all other things being
equal, since the buyer values the currency and is transferring the
currency to the seller, the seller will also value the currency as
well. And this works to some extent in the marketplace. Many small
business owners are happier working with currency. And you still see a
fair bit of things like gas stations offering lower prices for cash
than credit.

But in general, sellers do not reap the full benefit of dealing in
currency. Why? Well if it's person-to-person (say, buying something in
craigslist), usually it's more convenient and the currency value is directly
transferred to the seller, in the form of "Yay, not only did I sell my
bike, but I don't have to go to the ATM now!" But generally sellers,
do not reap the full convenience. Why? Because they bear the overhead
of dealing with the cash; they have to deal with trips to the bank to
stock different smaller denominations. They are also vunlerable to
theft from the till. In general, unless vendors have a really lousy
deal with credit card companies (like gas stations), it costs them
more to transact business in cash than with credit cards.

Plus there is a cost to society for cash. It costs the government
money to mint and distribute cash. Forget about egregious examples
like the penny, where the goverment pays MORE for the currency than it
is worth - even things like your lowly dollar bill takes a fair amount
of money to mint.

The result is that there is a "deadweight loss" to society when
business is conducted in cash. People derive value from holding cash,
but generally it is lost with the transaction. In the case of credit
and debit card transfers, some of this is captured with transaction
fees, but there is a deadweight loss to the credit card companies in
the cost of running their own business, as those networks aren't free.

Note that I'm not saying this is a bad thing. The existence of legal
currency means that there are at least no _explicit_ transaction costs
for businesses that use cash. As for large amounts, cash in hand is
not valueless either. Using cash, it is possible to carry out a
virtually untraceable, non-recourse purchase. For many exchanges, this
is desired by either buyers or sellers, making cash a preferred
alternative. These are not necessarily illegal transactions; there are
some lines of business where this sort of no-strings exchanges are
needed for both buyers and sellers to conduct business, as a sort of
explicit endorsement of a "caveat emptor" line of buiness. This sort
of guarantee _might_ be possible in other payment systems, but for
hard currency, it is more or less intrinsic nature to the currency.

So why is a currency of value, then? A good currency is one that does
two things: 
* For the buyer and seller, it helps ease transactions by lowering the
transaction cost.
* For the marketplace as a whole, it is structured to lower the
deadweight costs for the maintenance of the currency in the
marketplace.

So this is how a currency is good. And the better a currency is at
doing these things, the more valuable it is, and the more people will
use it for their transactions. There may additionally be additional
value associated with the 
currency itself; the difficulty in traceability of hard cash is
usually not a problem for buyers and sellers, but is sometimes
explicitly valued by some parties, making it attractive in some cases.

So to restate the above point: why should someone hold bitcoins _as
currency_? Because by holding 
bitcoins, it allows someone to conduct business *more cheaply* and
with a *lower deadweight cost* to the marketplace as a whole.

Let's restate some basic economics. Why are bitcoins in demand? There
are two reasons:
1. Because people wish to hold them temporarily so as to perform
transactions
2. Because people wish to hold them for appreciation in value, _in the
expectation that there will be more need for usage in transactions in
the future_

Currently, a transaction cost in BTC averages around $0.83 in US
[http://moneyandstate.com/the-true-cost-of-bitcoin-transactions/](source). This
is both because you have to go through intermediaries (oh the
irony). Let's compare this with cash, as in "the cash in your wallet":

FOR THE PURCHASER: Presume a cost of 0.5% for cash, as opposed to a
flat $0.83 transaction fee. BTC is of NO VALUE if your average
transaction cost is less than $166 and the seller does not pick up the
fee. Compare that to a credit card, where 
 the transaction fee will be zero. Of course, the seller might want to
 underwrite it - but you still
have the transaction fees needed to "load" your wallet.

FOR THE SELLER: It makes a little more sense here - presuming most
customers pay with credit cards (where you can count on eating the
1-3% transaction fee), and the "shrinkage" from the till for cash
transactions. Additionally, BTC transactions are non-reversible, so
there is no worry of an unhappy customer challenging the payment
after-the-fact.
However, you have little way of incentivizing this
behavior, since in practice you are not allowed to charge a penalty
for paying in cash. You could pick up the transaction fee, but you'd
be very tempted to put on a minimum charge for fees then - what
retailer wants to pay $0.83 for a $5.12 transaction? So basically,
you'll only save money in the case of larger
transactions. Additionally, sellers have to take on an added risk, in
that they will be forced to accept payment before the transaction
clears because of the slow transaction times of BTC. Many sellers will
not do that, particularly in fraud-ridden areas of the economy where
BTC is seen as compelling!

So what do we have here? We have a system where for petty cash,
transaction costs make bitcoin useless for small purchases. For large
purchases, they are a nice workaround for sellers. So we have a use
case if a seller decides they will take cash or BTC but not credit
card, but only for large purchases. That's a use case that works. But
it is hardly compelling enough to overturn the system! It looks to me
like "yet another payment network."

Yet there are two additional, nasty considerations to keep in mind.

----------------------------------------

The first is that transaction costs are as good as they're going to
get. BTC already has a tiered system that where you have to pay a lot
in transaction costs to get transactions cleared in reasonable time
(see link above). Yet most of those transaction costs go to
intermediaries, not miners. The miners are still getting nominal
transaction fees, but mainly expect their mining operations to foot
the bill. By design, those mining operations will pay less over time
while compuational load will continue to increase. Eventually, they
will need a decent-sized cut.

There is one additional consideration that have not yet introduced,
but it may be the big one. It is not at all the case for regular
currency. It is much less of a currency for "pegged" transactions. But
it is very much the case for bitcoin. That is currency risk.

We know for a fact that bitcoin makes a lot more sense for large
transactions, due to it's "flat-fee" nature. Indeed, the community
itself seems to encourage holding of large banks of coins, as a way to
ensure both buy-in to the system and boost holdings. But this comes at
the expense of making this a usable monetary currency. The larger your
holdings, the greater your exposure to currency risk.

What is currency risk?  That is the change in value you
incur due to changes in the value of money itself. If you had the sort
of funds in your BTC wallet that you have in your regular wallet, this
may not be that big a deal. Obviously, when you look at currency from
an ATM versus money in a bank account, your ATM withdrawl is exposed
to some currency risk, though likely not much - inflation is quite
unlikely to spike in the two weeks you might have a withdrawl. There
is a big difference with a BTC wallet where values CAN spike - or
crash. This makes even holding small amounts of currency in a wallet
subject to unusual risk, as one does not normally fund a wallet one
week only to find out one does not have sufficient currency next week
because of price drop. But if you have

There is a big difference if you have a huge amount of cash. Suppose
you have $1,000,000 in a mattress. Just one week of currency will lose
the equivalent value of hundreds of dollars every week due to ordinary
inflation; if you kept it in a bank, you have money markets to protect
against just that sort of thing. Not so for BTC, where currency
volatility can shred your holdings.

To analyse further: When we hold bitcoins as
currency, we intend to use it for transactions. There are two sorts of
transactions involved:
1. Dollar denominated (or other traditional currency) and
2. Bitcoin denominated
In the case of dollar denominated translation, you have explicit
currency-related risk; you are essentially buying a forward on the
currency when you convert your dollars to bitcoins to make the
transaction. Why? Because you will not be able to transact
instantaneously - you will have to
1. Convert your dollars to bitcoins
2. Make the purchase
3. And the seller must convert bitcoins back to dollars.
If you hold bitcoins in a wallet long-term, then you can amortize step
1 over a large number of transactions, but steps 2 and 3 must be
carried out by the seller in any case. So just having cash in your
bitcoin wallet is an investment, with the risks that entails.

What about the analysis of bitcoin-denominated transactions? I'm not
sure that is worth bothering since those are practically nonexistent;
when you see a price in bitcoins, it is pegged to a denomination like
dollars behind-the-scenes. The currency risk to the seller is too
great to do otherwise; a rapid run-up in the value of BTC will cause
the seller's prices to quickly become uncompetitive and a rapid fall in
BTC will suddenly expose sellers to selling at prices in which they
cannot possibly cover their costs.

------------

I personally don't like bitcoin for a number of reasons. I listed many
of these above. But in addition to those listed above, there are two
final heuristics that lead me to believe that BTC is a failed project:

1. To date, there is no efficient, effective way of integrating
bitcoin into ecommerce; no open-source framework with a HOWTO to get
you started on integrating it seamlessly for commerce. I have numerous
HOWTOs and books on how it works in theory and how to get "involved"
in the community, how to "load your wallet," and all that nonsense. I
have not yet seen a book on frameworks for easily facilitating
transactions. The lack of such a focus would seem to mean that
bitcoins are not solving a problem that developers have. Were the
community truly serious about using bitcoin for COMMERCE, this would
be the significant problem. The goal should be to make this as easy to
use as Stripe.

2. There has been no concern whatsoever about the volatility of BTC as
a currency. For all of the hoopla about BTC eliminating the need for
central bankers, commerce to date has done nothing but prove the need
for hard currency. Why? Because prices themselves are pegged against
dollars, not BTC! Without information from $-BTC exchanges, sellers
would not be able to set their costs properly, as all of their costs
are in dollars, resulting in a collapsed marketplace. Why is this not
a concern to the BTC community? This because they are not incentivized
to make a working ecommerce marketplace. _They are incentivized to
make bitcoin price go up_. Perhaps the technical minds that could
resolve this *do* feel it is a concern and have been too preoccupied
with "the fork" to pay attention to this. Given the well-documented
costliness and duration of bitcoin transactions, this does appear to
consitute an existential threat to BTC, even more than volatility. But
once this is settled, I very much doubt the focus will turn to
volatility or currency stabalization. Instead, the focus will turn
toward other measures meant to encourage buy-and-hold strategies meant
to inflate the value of BTC, if only to continue compensating the miners.

These two things lead me to believe that the collective goal of the
community as a whole is _not_ the creation of a stable alternative
currency. Indeed, it seems much more like a pyramid scheme, and as
much as it's backers may object, they should ponder the fact that most
of its backers sound a lot more like investors at the bottom rungs of
a multi-level marketing scheme than do commercial middlemen. Both
opportunities can be potentially lucrative; only one of them requires
you to evangelize a "buy-and-hold" investment mentality to the greater
community. When its backers use phrases like "Keep the faith!" in
their email .sigs, one realizes this is not a serious business
concern; it is a dressed-up multilevel marketing ploy masquerading as
a business opportunity.

--------------------

In the meantime, there is a lack of rigorous thinking about proper
valuation and competition from other electronic currencies. BTC
holders seem unconcerned about such things, in spite of the fact that
other electronic currencies may be more effective. The greatest threat
to BTC is not federal officials and government conspiracies to destroy
the currency; it is not even the PR dumpster fire of news regarding
the fork and exchanges going belly-up and illegal transactions and
money laundering. No, the biggest danger is that _a different
electronic currency will become a defacto standard for exchange_. Once
that happens, demand for BTC will collapse, and will collapse
quickly. Why? Because the main reason to hold BTC is the unspoken
assumption that others not holding BTC will one day be _compelled_ to
do so for commerce. Without that assumption, BTC wallets are simply
long digital signatures being to trade Pokemon cards - fun for a game,
but otherwise valueless as soon as the game goes away.

Absent proper thinking along these lines, the question of intrinsic
value of a BTC is of even greater importance. If
there is an intrinsic value to bitcoins - and there is - then this
should have some effect on the price itself. Why? Because it means
that there will be an _external_ source of demand. Furthermore, such
an external valuation would serve as a defacto peg, 

The question, therefore, is how highly valued various electronic
currencies should be. I presumed based on a sort of "strong market
theory" that money, at least in small denominations, is valued at
a 0.5-1.0% premium of the face value of the cash itself, based on what
people are willing to pay in ATM fees.

Bitcoin derives (or at least, shoud derive) its value from the demand
people would have to carry out transactions in BTC as opposed to
dollars. For it to be competitive, it would need to be a _preferable_
medium for exhange - over not only dollars, but over any other
electronic medium!

This is where much of the valuation comes in. There is only one source
of value - demand for the medium. We can therefore figure on what the
valuation might be, given the demand. As demand to use bitcoin to use
in commers rises, the cost of BTC goes up. As the cost of BTC goes up,
the demand goes down, as people will need fewer BTC to carry out
transactions.

This is the sort of thing that people do with money when modeling
inflation - they calculate the demand for money, how much is in
circulation, how much of it is in savings accounts, the "velocity" of
the money, all this stuff. I know little about such things, and it
would be ridiculous to model it this way. I could no doubt come up
with something, but it may be easier to model it through some other
sorts of mechanisms, using off-the-cuff approximations of a different sort.

---------------------

Let's play  a game.  Suppose there  are 1  million bitcoin  total, and
99.9% bitcoin is held by three large entities, each capturing 33.3% of
the bitcoin.  The other  0.1% is held  by numerous  "small investors."
The small investors as a collective have only 1000 bitcoins, and the
price of each bitcoin has itself been bid up to $1000, bringing the
total capitalization of the 3 entities to 333 million dollars. Note
that the pool of bitcoin in circulation is miniscule - merely $1
million - yet because of large blocks of uncirculating bitcoin,
holders as a collective hold a nominal valuation of 1 BILLION.

So presuming that the small investors cash out and all find buyers, in
the pockets of those that wish to use this for transactions. The
"bitcoin economy" will keep the value pegged at 1 billion so long as
there is an equilibrium keeping the overall demand at 1 million. How
likely is this to happen? It depends on the "velocity" of money. If
people put money into a wallet and keep it around for a few weeks,
making purchases here and there but generally keeping a balance, then
several thousand people engaged in the BTC economy will keep the
valuations inflated to 1 million dollars.

However, supposing people wish to hold BTC for as short a time as
possible - keeping their wallets as empty as possible except briefly
before and after purchases. In such a case like this, you need
hundreds of thousands, even millions of people, to be engaged in "the
bitcoin economy," since collective demand for the currency is going to
be so low.

So why would one engage in this economy? Let's presume that BTC
continues to have no transaction costs. We know this is not the case
in the long term,
as eventually miners will be unable to cover costs as mining
operations turn up fewer coins. But let's go with that. Would you say
that this has no transaction costs? Not really.

For the buyer


How does that compare with cash? Well, we already know that for petty
cash, we incur about a 0.5-1% overhead which is paid for the
convenience of not incurring explicit transaction costs;
e.g. the value of holding money is about that much. Ergo, all other
things being equal, we could say that if BTC gives you the same amount
of value, then the money is worth about that much.
