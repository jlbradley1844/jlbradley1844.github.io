## The Gig Is Up: We All Know It Isn't Really About Free Speech
I grew up in Kentucky, and went to a Catholic high
school. <unconnectedRant>Lots of people up in the northeast have this
"baby boomer" vision of what this was about - nuns who walked around
terrorizing poor children and Brothers who inflicted random beatings
and did creepy things to minors. This is craptacular Hollywood
nonsense. The school I went to had a positive reputation it earned,
and I wouldn't hesitate to send my children there.<endOfRant>

If anything, it was _more_ liberal and tolerant than the public high
schools I was surrounded by. One important reason was that it was
allowed to set its own textbooks and curriculum. That meant it was
able to teach history as it happened, and didn't have to put up with
any schoolboard nonsense about "preserving heritage," otherwise known
as "lying about history."

So they didn't lie about history. Instead, of the 11 years I attended
Catholic school for, I learned in each of these 11 years THE CIVIL WAR
WAS FOUGHT OVER SLAVERY.

None of the amoral fuzziness about it being over "State's rights." I
remember in every history class there was always some scion
of upper middle class southern gentry sticking his hand
in the air to object that "It really was over state's rights..." as if
it was just being mean to insist on a truthful accounting, and that
we'd all be happer if we just insisted in this compromise reading,
which avoids making souther whites, y'know, maybe _feel guilty_ about
the negative parts of their culture. Of course their arguments were
face-saving nonsense, supported by only the most tenditious readings
of the record of history.

The issue of "state's rights" was always a red herring. The _only_
"state's rights" violation they were upset about was the right of the
state to protect the legal framework for chattel slavery from the
federal goverment, and that particular right is the one the civil ware
was fought over.  Were it truly about state's rights, we might be able
to rattle off a half-dozen equally important violations of state's
rights. But no, we can think of only ONE, and oh boy, is it a big one.

---------------------

Let's be clear, when 90% of people believe something, obviously they
are not _all_ bad people. The most charitable expression is that this
is nothing more than a bit of face-saving nonsense, a pantomimed
kabuki dance that one performs in polite company. In that case, one
may think that any outsiders are being rude to point out the truth
underlying it - after all, what's the harm in a little mythmaking if
it means people have a positive story to tell themselves, one more
keeping with a more uplifting self-image? If this is the view one
takes, then it seems that someone who decide to insist on telling the
truth is being "rude."

The countervailing argument is "the truth must be served, whatever the
cost." But then one has to figure the underlying reason for that. What
we have is a case in which a large number of people have decided that
it is better to compromise the truth, not because they're immoral, but
because they've decided that there is no harm in it. Like it our not,
many people are consequentialist in their ethical actions, and as they
_see_ no harm embracing some of these face-saving arbuments, they
aren't going to oppose it. And anyone who insists on making a point
about things isn't going to change their mind.

So why is this important? Becuase from the above, it is obvious the
problem is *not* to berate or "fix" other people's beliefs,
wrongheaded as we may feel them to be.
So polite people keep their peace. In general, there is not much to be
done, provided others do not insist unfactual beliefs on others.
And those of us who are Baha'is are (hopefully) well-trained enough
not to look down on such people, no matter how ill-informed.

Unfortunately, those in the wrong still realize they are wrong on
some level, meaning they'll deploy a rather misleading rhetorical device,
since they usually still feel miffed.

That is: instead of arguing over whether something is right,
instead argue over whether someone has a right to even question it.

What, then, would you do if you are then challenged in this manner?
You can be respectful of people and not think they're evil or in
opposition to you, but at the same time realize they're using a
rhetorical con to lie to themselves. Recognizing the con does not mean
you can feel morally superior to such people. But this fact should not
keep anyone from calling out what it is.

And this con is uniquely pernicious. The con that says the problem
is not the evil committed, but the evil of the impure messengers, who
opposed this evil and chose to limit it for their own selfish
reasons. This misdirection seeks to shut down conversation and clear
thought by making the straight crooked.

Because we
see this rhetorical con being once again used disingenously over race.
Suddenly we now get claims that it is defensible to support the
neo-Nazis and white suprematist protests - not because one agrees with
them, but because of "free speech" considerations. And that "political
correctness" is keeping us from having difficult conversations that
are necessary to move the nation forward.

Once again, someone has decided that they can't defend something
morally, but would instead like to move to a higher ground where there
is a defense.

---------------------

If you are in the ACLU, then you get a pass. Because if you're that
committed, to you it really _is_ about free speech. Groups like the ACLU
defend all sorts of odius people without distinction. I can't back
them, but at least they're consistent.

But let's look at many of the other people who are suddenly
concerned about "free speech" for white suprematists.  Have they
stepped up for free speech rights for leftist radicals? Militant muslims?
Paroled felons? Hardly. On the contrary, the only time
they seem concerned about free speech is when the speaker is either a
right-wing speaker or a well known racialist.

It's about "free speech" in the same way that the civil war was about
"state's rights." When people backed the civil war, they had exactly
*one* state's right in mind: the right of the state to protect slavery
as an institution without interference by the federal government.
Likewise, when people care about "free speech" for right-wing hate
groups and neo-Nazis only, this is not about "free speech." They are
supporting free speech for *one* element of society only: that element
that believes it necessary and right to marginalize other cultures
through brute force.

The purpose of supporting this particular element of "free speech"
is to create an environment where these sorts of ideas are
discussed, accepted and pervasive. This is proven by the fact that
these same people have proven eager to decriminalize the use of
violance against anyone who would dare raise their voice in protest.

----------------

Of course, this technique is another example of politicians attempting
to re-brand movements which has rightly gotten a bad
reputation. Unfortunately, politicians of all stripes have habitually
lied and obfuscated to make their supporters look and feel good about
themselves. Ergo, it is much more flattering to talk about voters with
unpopular, immoral beliefs regarding race by saying their supporters
are "under attack for political correctness" and that "their free
speech is threatened." If a politician came out and said "I support
the right of my constituents to make speeches in favor of ethnic
eliminationism and reconstitution of the Jim Crow laws," at least they
would be truthful about what they're doing. But of course, their
supporters don't want that much truth aired about their
beliefs. (Quite odd, considering such people frequently vote for
politicians who clam to "tell it like it is.")

Unfortunately this is one example among many. I heard one "public
intellectual" (note use if irony quotes) say he supported politicians
who were "strong supporters of the rule of law." When I and other
normal people hear that, I think "Oh, I agree, no one in America is
above the rule of law, and an impartial court system is necessary for
the proper exercise of government functions!" But unfortunately, this
so-called intellectual wasn't talking about rule of law at all - they
were talking about controlling illegal immigration. Ironic, given that
being in the country or working illegally isn't even misdemeanor
classifications, and is a violation more akin to not filing your workman's comp
correctly. If it was really about respect for law, then
we would have a strong push to ensure businesses use eVerify, an
extremely straightforward, easy to use program that ensures new employees have
proper authorizations to work in minutes. But in general, enforcement is so lax
(this is
typical)[https://www.texastribune.org/2017/06/15/e-verify-enforcement-and-expansion-comes-short/]
that one suspects the problem is not the fact these immigrants are are working
illegally, but the fact that if they become legal, they get extra
rights that make them just as expensive to hire as the "normals" - and
with the granting of legal status, say bye-bye to day laborors eager
to hang sheetwall for $7/hr or nanny your kid for $9/h for 11-hour
stretches.

Likewise we have all sorts of terminology meant to, essentially, lie:
"pro-family" instead of anti-gay, "pro-choice" instead of
pro-abortion and "pro-life" instead of abortion-proscription, "law and
order" instead of being in favor of suspending due process in
minority communities, "medicaid for all" instead of guaranteed
government health care... the list goes on. Some of this may be termed
as "branding," but the essense is to mislead - isn't that lying?

People always complain about politicians lying. But it seems it is
very popular to have politicians _lie on our's behalf_. If one is
feeling judgemental about people you fell insufficiently patriotic,
think about the politicians you like. If you like them because they do
all your lying for you so you don't have to defend your beliefs in
polite company, then they're also lying when they describe you
as patriotic.
