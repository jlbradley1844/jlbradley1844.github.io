#About That Memo at Google That Had Everyone Talking

A few weeks ago everyone was talking about this. Being in technology,
I figured I'd address it.

I don't like writing
about politics. I don't like talking about politics. This in spite of
my interest in it. For one, doing so is [kinda-sorta against my
beliefs](http://bahaiblog.net/site/2012/09/6-reasons-to-steer-clear-of-partisan-politics/). But
mainly, it's for the same reason I don't talk about religion much in
spite of my fervent interest - those with the strongest opinions
always seem to be the loudest, the most obnoxious, and the most
ill-informed. Wading into such conversations is a bit like going into
a hunting convention in a deer costume. Nobody with half-a-brain would
shoot at you, but you could get shot at just the same.

I've read the screed and had to spend some time time trying to figure
what the hubub was about at first.  I must say it wasn't obvious at
first blush; unlike most writings espousing viewpoints against
affirmative action, it's actually written with respect for the reader,
someone who bothered to footnote their sources. It isn't written with
the usual dirtbag attitude that normally accompanies antifeminist
rants. I suppose some people think that in itself should entitle one
to a hearing, although in reality that's the LEAST you can do to sell
your viewpoint to others.

In any case, that's the only good
thing that can be said about it.  The actual content is a tenditious
piece of research, the goal of which is to try to eliminate efforts to
bring more women into the technology workforce. I do think most of the
criticisms against were over the top and ludicrous (to use someone
else's words: [" piling onto one problematic software engineer as a
stand-in for a whole system of oppression is a distraction from [your]
larger
goals"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-google-memo-isnt-the-interesting-part-of-the-story/2017/08/11/de3f8876-7ecb-11e7-9d08-b79f191668ed_story.html?hpid=hp_no-name_opinion-card-d%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.1dd609fb5d24)).
But that being said, his memo doesn't hold up, and the context is totally wrong
(I'll get to that later).

In my opinion, the only point in the guy's favor - and it's a big
one - is that he wrote on an open forum where there was an _implicit
presumption that all ideas were on the table_. It does a company little
good to have such a forum and then after-the-fact fire somebody based
on their operation in a forum where there seemed to be an implicit
guarantee that all ideas are on the table! I've heard the author is
attempting legal remedies. In a normal situation, I'd say the guy has
no case; but if he does, it will be for this reason and this reason
only. In which case, the rightness or wrongness of his missive is
really beside the point. The unfortunate end game for American
corporations is clear - no company of any size is going to ever
support any such open-speech forum EVER, for fear that neo-nazis will
pile in and force companies to either censor speech or allow it and be
seen as siding with nazis.

Meanwhile, the discussions I've seen are missing some crucial context
- context it's defenders seem naively bereft and detractors have not
bothered to eduate anyone about; a wasted opportunity, given that
their main enemy has been the shield of obliviousness surrounding the
tech world on this issue. I'm not trying to defend the current
situation. I'm just stating some facts that everyone is ignoring,
because, you know, they would much rather support "their side."
*GROANS*

First of all, part of the hubub is the fact that the CEO loudly defended this
firing. Do you think this might have had to do anything with the fact
that
[Google
is preparing to defend themselves AGAINST A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR
DISCRIMINATORY PAY](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/lawyer-prepping-suit-google-wage-disparity-article-1.3396128)??? Naaaah I'm sure this action has NOTHING to do
with that at all.</sarcasm>

Let's be clear about HR departments like the one that removed the
author: they really don't exist to support development of resources.
That's what they WANT to do. But what they HAVE to do is
MAKE SURE THE COMPANY DOESN'T GET SUED. And having a situation where
tons of employees are passing around a paper saying "the reason we
don't have enough women is because most of them just aren't built
suitably to work at Google" really really REALLY makes the job of
lawsuit-proofing the company quite difficult.

The central fact, from an HR point of view, is that this employee
committed the most impolitic career move anyone has done this year by
putting his employer in an absolute no-win situation. Imagine what
would have happened if, instead of quoting a bunch of evolutionary
psychologists to defend a lack of women at the company, he had instead
[started quoting guys like
these](https://www.amazon.com/Bell-Curve-Intelligence-Structure-Paperbacks/dp/0684824299/)
to defend the fact there are so few African-Americans at Google. Well,
no one did, even though I'm sure some people at Google think that
way. Because they know IF THEY DID THEY WOULD GET WALKED OUT THE DOOR
BY HR IMMEDIATELY. And that, of course, is the whole point - someone
evidently did the exact same thing with women and yet he and many
others are shocked he basically got the same response! Please keep in
mind that the author's name was attached to this statement, and he had
women co-workers who no doubt reading it knowing it was him. And he's asking
his employer to stand by his right to circulate this statement while
it faces lawsuits on that very issue. Doesn't that seem, in hindsight,
to be a little dim? This is what one set of career-advice podcasters
have entertainingly referred to as a "career-limiting move."

Another related point is that we don't have the whole story here. It
was said to have gone "viral"; we don't know if this was a result of
people spontaneously passing this stuff around, or it was part of an
orchestrated campaign by a lot of ticked off alt-righters in Google,
perhaps including the writer themselves. The fact that this was
immediately picked up by the outside press and the author has seem so
happy to throw his lot with alt-righters makes one wonder if the whole
thing was a setup. But whether it was spontaneous or orchestrated, HR
at Google has a right to be pooping their pants. If it was due to a
loosely orchestrated campaign, they have to fire not only him, but
find whoever was the ringleader because of said class-action
lawsuits. And if it was all spontanous, HR has a *real* problem, and
they might start putting together that settlement fund now and get
ahead of the curve.

The last part is my anti-partisan screed, and perhaps the whole point
of why I wrote this rather than ignoring this.

Many conservatives (and it seems to be mostly conservatives that have
taken much umbrage at the firing) make much of the fact that the
writing itself is written respectfully and is reasearched (look, with
actual footnotes!), as if that alone should buy some respect. All good
for normal, reasonable argumentation, as I've mentioned. But again,
this is the _minimum_ a conscientious person would do to defend a
controvertial position. Ironic, considering this low bar is propounded
by a political philosophy whose adherents continually complain about
the "everybody gets a trophy" attitude in society;\.

An additional problem is that if you want to support a controversial
argument like this, you would do best to insist that the argument
stand alone and on its merits. You don't tie it to something else that
is also controversial. The author did the exact opposite, spending
just as much time in the writing complaining that Google's culture was
"oppresive" to conservative viewpoints. Indeed, much of the document
is spent discussing the need to encourage tolerance of open
discussions of conservative viewpoints.

If openly talking politics at work is considered good policy, _that's
news to me_. Not talking about politics, religion or money has been
considered "Career Management 101" for as long as the modern
corporation has been in existence. But instead, this author treats
this as some sort of novel imposition by the technology, and bolts a
controversial anti-diversity argument part and parcel to it. The
impression left is that the author seems to insist it is his viewpoint that
deserves special consideration in the name of "tolerance."

Worse yet, let's be blunt about this: if you write as representing a
political view, you have already framed your argumet in terms that
will predjudice large numbers against you. There are a large number of
people who do not who do not buy into a conservative world view; in
scientific and engineering communities, such people are legion. As
soon as you make it a partisan argument NOBODY WHO ISN'T ON YOUR SIDE
IS GOING TO GIVE YOU A "WIN." Indeed, identifying yourself as a
partisan is enough to be taken by many people as a sign your argument
is driven by a desire to "win" for "your side," truth be damned. So
arguments from a partisan viewpoint are generally regarded with
immeasurably more skepticism that those from a dispassionate
viewpoint. If the writer was unaligned politically, one might be
tempted to regard the employee as generally curious but politically
clueless in his offense of the bulk of his female co-workers. But the
minute the writer self-identifies as conservative, the image one gets
of the writer is someone who is probably the real target of those boring HR
diversity lectures, but who didn't listen because he spent the
whole time daydreaming of arguments to "put them libtards in their
place."

Finally, people
backing this writing should honestly look at things from other
people's peoint of view and understand exactly what other people get
from giving you a hearing. If a woman agreed that there are legitimate
concerns being adressed by the writer, would _he_ in turn be prepared
to acknowledge the real concerns women have with work environments,
and even acknowledge their need for a more respectful environment? Or
would his attitude be that women should just "suck it up and not be so
sensitive" becase he's right and she's wrong? If you're dealing with a
political partisan, you're going to expect the latter - meaning the
only people you're going to engage are those itching for a fight.

I should say that whenever someone identifies himsel as a progressive,
liberal, socialist, whatever I DON'T TRUST THEM EITHER. PEOPLE WHO
ADHERE TO A PARTISAN AGENDA ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED. It is one thing to
say "I have some conservative beliefs." It is another to identify oneself
as a conservative, particular if one claims some sort of special
status for oneself as a _protected group_. Do you feel aggreived?
Welcome to the club.
