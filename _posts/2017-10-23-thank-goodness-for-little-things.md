# The Start of Something Better Is Still Better

The news is suddenly full of sexual harrassment claims against
powerful men. This is sudden and unusual. What is sudden is the fact
that so many mainstream media providers (I'm using that descriptively, not
perjoratively) have suddenly noticed that this is a terrible
problem, it is going on, and it is newsworthy. What is unusual is the
fact that many of these incidents are not breaking news. Allegations
against most of these people go back a very long time and are easy to
corroborate. It seems as though somehow there is a shift from an
attude of casual acceptance of a horrible status quo to an attitude
that this is a problem. Suddenly, it is necessary and right to remove
offendors from positions of power where they can do further damage.

There are fair number of what one would call "social critics," people who
have written about this issue and are now
suspicious of the sudden timing of this. A few are sad, lost souls who
think this is a conspiracy to remind everyone about proven
allegations against political figures and media figures they might
favor. But most critics are wondering why it took so long to
acknowledge this was a problem. May of these critics, indeed, are the
same longform journalists that published airtight cases against these
powerful figures years ago, only to have their reports ignored or
roundly minimized; this in the same mainstream press that is now eager
to report these allegations. Such critics, therefore, are right to be
suspicious that this represents any significant, positive shift in attitude in
society.

To which I would reply: this is the start of something better. While I
agree with you that it is only a start, I think it's worth
acknowledging that it is still something better.

A few weeks I started doing a study about virtues and character
development - mainly aimed at bettering myself, since I'm in no
position to advise others. In any case, it reminded me of some work
Lawrence Kohlberg did regarding social morality.

In his writings, most people are described at being a level of
"conventional morality" in their moral thought.  Of these most,
probably the plurality of all grown adults, follow the more mature,
"norm-driven" morality. Such people are not philosophically
sophisticated in their ethical thought. However, they can recognize
that laws are necessary for the good of society, and that
additionally, there are also fixed norms that should be enforced, if
not through laws. The acceptance of laws and norms by this group as a
whole determines whether society as a whole enforces these norms or if
they become disregarded with resignation and an attitude of
"it stinks, what can you do."

A perhaps smaller group are also at a stage of conventional morality,
but just below them. In this stage, people look to their own social
group as a measure of morality. Such people are liable to look at
right and wrong simply on the basis of what their peers and friends
say is right or wrong. They may not understand the need for laws and
norms, regarding them as improper or "unenforceable" if not accepted by
their own group. However, such people are susceptible to the norms of
the society as accepted by those acting under the more mature
norm-driven moral framework above them, if only through peer pressure.

And finally, under that level, are the preconventional moralists.
Kohlberg is quick to label this as a "stage," since children pass
through this stage in their own development. However, there are a fair
number of individuals who are arrested in this stage of
development. This is the stage of the transactional moralist and
sociopath, for whom good and bad is a matter of whether one can get
away with something or not. In general, such people are too
undeveloped to understand the need for norms and laws, which they
regard as moralizing nonsense for the weak. But they do understand the
level of morality just above them, that regards social cues as the
arbiter of moral behavior. They understand this not because they
themselves believe, this, but because it serves as a constraint on
what they believe they can get away with among their peers.

Here is what I believe is going on in the case of sexual
harrassmet. We are seeing is the beginning of a change in socially
enforced norms. We have seen this many times before. In the sixties,
social norms changed around notions of explicit white supremacism,
going from tolerance to disapproval. In the eighties, the same thing
happened with drunk driving. In the last decade, this happened with
gay rights. And now we as a society are moving away from tolerating
sexual harrassment as an inevitable feature of society to something
that must be acted against.

This group most powerfully affects by these change of thoughts are the
group in the lower middle - those who look to their peers as arbiters
for right and wrong. Why? Because even if they hang out among a
particularly venal crowd, they'll still have a number of friends whose
beliefs are driven by norms. In addition, they're as exposed as
everyone else to the clutural zeitgest. If everyone on their favorite
TV channel says that this is a big deal and it has to stop, they will get
the cue from those messengers that maybe it has to stop.

As a result, things go from being "wrong but tolerated" to "wrong, and
not tolerated" among the masses.

Even those without a conscience will learn from their social
group. They won't be convinced of of the wrongness of this sort of
thing - unless somehow they themselves are negatively affected by a
particular incident. But their friends will clue them in. As a result,
they will at the very least keep it on the "down low," and may even
reign in their own behaviors if they begin to fear sanction from those
the interact with.

So in a sense, nothing has changed - what used to be wrong is still
wrong. But there is a wider recognition of the fact by people who
otherwise don't give a whit about good or bad, and simply go along to
get along. And when those attitudes change, everything can change.
