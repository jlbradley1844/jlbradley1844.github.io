# Personal Development as Virtuous Habits

Who among us doesn't want to be a better person?

As I'm writing this, the New Year's has passed some several weeks
ago. That means resolutions. It's a common cycle; in the run-up prior
to New Year's, just as people are tired of fluff Christmas articles in
the glossy magazines, websites and papers, there will be a spate of
articles about how to make your resolutions stick.

And many of us will do it; we will make resolutions and attempt to
stick to them. Vegetables will be purchased, gymns will be joined,
people will put "swear jars" on their desks. Office workers will go to
work earlier, and leave earlier to be with their families. And if
you're a regular gym rat, you'll noticed that the gym floor and
aerobics classes are suddenly overflowing.

Then there are various other resolutions people have - perhaps more
meaningful, but far more difficult to make progress on on. Those
involving self-improvement of personality or ethics. People telling
themselves they'll be kind, or that they'll keep their temper in
check. Married men or women who tell themselves they'll improve
attention to their partner, or vow to be a more thoughtful parent to
their kid. While not visible to us, these are the struggles that many
people hope to meet with their resolutions.

And what will be the result of all of these resoltuion?

This being a blog, I'll follow everyone's lead and draw a sweeping
conclusion from an isolated personal experience. I'm an irregular gym rat,
and I work out maybe two times a week and have done so for years.  I
dread the coming of January. Why? Resolutions! By the second week of
January, the locker room is twice as full, the floor hardly has any
room, and the classes are at overflow capacity.

If these resolutions were working, gym would be be miserable year-round.
But I've learned over the years that by mid-February,
things will be back to the way they were. Most of these resolutions
will have failed.

Oddly, my guess is this particular resolution is one of the easiest
ones you could possibly keep. Here's how you do it:

1. Create a workout schedule schedule.

2. Drop things from your schedule that would compete with this.

3. Just do it.

Yet the attendance trends tell the truth - most of these resolutions
won't work out. Even for those who aren't already overscheduled.

What about the efforts to become a better person? To improve one's
relationships? To be kinder, or more assertive, or reach out more
often? Aren't these even more important? They're even harder to
keep. Those aren't instances where one can simply schedule in time to
go to the gym, or buy something and use it before you go to bed.

Unfortunately, when trying to stick to these sorts of resolutions, the
plan most people have is to _try_. Try to be a better person. Try to be more
honest. Try to think of others. *Try*.

What are the odds that's going to work out?

If the only plan you have is to _try harder_... that isn't quite a plan. Here
is the first time (and hopefully the last) where I quote from Star
Wars:

	"Do, or do not. There is no try."   -- Yoda

Without a plan, a self-improvement resolution is forgotten as quickly as
 an uplifting epigram from a fortune cookie. It will last as
long. And unlike the resolution, one doesn't feel guilty when one realizes
they forgot what your fortune cookie said.

No, the problem is there is no plan. _Try_ is not a plan.

Given that, it's reasonable to ask: "Aren't there plans for these
things?" Indeed, it isn't as if self-improvement is a new idea.

## Virtue is What You Want

Supposing someone has a resolution like so:

    "I will try to be a better person this year."

If you're an MBA or planner, or a psychologist, this will drive you
nuts. As a goal, it's overly-broad, hard to measure, and not easy to act on.
But the impulse is basically a good one. It should be possible to help
oneself get better overall, even if just a little. Perhaps there is
more precise way of stating this? One is really 
thinking about a set of character strengths or
virtue that they wish to improve. 

My suggestion is this: someone who wants to be a better person is
really saying he or she wishes to be more *virtuous*. This has a broad
connotation that is generally understood. So let's modify the resolution:

    "I will try to be a more virtuous person this year."

Some may object, as "virtue" has a somewhat religious connotation, and
is frequently bound up with such ideas as spirituality, holiness,
purity, belief and such things. But when someone says they want to "be
a better person," they usually aren't thinking of that. One can
certainly become more kind, loyal, forgiving; less wrathful,
stressed-out or jealous; and one should not need to conscript with
religious doctrine that may have little to do with that. If someone who
wants to be more forgiving, the effort should be on improving that -
not on telling them they need to "bring Christ into their life" or
"get in touch with their fifth chakra." Unfortunately, this advice is
usually aimed at helping the advice-giver with their own problems
(e.g. a religious edit to "testify" to strangers), not to actually
help someone else with their actual problem.

The solution lies with the classical definitions of virtue. From the
Greek philosophers to the enlightenment, the term "virtue" was applied
to positive features of character worth cultivating. If one wants to
"be a better person," this is almost certainly what one thinks of.
And many have written on how to cultivate this sort of virtue and
improve it, all without prescribing compliance with unrelated
religious doctrine.

Aristotle may not have invented the concept of virtue, nor perfected
its definition. But in his great work _Nicomanchean Ethics_, he has
given one of the most useful conceptualizations of virtue. I find it
particularly useful exactly because it is untethered from any
particular spiritual tradition.

One important principle is Aristotle explains is that goodness in
general is identical with moral goodness and wisdom:

   "... virtue is not merely a state in conformity with the right
   principle, but one that implies the right principle; and the
   right principle in moral conduct is prudence."

In other words, goodness in a person _is_ virtue, and moral goodness
flows out of these virtuous actions. Aristotle defines this virtue as
being the prudent golden mean between two extremes. While one may
agree or disagree with his definition, the ideal of good conduct and
virtuous conduct as being identical should ring true for anyone
wishing for self-improvement.

When people discuss virtues, it is pretty frequent for them to
enumerate long lists of specific virtues. There is [Aristotle's own
list](www.cwu.edu/~warren/Unit1/aristotles_virtues_and_vices.htm) and [the seven classic
virtues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_virtues) and
[lists for kids](https://www.virtuesproject.com/virtuesdef.html)
and [one based in psychology
research](https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/classification-character-strengths-virtues/)
and [even some for
businesses](https://www.monster.ca/career-advice/article/50-personality-traits-for-the-workplace-canada)
and if this is what two minutes of Googling can get me, I can imagine
what the reader can do for his or herself. The important thing is that
virtuous behavior and things that are thought to be virtuous are
well-known and defined. Much as people argue about it, there is wide
agreement here.

## "OK Great, So What's Virtue, Really?"

But what distinguishes someone who is virtuous? What is the difference
between wanting to be kind, and actually being a kind person? Someone
who knows it's important, versus someone who embodies it?

It is the person's habits. A virtuous person is one of whose habits
are of a virtuous nature. Aristotle, again:

   "Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act
   rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have
   those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do.
   Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit."

Want to be a "better person"? It requires acquiring the habits of a
"better person."

Easy, right?

You may suspect that comment is sarcastic. Everyone knows habits are hard to
change. Everyone knows someone who has been trying to give up
cigarettes, or trying give up a Ben & Jerry's habit, or trying to cut
back on time on Facebook. Habit changing is hard.

But at least habits _can_ be changed; they are not a fixed part of
your personality. Look at the two resolutions below, and see which one
is better:

  "I will try to keep my temper in check and swear less."

  "I will develop the habits necessary to keep my temper in check."

The first one has the weasel word I picked on above - "try". This
resolution is almost certainly doomed; one cannot measure a "try," and
one can easily convince oneself after a few weeks of failure "well, at
least I tried." Worse that, if one does, he or she might draw the
depressing conclusion that having tried and failed, this failure is a
fixed, unchangeable part of their personality after only a few hobbled
attempts at change.

But consider the second one. It is more likely to result in
a substantial change.

Unfortunately, it is going to require a lot more work.

At this point, you may think: why does it need to be a habit? Can't it
just be a case of being more mindful and not acting automatically?
Isn't it just a case of more resolve and willpower? A habit implies an
unthinking reaction, right?

This is a tempting thought - that habit formation is all about
willpower. All of us like the idea that we have "free will," and if we
want to form or break a habit, it's just a case of bringing more will
to bear. This is the underlying appeal of those who think
self-improvement consists of just "trying harder." The thinking goes
that breaking a habit just consists of recognizing the situation,
thinking about it, not doing the bad habit, and choosing to do something else.

Unfortunately, if that is your attitude, you might win a battle here
or there but will almost certainly lose the war.  Like it or not, _the
bulk of actions that all of us take are habitual and done without
thinking_. Indeed, if it weren't for our habits of behavior, we would
be so overwhelmed we wouldn't be able to make it out the door in the
morning. And most decisions one makes are made _before one even
becomes aware the decision has been made_. You rely on habits for an
enormous repertoire of behavior. It is impractical to try to use will
to power through an entire day of actions, making deliberate choices
the whole time - it would require slowing down time, if not reversing it!

So anyone who wants to be a better person will have to form the habits
of a better person, difficult as it is. And indeed, I suspect this is
one reason Aristotle's virtue ethics is making a comeback, as
Aristotle sees virtues as habits. It isn't because everyone agrees
with Aristotle's framework. It's more likely that ethics has
been viewed as a problem of education and proper decision-making for a
very long time - but most ethical decisions are made on-the-fly,
without thinking, without any time for deliberate decision-making.

So hopefully I've impressed upon you that becoming a better person
requires creating habits in you that will make you be have better -
and those habits are what make you a better person.

So what does it take to form a habit?


## How to Start with Habits

Suppose you want to be a better person, and you have a specific
behavior in mind that you would like to cultivate. So this isn't a
vague longing - you have an issue in mind you would like to
address. How would one start?

You probably know that breaking bad
habits and creating good habits is hard. However, doing so is
possible, and even more fortunately, the process has been studied very
well. Psychologically, we know a lot about habit formation. To
this end, I am heavily referencing Charles Duhigg's _The Power of
Habit: How We Do What We Do in Life and Business_. I highly recommend
this book.

Of course, knowing how to create a habit is nothing if you don't know
what good habit you need to create! For this, I'm going to borrow an
idea from business literature. It has to deal with goal-setting. I'll
skip over the background and just dive straight in. To be achievable,
a goal should be SMART:

  *Specific
  *Measureable
  *Achievable
  *Realistic
  *Time-oriented

While SMART analysis is intended for goals, not habits, it is possible
to use them to evaluate those habits you wish to adopt. That will
ensure your habits are really about actions you can perform, not fuzzy
and unrealistic goals. So "becoming a better person," while salutory,
doesn't make for a SMART habit. "Call my parents and siblings at least
once a week, even when I'm angry at one of them" is such a resolution.

Let's take one from my life. Here is one I'm presently working on. I
originally started with a vague longing of the person I'd like to be
at work:

    "I would like to be much more agreeable and easy to approach; I
    would like to avoid being seen in a bad mood."

This is all well and good, but it is not specific enough to work
on. To be effective, we need to pick one bad habit we have that fits
into this framework, and replace it with a good habit. Bad habits are
never eliminated, just replaced with good habits. So what are specific
things to work on from the above? For me personally, it means
 * Smiling more often
 * Not acting so intense
 * Not swearing under my breath at the computer
 * Be more available to others and more proactively helpful

There's too much to unpack here to be useful. Probably, all of them
are worth doing. Rather than doing all of them at once, it would be
better if I handled one thing at a time. Let's do this:

 * Not swearing under my breath at the computer

I'm a software developer, so this sort of comes with the territory -
when I had a private office, I would be swearing, period. But since I
work in a [*cough*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494413000340#fig1) [open office plan](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-open-office-trap), this behavior is disruptive and
offputting to some. So I need to address it, by replacing this action
with something else:

 * When stressed at work, I will disengage from whatever I'm doing

Well, that's better. Sort of. It could be a bit more concrete.

 * When I feel like swearing, I will step back from the computer

Here we go: a SMART habit, specific and achievable. This
may be as good as I want. If this proves a tough habit to break,
perhaps we can make it measurable and start ratcheting it down.

So, now that we have a habit, a few hints:

* Didn't I have a bunch of things I wanted to do? Yes, I did. But I
don't have to tackle them all at once! It's reasonable to expect that
given several weeks, I can tackle one habit and move onto the next
one. There is an oft-repeated factoid that it took 21 days to form a
habit, but that's been widely debunked. Personally, I'd recommend at
least a month for something to stick before moving one's focus onto
something else.

* In the case of a bad habit, it is often recommended to start by simply
noting how often you perform the habit. That brings your awareness to
the habit. So for instance, in this case, I could just put tick marks
on a post-it. Supposing, then, that I found out I'm averaging 30 such
incidents a day. I can set goals based on that - for instance "I will
swear no more than 3 times a day by the end of this month." Now you
have a new habit, along with the SMART criteria to go with it.

* There is one particular challenge you've noticed - if you want to
be a better person, there are probably dozens of things you want to
change! Indeed, if you look at list of virtues, there usually aren't
just four or five of them - most list dozens of distinct things! You
can probably think of dozens of things you'd want to improve on. What,
then, do you do about having so many of them?

For this last point, wouldn't it be ideal to find some habits that
would take care of a lot of things at once? There are. Charles
Dughigg's work refers to these as "keystone habits". And it turns out
that for becoming a better person, there are such keystone
habits. These are habits consistently
recommended in what I'd call "wisdom literature": the
writings of classical philosophers and religious founders that are focused on
making one a better person. Identifying these habits is the goal of
the next blog post.
