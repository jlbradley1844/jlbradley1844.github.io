# The Keystone Habits of Virtue

Charles Duhigg's _The Power of Habits_ notes that not all habits are
equal in terms of impact. He notes that many businesses have
particular habits called "Keystone Habits." These are good habits
enforced throughout the company - habits so good that they
dramatically improve the conduct of business and themselves make it
easy to adopt other good habits.

Given all that has been written about virtue, one would think that
there are keystone habits for becoming a better person. And that would
be correct!

Let's set-aside the advice of the most popular self-help books; there
isn't a lot of uniformity there, and much of it is based on
unscientific pop-psychology. Unfortunately, once one sets those aside,
what is left is heavy, rigorous-sounding scientific books. While I may
favor those, they usually don't have much in the way of concrete
recommendations.

But virtue has been concern at least since Aristotle wrote about it -
certainly even longer. There is an enormous amount of advice in wisdom
literature on the clutivation of virtue. And certain habits come up
again and again as worth cultivation:

1. Contemplation and Thought
2. Self-Examination and Reflection
3. Meditation
4. Prayer

Not all of these are recommended by all writers - but at least one or
two is held as a central habit by all of them.  Let's take a look at these,
in turn. In some cases, the distinctions between these categories may
seem a bit fuzzy ("Isn't self-examination and meditation the same?"
you might be thinking), but if you look at exactly what the great
thinkers and teachers recommended, what each represents is quite
clear.

### Contemplation and Thought

How does one even know what the virtues mean? How does it relate to
your life? What does it mean to be "good"? These are the sorts of
questions one must think about to apply this to one's life. The great
philosophers spent much of their time, well, in philosophy.  That is,
in rigorous thought. Likewise, great spiritual leaders set aside much
time for thought and contemplation, not just prayer.

    Happiness, then, is co-extensive with contemplation, and the more
    people contemplate, the happier they are; not incidentally, but in
    virtue of their contemplation, because it is in itself
    precious. Thus happiness is a form of contemplation.
						-- Aristotle

    It is better to spend one day contemplating the birth and death of
    all things than a hundred years never contemplating beginnings and
    endings.
						-- The Buddha

    An hour’s contemplation is better than a year’s adoration.
                                      	     	-– Muhammad


    Philosophy is the stray camel of the Faithful, take hold of it
    wherever ye come across it.
						-– Muhammad

However, the idea of spending time in "contemplation and thought" is
too often confused with undirected naval-gazing and
rumination. Likewise, the term "philosophizing" is frequently confused
with verbal jousting and sophistry; in many cases, a desire to obscure
the truth instead of search for the truth. And contemplation may be a
cover for a desire to "space out" and do nothing:

      God deliver me from people who are so spiritual that they want
      to turn everything into perfect contemplation, come what may.
      	      		      	      		 -- Teresa of Avila

Obviously, the wrong sort of contemplation is of no help. What then,
is meant, by "thought" and "contemplation"? In my opinion, it is the
sort of directed thought, informed by knowledge and study, in which
the goal is to explicitly improve one's wisdom. That's why I included
the quote on philosophy - it is exactly the sort of contemplation
needed for understanding truth.

Contemplation is often thought of as airy-fairy and useless. But it's
an important part of your life. If I walk you
through a step-by-step guide to arc welding as shown in a YouTube
video, you are going to spend a great deal of time in thought and
contemplation ("What was that thing back there in step 11? Where am I
going to get this equipment? Don't I need a license for this, is it
even legal?") Just as contemplation is necessary if you
are looking an explainer on "how to use a chainsaw" and want to
keep your limbs attached to your body, it is also necessary if you
want to become a better person.

This sort of thought is acheived by reading what the great thinkers
have thought, actually thinking deeply about it, doing it on a regular
basis, and in some cases discussing this with others and testing what
we know through a common search for truth.

In hindsight, this is a bit obvious - you aren't going to learn
anything without studying and thinking about something, and virtuous
behavior is going to be the same. Obviously, reading about good
behavior isn't the same as carrying it out. And among a certain
personality, thinking about something, rather than barreling ahead
withoutout thought, is seen as weak and ineffective. But just because
something isn't sufficient doesn't mean it isn't necessary.

### Self-reflection and self-analysis

To introduce this subject, I present one of the most famous quotes in
all of philosophy:

    The unexamined life is not worth living -- Socrates (via Plato)

First, I'm being a little misleading here. This quote is not about
self-reflection, much as it would sound like. This quote, attributed
to Socrates by Plato, was spoken during the final trial of
Socrates. Socrates said it defending his decision to die rather than
to accept exile, which he was also offered; exile from Athens would
have interfered with his search for the truth.

But let's not let the actual facts get in the way of a good
story. This quote sounds like a call to examine one's own life, and we
can use it as such. And there are lots of other recommendations for
self-reflection and reflecting on one's actions. Also, while we're at
it, the statement of the Oracle at Delphi, which Socrates had said
triggered his search for truth, was

    Know thyself.

Plainly, if you wish to better yourself, you will need to gain a lot
of self knowledge. You will need to identify your bad habits. You will
need to identify what triggers those bad habits. You will need to
understand your strengths and how to leverage them. You may need to
understand certain subconscious motivations for why you do what you
do.

Indeed, underlying the whole field of psychotherapy is the
premise that if you better know yourself, you will be able to solve
your problems and bad behaviors. And if you are a big believer in
science, then you hopefully know that _some_ therapy techniques are
actually very effective. In particular, "rational
emotive therapy," which works by deliberately probing what your beliefs and
behaviors are, seems particularly effective.

Since acquiring virtue is, to some extent, a process of "fixing
yourself," this means examining yourself to see what is broken. In the
Baha'i Faith, this process of self-development is seen as "uncovering
the gems within." A therapist is not needed for this, though if you
have serious problems it is recommended.

So how does one gain self-knowledge? Well, I suppose you could dwell
and ruminate on your own faults, but that can quickly become
counterproductive. You will need some sort of method, but which one?
One of the oldest means of self reflection is to keep a diary or
journal. This is an old practice that is frequently
recommended. Personally, I find something about the process of writing
out one's thoughts that lead towards a deeper understanding. Once my
thoughts are on paper, I'm able to gain a perspective on my problems
and thoughts. Many problems I ruminated excessively on seem small and
inappropriate of deep thought when I read it back one week later from
the journal. Others items which I mention in passing turn out to later
give me important insights in my own behavior.

A lot can be gained on one's own here. However, it is important to
know when you should seek help. There are problems such as serious
addictions and psychological diseases that are too big to handle on
one's own. Many conditions (particularly depression) actually have
physical causes, which thwart the ability to will one's way out of
problems. Some of these may be caused by underlying diseases. So do
not take this article as saying in any way that psychotherapy is
unnecessary. Part of self-knowledge is knowing when to go to someone
else for assistance.


### Meditation

Apparently mindfulness(TM) is all the trend nowadays. This irks me a
little - I've been doing meditation for years and now, suddenly they
call it "mindfulness." I suppose I shouldn't be too curmudgeonly, but
it seems like a rebranding undertaken by enterprising Marketing MBAs where they
attempt to hide the obvious 
religious background of meditation in order to sell mindfulness
pillows and mindfulness mats and mindfulness apps and mindfulness
courses. If you have meditated before, you are no doubt aware that
meditation is easily taken up without the need for bringing home
dust-collecting tchotckes from the atheletic store.

But the word mindfulness(TM) as a marketing term is useful, in that it
implies a specific sort of process. In particular, it is a reinvention
of the Transcendental Meditation that became popular in the 1970s,
after being discovered in the west as a critical element of Buddhist
practice. Meditation, as a term, is so broad as to be useles - it
could mean undisciplined rumination too - and of course, "mindfulness"
is in itself just a term for paying attention. But mindfulness(TM)
means something specific. Western religions of course, have their own
spiritual traditions of meditation - or as one Baha'i told me "In
prayer you might talk to God, but in meditation God talks to you!" But
when a Buddhist talks about meditation (as in mindfulness(TM)), he
means a particular sort of thing, of a nature quite dissimilar to
meditation as understood in the West, which is closer to the studied
contemplation I describe above.

Mindfulness means a
distinct process, of emptying one's thoughts - generally so that
unhealthy ones can leave. In secular practices, this can involve
relief from anxiety, irrational thoughts, or anger. Outside of that,
it can be used to cultivate positive thoughts. This provides another
mechanism for making virtuous conduct more easily, by allowing us to
practice disengaging from the sorts of reactive behaviors that often
thwart attempts at virtuous conduct.

This is central to Buddhism, Hinduism, and other religions of the
orient. But western religions have their own equivalents. In
particular, the repititious prayers of Catholocism and Islam seem to
have the aim of clearing the mind and focusing it in much the same
manner.

### Prayer

Finally, we have prayer. This is the heavy lifter of the Occidental
religions. The great mystics and leaders of the Christian church wrote
much of the commentary on prayer and how to derive wisdom from it -
Theresa of Avila, Francis of Assisi, Thomas Merton. Islam has its own
Sufi traditions in which these practices are central.

Unfortunately the reputation of prayer has suffered in the popular
religion of the west. From childhood, many of us are taught - even
encouraged - to pray for _things_. This is unfortunately a reflection
of what popular culture thinks prayer is supposed to be, and reflects
even what some religious "leaders" tell us (irony quotes are
intentional). In the movies and television, if anyone prays, it's for
stuff. When it isn't for stuff, prayer is instead used as a
storytelling symbol - a shorthand for indicating someone is a brittle,
hidebound conservatism, or used for ham-fisted foreshadowing in a
horror movie.  Cultural studies presentations are no better; when we
are taught about ancient pagan religions, we are taught about things
like sacrifice and ritual and the prayers that accompanied them. The
prayers of modern believers is treated as qualitatively no different
than those of a pagan tribesman who wants a successful hunt. The
modern mystic is thereby rendered at the same intellectual level of an
illiterate nomad who never left the company of is tribe.

This is a grave misunderstanding that both robs prayer of its meaning
and its ability to actually help you. Prayer, as understood by the great
mystics, is nothing more and nothing less than "communion with God" and a
way of bringing yourself into the presence of the divine, whatever it
may actually be.

Of the four habits, prayer is the toughest to present as necessary, and
personally, it has been the hardest for me to work into my life on my own. This
is particularly tricky for those who are completely atheistic or who
have decided that any sort of belief system not based in science is
not worth exploring. The idea of being in touch with some unreachable
plane or entity floating in a parallel unknowable universe seems ridiculous to
such people, and attempts to force prayer as habit seem as ridiculous as
dressing up like a Jedi just so one can be in touch with The Force. So
I'm not going to force-fit this on anyone resistant.

However, for those of you who do believe, there is much pragmatic
advice from the great spiritual leaders. And much of its power has to do with
how you pray.

In the Baha'i Faith, common practice is to actually _not_ use
their own prayers. Rather, Baha'i use the prayers written by the
founders of the Baha'i Faith. These prayers are rarely prayers _for_
something, but when they are, they are for things such as virtues
(frequently referred to in their writings as "spiritual
qualities"). Indeed, The Lord's Prayer is itself a prayer for such
things; it certainly isn't a prayer for victory and wealth. And if you
trust biblical scholars on the history of the text in The Bible (I
do), then given what we know, it's one of the few passages such
scholars express high confidence that Jesus really said himself. It's
that important.

So my recommendation to the skeptical is to try it anyway. But
instead, stop trying to "pray from the heart" if you're coming up
empty; if it plainly isn't working for you. Instead, use the prayers
of others after carefully examining them, and be very picky. Start
being instrumental and pick writings that will improve you and
strengthing you, not something that will dull you with self-indulgent
affirmations. Once this is done, praying on a daily basis will seem
helpful instead of weird.

## Wrapping It Up

So forgive me for the length. To restate the core premise of this
post:

   A good person is someone with good habits. We call these good
   habits "virtues." Virtues are things one does without much
   conscious thought that leads one to be a better person.

To develop specific virtues requires specific habits. But there are
four keystone habits that have been identified in wisdom literature as
important for self-development:

   * Contemplation and thought
   * Self-reflection (self-analysis)
   * Meditation
   * Prayer

Seems like a lot right? Well, given a proper set of habits, it isn't
much trouble at all, and the benefits exceed whatever else you could
be doing with the time. Next, I'll discuss something one faith
tradition does that hits all these habits!
