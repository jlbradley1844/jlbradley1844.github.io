# Core Habits for Virtue Development: the Baha'i Model

I follow a spiritual path, and readers of this blog have probably
figured out I'm a Baha'i. So it's not much of a surprise that I would
present how things are done in the Baha'i Faith. Rather than dwell
upon salesmanship, I'd prefer to outline the core habits for virtue
development as practiced. Then you can decide whether this model makes
sense for you or not.

Why this model? I recommend it because it manages to hit all 4 core
habits just by virtue of existing Baha'i laws. On top of that, it is
not time consuming at all - perhaps less than a half-hour out of your
day. And many of the laws are posed in a way that make it easy to
integrate into your life as habits. You can practice this model
without being a Baha'i, or even particularly religious, though as I'll
later write, there are a lot of other things involved with practice of
Baha'i Faith that also improve virtuous character.

To recap, the 4 core habits, as I wrote earlier, are the following:

1. Reading and reflection on wisdom literature
2. Self-reflection and self-analysis
3. Meditation
4. Prayer

Let's dive in and see how these elements are present in the Baha'i
model.

## Reading and Reflection on Wisdom Literature

To recap, a core habit of virtue improvement is to inform oneself
about the nature of virtue. While one could do this by reading
psychology books, in the prior column I recommended instead reading
from "wisdom literature" - however you define it, but generally the
classic works from religious and philosophical figures that have
helped generations of people become better people. And after this
reading, think deeply about the reading. It needs to happen frequently
enough that this sort of stuff becomes part of your life - not just
for a few moments every weekend.

Well then, what does the Baha'i Faith say? It's clear enough, the writings say:

    Recite ye the verses of God every morn and eventide.

By "the versus of God," in the
Baha'i Faith this is generally thought of as the versus of the central
texts of the revealed religions. At least to me, the import is to get
one to read and think about holy writings twice daily. Now, this is a
religious law, so indeed this has a devotional component to
it as well. "Read ye the sacred verses in such measure that ye be not
overcome by languor and despondency." For purposes of this post
though, I'm going to ignore that, and concentrate on this as a habit
for personal development.

While "recite" implies that one might in theory read these versus out
loud without
understanding them a bit - like someone mumbling a prayer in latin or arabic
even though one doesn't know the language - Baha'i culture places such an
emphasis on understanding the Writings for oneself, that this use of
"recite" is not likely the case. The Baha'i figure Abdu'l-Baha was
particularly insistent that it is the duty of every individual to
independently investigate reality for oneself, and key among these is
making frequent reading of these writings a habit.

So twice daily, short readings to remind yourself about how to stay
good. Got it?

## Self-Reflection and Self-Analysis

Self-reflection is particularly important in self-improvement. It is
not possible to grow in virtue without some sort of frequent
self-examination. Indeed, studies of habits have shown that some bad
habits can be reduced by simply counting the number of times one does
it and then reviewing it at the end of the day. Simply increasing
one's self-awareness of this habit is sufficient.

As far as what the Baha'i Faith teaches, the following guidance does not appear
in the main corpus of Baha'i Laws (the Kitab-i-Aqdas), but I believe
it has an important application to one's struggle to be virtuous:

     O SON OF BEING!
     Bring thyself to account each day ere thou art
     summoned to a reckoning; for death, unheralded, shall come upon
     thee and thou shalt be called to give account for thy deeds.

As can be seen, the Godhead is rather uncompromising in such
situations. Having been given one life, it seems we are to make the
most of it. For purposes of the habits, I'm going to focus on thert
phrase "bring thyself to account each day." By simply bringing
oneself an awareness of the problem and how frequently one does it, it
is possible to make it less of a habit and more of a conscious action,
and making it conscious allows you to break it - or substitute a
better habit for it.

The form of this "reckoning" is vague, and since Baha'u'llah, the
writer of these versus, is silent on the matter, I don't feel
comfortable prescribing anything. However, one can think of a number
of ways to do this daily accounting - by actually talling what one has
done per some measures of your own devising, some sort of end-of-day
review of one's actions, or anything else. The key is to force daily
self-reflection and, one assumes, how one can do better the next day.

As far as how I have done it, I've begin doing journaling, the habit
of writing one's thoughts at the end of the day. Note, however, that
I'm not doing the stream-of-consciousness writing of a typical
"writer's journal"; instead, I'm using this as a means to force a
daily self-examination for purposes of becoming a better person. I use
a blank journal because I know if I try to do some daily review
mentally without having a pen in my hand, I have difficulty focusing
on the task for more than one or two minutes. But it's important to
say this is how I do it; there is no particular mechanism
prescribed. Journaling has its hardcore fans as a means of character
development, so I'm not alone in my use. The writers of [The Daily
Stoic](https://dailystoic.com/), a character-development blog I follow
dedicated toward (can you guess?) stoicism are particular fans of this
approach.

## Meditation

When discussing meditation, it is necessary to discuss what kind of
meditation is meant. There is, commonly, the meditation-as-contemplation
definition of the word. That is usful and necessary, but what is meant
here is the meditation-as-mindfulness - that is, meditation as
practiced in classical Eastern traditions.

The Baha'i Faith doesn't assign any laws on meditations and makes no
mention of mantras. There is no emphasis on proper techniques for
"mindfulness," and aside from a handful of prayers that prescribe
positions, no advice on form of meditation is given. But yet, there is
this, in the Kitab-i-Aqdas:

    It hath been ordained that every believer in God, 
    the Lord of Judgement, shall, each day, having washed 
    his hands and then his face, seat himself and, turning 
    unto God, repeat "Allah-u-Abha" ninety-five times.

This certainly looks like a mantra, and my experience is that it will
definitely allow you to enter a meditative state for a short time. If
you aren't a Baha'i, the phrase "Allah-u-abha" means "God is Most
Glorious." It's similar to the common Muslim greeting of Allah-u-Akbar
("God is Great"). Few Baha'is I know make the connection between this
activity and mantras. This may be because it only takes a few minutes
to do. But it's similar enough to be a distinction without a difference.

Such habits are more universal than one thinks, rather than being
distinctive to buddhism. Catholics who pray numerous
repetitions of the rosary, unaware that they are cultivating the same
mental state as meditating Buddhists. While no one could legitimately
claim these are identical experiences, they are still far more alike
than different. In any event, if you are developing your own habits,
the takeaway is that meditation can come in many forms and still be
effective. It is not necessary to [purge it of meaning until nothing
remains except a clinical medical procedure](https://www.thedailybeast.com/mindfulness-is-going-mainstream-because-of-science).

## Prayer

Finally we have this. Perhaps with the exception of perhaps some forms
of Buddhism particularly popular in the West, every religion recommends prayer.

In the Baha'i Faith, this comes in distinct forms.  First, like Islam,
there is an Obligatory Prayer. However, unlike Islam, it is said under
one of three different forms:

1. The Long Obligatory Prayer. This is a set prayer consisting of a
number of versus, with prescribed positions and prostrations. It takes
perhaps ten to fifteen minutes to perform. It is said once a day.

2. The Medium Obligatory Prayer. This is a prayer of about a dozen
versus, along with a few prescribed positions. It is said three times
a day: in morning, noon and evening.

3. The Short Obligatory Prayer. This is a short prayer of just three
sentences. It is said between noon and 4:00 PM.

Unusually, there is no guidance given whatsoever on which one to
choose. One is directed to simply pick _one of the three_. A
confession: I almost always say the short one.

What is the purpose of this prayer? Much like other modern religions,
the purpose is closeness to God. The prescribed versus have a number
of different themes, but the main theme is our insignificance relative
to the Godhead. Note that nowhere in the Baha'i Writings is it said
that the sole focus of prayer is developing virtues, and I do not mean
to portray that it does! Yet, if one
rules out any sort of discussions of "spirit world," "mystic forces,"
and other sorts of speculations, one is left with a practice that is
intended to remind us of our place in the world - as a rather small
part that is here to serve and assist others, not to glorify
ourselves.

Aside from the obligatory prayer, there is no obligation to pray. My
experience with other Baha'is is that they do pray otherwise, but
generally read prayers extracted from Baha'i writings rather than make
ones up on the spot.

As far as my own practice, I may do this and a few others, but my
nature is not one who is inclined to pray. Indeed, I had stopped
praying for years before I became a Baha'i, and had this form of
prayer not been obligatory, I might not be doing so consistently. The
Baha'i Faith teaches that one cannot know God - the only reliable
source of knowledge is through his/her/its Messangers - but my own
personal conception of God is much closer to Plato and Tillich's "God
of the Philosophers" than the "God is your best buddy who gives you
nice things" of Prosperity Gospel hucksters. That background has made
it harder to see the purpose of prayer, as prayer is so often
frequently understood as being roughly equivalent to sacrificing a
goat to appease the Harvest Gods, just more convenient and without all
the mopping and cleanup. Personally, I now read prayers exclusively
from the Baha'i Writings, and regard it as a form of
"self-programming" to help The Divine work through me.

## So, How Do You Make These Habits a Habit?

So, let's look at this. Supposing someone resolved to improve their
own behavior to be a better person and more virtuous. So much so that
they want to make this a habit. Well, what sort of habits do we need
with this regimen?

- About 20-30 minutes out of every day
- Creates a number of good habits
- Ensures we focus on our goals for self-improvement repeatedly
throughout the day 

What we have here is a regimen which could serve as an analog for the
"introductory physical workout" for virtue development. You wouldn't
take it as your sole regimen for self-improvement, just as you
wouldn't do stretching exercises for and warmups in lieu of a balanced
course of fitness. But it is prescribed course of action, so you don't
have to think about it too hard, and it should create an
immediate effect, if only by focusing ones thoughts on self-improvment
throughout the day. As such, for me these basic Baha'i
practices form the foundation of an "initial workout" for virtue
development.

So then let's presume you've picked this up and you're convinced this
is the platform you can use to become a better person. I don't have to
convince you and you _want_ to do this. So, you're just going to do
it, right?

Right?

--------------------------------------

I suspect you'll have the same experience I've had. You start off with
good intentions, and then in spite of everything, you will drift
off. When you ask someone about it, they might mutter something
encouraging and tell them they had the same problem, but just keep
trying. However, you may get less helpful advice - perhaps a
good-natured lecture about willpower, or someone of even more fanciful
nature telling you your old self is "resisting" corrections.

The trouble is really more straightforward - you won't stick to this
until you make it a *habit*.  How do I know? Because that's the
problem I had. If you want to do the same thing every day you need to
make it a habit. Anything else is hoping you'll be on your best
behavior every day. Yet you're trying to be virtuous because you
aren't on your best behavior every day!

So... how do you make it a habit?

### How a Habit Works

Here's where I dig up Charles Duhigg's work again (it won't be the
last time). In his book on habits, he notes that you need *three
things* to make a habit:

1. A cue
2. An action
3. A reward

You already know what the action is. But you might not have a cue. And
you almost certainly haven't thought of the reward.

How does a habit work in practice? What are the mechanics of the
habit? An example will help, and since it's easier to think of this in
terms of a bad habit. I'm going to break it down by discussing a bad
habit I used to have.

Several years ago, I drove to work. Meanwhile, the gas station I frequented
was right across from a Dunkin Donuts. I think you know how this
goes. One day fateful, when I had hurried out of the house without
eating breakfast, I crossed the street after
filling up and got donuts.

Over time, every time I filled up, I'd hop across the street to get
two donuts and coffee. Then I started doing it when I didn't need gas
but wanted to "reward myself." Suddenly, I was hitting it 2-3 times a
week.

I had a habit. A bad habit.

Let's see how this worked, per Charles Duhigg's cycle:

- The cue: initially the cue was "filling up my gas tank." (Over time,
  the cue became "leaving my driveway to go to work.")
- The action: pick up donuts and coffee
- The reward: eat donuts and drink coffee (donuts and coffee are its own
  reward, you see).

How did I break it? Well, I had a little help. I knew I wasn't going
to give it up completely. So I shifted my cue back to: "filling up my
gas tank ONLY." I stopped giving myself permission to detour, knowing
that I wasn't entirely giving up my habit, just cutting
back. Meanwhile, I made sure I ate a bigger breakfast so I didn't
leave the house starving. But the main help I had came several months
later when my old car fell apart: my wife and I were fortunate enough
to afford a new Prius. Suddenly my weekly fill-ups were every other
week - or less - making this infrequent enough that I was able to just
use willpower to go "cold turkey." Even then, I still did it once in a
while; it took a change in commute to drop it completely.

Note that I didn't set out to make this a habit, but once I started,
it developed a dynamic all its own. And to break that habit, I
couldn't just go cold-turkey - I had to modify both the reward and the
cue, and take actions to ensure the reward was less rewarding. Once I
did that, I was able to cut out the action.

So while I've outlined a number of virtuous habits, I was really being
misleading. What I really outlined was a number of virtuous
_actions_. To make these habits of your own, you'll need a cue and a reward.

### The Reward

When I talk about rewards, I'm talking about tangible things that
appeal to your lower nature, at least in some respect. I know what
you're thinking. "I know why I'm doing this, so I can be a better
person! Why do I need a reward? I'm not a five-year old kid who has to
be bribed!"

Unfortunately, habits don't work that way. You, gentle reader, as
virtuous as you wish to be, will not initially be picking up these
habits out of the rewards you get initially. Your brain won't
cooperate. You have two choices:

- Figure a way to make the action itself rewarding, or
- Pick another small way to reward yourself after
doing the action.

Sometimes the action itself is rewarding, depending on your
circumstances. For instance, as a Baha'i following these habits, I do
the midday prayer and meditations sometime in the early afternoon,
when I need a break. By around 3:00pm, I'm feeling stressed, and
stepping away from my activities really helps. So the activity is,
itself, its own reward. So I've never had a problem establishing this
as a habit.

From Monday through Friday.

On the weekends, however, I'm busy with the kids. This means no break
in my schedule, but on the other hand, none of the normal stress I
feel during the work week. The intrinsic reward is less - and I have
difficulty keeping the habit up.

Likewise, doing a morning reading has proven tough; I'm used to doing
reading or writing on the train and that would displace what would
otherwise be a good habit. And I've had trouble keeping on readings
and some sort of end-of-day journal for self-examination. So the
intrinsic rewards aren't enough?

How then to do this? The solution is to _bribe yourself_. Why?

Some activites don't have the immediate payoff that is necessary to
make them a habit. Indeed, the only reason I say the daily prayer
without self-bribery is because I've done it over twenty years, and
have learned to enjoy it. Years prior to this, I was setting alarms
and calendar appointments to force myself to do it. I didn't know how
to create habits then, and because praying was not something I
enjoyed, it took me a very long time to enjoy it intrinsically. If
you're having trouble keeping on these habits, I suspect that's the
main reason; you don't have a payoff.

Contrast that with the donut habit. My guess is it took me only a few
months from doing it occasionally to doing it two or three times a week. Why?
BEAUSE IT'S DONUTS, MAN. I'm just glad it was a Dunkin Donuts shop,
and not a Krispy Kreme, or it would have become a daily habit that
would've require intense therapy and a prescription of
Chantix-for-Donuts to break. Bad
habits are easy to pick up because they're bad habits. Good habits -
like most virtues - require a while to appreciate, since the effects
are on a plane that is not conducive to immediate gratification.

So one way to take care of this is to do reward bundling. The bribe is
something enjoyable that you tell yourself you're going to do after
you complete the activity. This is your reward. It has to be something
you enjoy; it can't be _too_ bad for you. You want to be able to drop
it after your habits are set and you've outgrown the need for it.

So for instance, suppose you are in the habit of plopping down on the
couch because you're just too frickin' tired to do anything in the
middle of the day. You want to set time aside to read some of these
"deep thought" writings every day, and go through a mental review of
what your progress is and how you can improve. Here's one example: if
you've wanted to "catch up" on a show you really like, tell yourself
that you're going to watch one episode, but only after you do this
action. Odds are, you were going to do it anyway, but feel a little
guilty about it. Now you'll turn it into a reward for doing something
good. And by the time you get caught up on the series, you might be
well into a month performing this habit! Naturally, you could really
do anything else that you regard as a reward.

Also, if you have other good habits you want to start, you can do that
at the same time. For instance, there may be a certain habit you want
to do in the morning; e.g. wake up early. You could wake up early, do
the reading, and then do something as a small reward for keeping to
your new schedule. Perhaps... donuts.

### The Cue

A reward isn't all you need. To have a habit to do something, you need
a reminder. Something has to trigger your new habit. This trigger is
called a "cue."

In my bad habit, the cue was filling up my gas tank. Normally I didn't
pass directly by this Dunkin Donuts. Going one block out of my way was
all it took to get me thinking "well, while I'm here I might as
well..." For the good habit you wish to adopt, you probably don't
already have a cue, so you'll have to make one.

In my case, for my
obligatory prayer, my cue is (quite unfortunately) the
stressed feeling about two hours after lunch when I'm really tired
and need to push through two or three more hours of work. For my
morning reading, I'm trying to make it the minute I plop into the
train seat on my way to work. There are hazards to both of these - in
particular, neither will work on the weekends. A good cue will be as
consistent as possible. But both cases are simple.

Even setting an
alarm will do the trick. But don't forget the reward, and give it some
thought. If you set the alarm a time in your day when you're likely to
be busy, you'll start ignoring your alarm, and over time you'll begin
to ignore it without sleeping, like an alarm clock whose snoose button
is a little too easy to reach.

### Wrapping it Up

So, to briefly summarize: this column outlined a concrete plan, drawn from
the Baha'i Faith, that sets four keystone habits for improving your
own virtue and character. These activities are
- Brief readings from holy writings and reflections on them twice a day
- A brief time set aside for explicit reflection on ones' actions
during the day
- Short period of a time set aside for meditation (in this case, using
the Arabic phrase "Allah-u-Abha")
- At least one prayer specifically written for daily reflection.

The activites themselves do not make a habit; to make these habits,
the following are required:
* a cue
* the activity itself
* a reward
Those reading this who are Baha'is have the activities prescribed, but
those not Baha'is can choose these or other activities of a similar
nature; otherwise, the rest is up to you.

Just a warning before closing this lenthy column. These keystone habits
themselves probably aren't going to be all you need to do to make the
change you want. You probably have specific areas you want to work
on. And any Baha'is reading this know that there are many more things
suggested in the writings for improving oneself. Future columns will
discuss those.
