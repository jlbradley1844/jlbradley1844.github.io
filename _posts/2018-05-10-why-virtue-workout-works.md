# A Recap: Why Might a Virtue Workout Work

I have offered up a mechanism, based on what I and numerous others are
doing every day, that I think _should_ work. This was worked out by
careful study of classical philosophy, religious study, and the Baha'i
Writings. However, skeptical reader might still indeed
wonder _why_ it might work. What are the mechanisms by
which it might work?

Someone of more traditional religious indoctrication,
may believe this viewpoint is silly. "You're praying for X, God is
going to give you X if it's good for you, since you're praying for
something that's good for you you're going to get it! No?" Such a
thing may not convince many readers, and it certainly doesn't convince
me - and I'm religious! To this day I remain very skeptical of
"itercessionary prayer" as conceived by most religious people. Lacking
that mechanism, why would prayer actually help you? Indeed, why would
meditation or any of the other mechanisms help you?

If you're a Baha'i, even of the more skeptical bent, you would still
be onboard the program. Baha'is are more likely than most to believe
religious laws are intended to produce virtuous conduct and should be
interpreted towards that view. Indeed, it permeates their outlook on
religion, and their outlook on all religions, not just their own:

    ...the purpose of religion is the acquisition of praiseworthy
    virtues, betterment of morals, spiritual development of mankind,
    the real life and divine bestowals.
    -- Abdu'l-Baha (Foundations of World Unity, p. 15

However, if you're skeptical about prayer, you're probably skeptical
about religion too. So that sort of reasoning is unconvincing; you want hard
proof. How can one get it?

I confess I'm not well read on what the research is in this field; I'm
afraid of something doesn't made a splash in the science magazines and
blogs, I'm not going to read about it. Part of the problem is that
there is no measurement of a "better person." Should one propose one,
even the most common-sense definition is generally met with a loud
Lebowski-style declaration "Well that's just your opinion maaaaaan."
As such, even the most uncontroversial propositions for
self-improvement are rendered unprovable to critics.  One would think
that reading about virtue may make you more virtuous; likewise,
focusing on self-examination should help. But without emperical
evidence, it's just a claim. Notions of prayer in the scientific
community are particularly wrongheaded - rather than studying effects
on the person praying, scientists use primitive notions about
intercessionary prayer to show its uselessnes;
e.g. Templeton Foundation studies that study where people
pray for healing, or to grow beans in a pot. Not exactly what we want
to study for virtue development.

What about the other activities? Self-reflection and activities such
as diarying and study of the writings are a big part of
classically-based philosophies such as stoicism. Unlike prayer, these
are activities even the nonreligious can engage in, and such writings
have been treasured by Western culture for ages. But this in itself is
hardly proof - one can think of lots of age-old practices that were
dropped as wrongheaded and obsolete only decades ago, after hundreds
of years of acceptance. Without hard science, there is no assurance
this accepted wisdom is correct. 

What has been studied is mindfulness. This may be because of the
activities, this is the most easy to replicate. It consists of a
process, it makes specific claims about outcome, and you can easily
adapt it to secular ends. And while many scientists have tried to
debunk it, the worst they can say is while "the science is still out",
it does seem to have an effect. This particularly seems to be the case
with self-reported well being due reduction of anxiety.

So that's it: we have some sort of vague
consensus that meditation does tend to alleviate stress and deactivate
the sort of automatic stress responses that tend to make you a more
unpleasant and reactive person. Other than that, we're simply
left with a collection of techniques that have been tried and found
helpful to some, with no proof offerred. Leaving us with commonsense
reasoning, faulty as it is, as the only recommendation for these approaches.


----------------------------

Having left the comforting world of hard science and its certantiess,
how can we tell these techniques work? And why should one believe they
work?  After all, this requires an investment of effort and time, that
could just as easily be spent more enjoyably on Netflix.
To answer this, it is necessary to take a step back and see what is
happening when one is "trying to be a better person." If science does
show any of these programs of self-improvement have an effect, I'm
confident what the key behind its success is.

The key is self-reflection.

If one had zero capacity for self-reflection, then there would be no
drive to become a better person. Why? Because there would be no
identification of any flaws in one's behavior! Someone who wants to be
a better person has an inkling that something, somewhere, there is
something wrong with one's behavior. These realizations could take
many forms; let's think of some situations many of us have been in:

* You do something habitutally; afterward, you realize this was
  something you shouldn't have done and felt guilty about it.

* You run into a stressful situation that requires you to be patient
  and thoughtful; instead you lose your cool and later regret it.

* In response to a tough day at work, you pull up the phone to take
  your mind off of it. Before you realize it, it's hours later and
  you're feeling miserable after wasting your free time on Facebook
  again.

* A friend pulls you aside and says you did something rude or
  thoughtless. While at first you have no idea what he is talking
  about, part of you agrees on some level.

What is going on here? In all cases, one is made aware of some sort of
subtle lack of virtue or defect through reflection or feedback. But it all
cases, these are actions that one as performed _without conscious
decision_, where one later _regrets the action made_ earlier, or at
least wonders if it was inappropriate or unkind. Perhaps what is
happening is a bad habit - a vice, in other words - and one wishes to
replace it with a virtuous behavior. In other cases, one has too
limited an awareness that one has failed to behave thoughtfully, and
later realizes his or mistake once circumstances have brought it to
his or her attention.

Now, suppose one wishes to change behavior; realizing what the problem
is is only the first step. To change this behavior one must realize
there is a problem _as it is happening_ and then act differently than
one has done in the past.

This is much easier said than done.

If you review the "workout," such as it is, you'll see that most of it
is composed of _directed reflection_. Additionally, it is not all at
once. It is several short periods during the day - periods
specifically set aside for just such reflection. This makes even more
sense when you look at the purpose of prayer and meditation within the
context of the Baha'i Faith, from which it is drawn:

* prayer as seen as being in the presence of the Godhead
* meditation seen as looking within oneself to gain knowledge of the
true self

In this context, it seems the purpose of all these activities is to _reflect
more properly on our actions_. Self-awareness turns out to be very
important, then.

The root problem, when we wish to improve ourselves, is that most of
our action is automatic, habitual or instinctual. Charles Duhigg's
book  _The Power of Habit_
tells an amusing-sounding but serious case study of an older patient
who has suffered massive brain damage to his memory - enough to make
deliberation and learning practically impossible. One would think such
a person would become an invalid based on the damage suffered.
Yet that was not the case - he was
able to carry out a full variety of activities, and continued in his
daily routine. When interrupted, he could get incredibly disoriented -
because he had no awareness of the actions he was carrying out! Yet if
allowed to proceed uninterrupted, he would continue with his daily
routine. All through the force of habitual, unconscious actions.

This is why willpower alone is doomed to fail. Like our wandering
senior above, we carry out a huge number of tasks with a complete lack
of conscious thought. We know this from cognitive research - brain
activity is seen even before we are aware of making a decision. By the
time we make a decision, it is already made. And when asked about
these decisions, we may give plausible-sounding answers - but it is
simply our brain coming up with after-the-fact justifications for our
actions. In reality, our brain decided without us even knowing why.

What we need is a way of breaking the cycle of habit. And this is what
these all aim to do - give space for us to break habitual action and
bring awareness to our actions. Let's take meditation, which has been
studied. It has been shown to ease anxiety and lessen
triggers for the stress response. Since the stress response tends to
induce a lot of habitual, reflexive action - it the source of the
stress-responding "System A," the "fast thinking" in Daniel Kahneman's
_Thinking Fast and Slow_ - then lessening the stress response is going
to lessen this engagement on habits, and allow space to act in a
manner in which actual thought is engaged.

What about actions beside meditation? These also try to achieve
much the same effect. They attempt to slow down thought and the
automatic engagement of habitual action, and force self-reflection on
a regular basis. The goal is bring enough self-awareness that we
become aware of our habits, good and bad. While such activities are
insufficient to effect positive changes, they are indeed necessary.

In that manner, we can work to change actions to make negative actions
less habitual. "Trying" to be a better person will not work; if your
actions through the day are automatic, the only "trying" one will do
is beating oneself up after-the-fact after realizing one has fallen
short in one way or another.

Indeed, if you can't do any of the activities mentioned, there is one
thing you can do - nothing! Have you ever done nothing - intentionally
done nothing - and just spaced out? It turns out that when this
happens, your brain isn't doing anything - it's actually going into
"default mode" (yes, your brain was discovered to have a default
mode). It turns out that in thinking of nothing, [your brain carries
out a wide varieties of
activities](https://www.themeditationblog.com/the-brains-default-mode-network-what-does-it-mean-to-us/). It
turns out that allowing your brain to wander in default mode has the
same effect as an active "mindfulness" workout. If you're looking for
a reason to stop looking at your smartphone when you're in line at the
store counter, this is it. And moreover, if simply _doing nothing_ is
beneficial, how much moreso it may be to introduce activities to
guarantee this sort of thought into your schedule.

-------------------------------------

So if you want to "be a better person," how should this work? How do
you place these activites as a core of any effort to improve yourself?
It depends upon what you want:

* If you know what things you really need to work on - then this is
  pretty obvious. These are the actions you should meditate about.

* If you really don't know what to work on, but you just want to be
  "better," than you should particularly meditate on reviewing your
  own actions throughout the day. The end-of-day review could be
  particularly helpful.

If you practice the Baha'i Faith, it is taken on faith that these
activities will assist you, but if not - and even if you're not
religious - then at least in theory, it should assist in bringing
awareness to your problem and eliminating its habitual nature.

So that's the pitch. I can't promise you the virtues path I've
outlined is ideal, but it works for me, and I believe it's the right
place to start.

### ADDENDUM: A Caveat Regarding Social Pressure

This may be off-topic, but I do have something of an appendix to the
above. This is something I've learned over the years, having to do
with determining what you need to improve.

Supposing you are trying to better yourself, based on feedback you've
got from one person, or perhaps a handful of people, and it falls in
this category:

* You've been led to believe you're flawed in certain ways based on
  feedback from one person or people in a small social circle. You're
  struggling to understand why it is bad.

Acting on self-improvement based on this sort of feedback can be
particularly challenging. My experience is that it can even be dangerous.

It is possible that you really do have flaws, and you don't realize
them. Indeed, sometimes, it might only be someone very close to you
that will say something, if it is about a particularly
sensitive issue. But what do you do if you don't understand why it's
wrong, or if their feedback asks you to correct behaviors you even
think are good behaviors?

Perhaps you're thinking this is because you're so flawed, you don't
even realize what's wrong with you. Perhaps you're thinking you're
even slightly sociopathic.

Well, sociopathy is easy to rule out. The signs are obvious -
inability to control anger, frequent lying. And a lot of negative
feedback, not just from this person, but from lots of other
people. Indeed this sort of negative feedback by society is one reason
most sociopaths eventually straighten up in society.

Still if you're getting negative feedback, and you have no idea where
it's coming from, it may be valid, even though
you don't see any problems. My point isn't that you're a psychopath -
but rather, such feedback may be extremely helpful to you. It's
possible you should listen to others. This is especially the case if
this is feedback from someone whose character you know to be good.

However, if the signs don't sync up, and if it's just one person, or a
small group of people and you wonder if they have your best interest
at heart, then you have a decision to make.

If someone believes you're flawed, it may be for reasons
havoing far more to do with themselves than yourself.
If you have to deal with someone who is truly toxic,
they may be able to make you feel guilty about anything that doesn't
serve their narrow interest. Peers may do the same if you fail to
conform to their own unwritten norms, norms that have nothing to do
with morality, or may even be against it.

Unfortunately, there is no sign on someone's forehead telling you
they're toxic. Indeed, the worst people are frequently those that can
use emotional manipulation to make you do what they want. They may be
using negative feedback about your character not because they believe
it to be true, but are trying to manipulate your behavior for their ends.

How to know? Again, self-reflection is a key guide. When
self-reflecting, you may need to tune out the voices of others in your
social circle. If you believe you are being criticized for vices,
that's one thing, and this is a valuable signal. But if you are
instead being criticized for virtues, that is something far more
sinister. Worst case, you may find that you have a different problem -
not a need for self improvement, but a need to halt destructive
criticism from someone else. You may find that to gain proper
perspective, you may need to distance oneself from a toxic person or
peer group.

This is one reason why your choice of friends are so important for
your development:

    He should treasure the companionship of them that have renounced
    the world, and regard avoidance of boastful and worldly people a
    precious benefit.

	(Baha'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 265)

Make sure the people you surround yourself with will
support your growth as a person. In your struggle for self-awareness,
surround yourself with people balanced enough to who see you as you
actually are. The worst people are always going to try to drag you
down to their own level.
