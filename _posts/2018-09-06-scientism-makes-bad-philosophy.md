# Scientism Makes Bad Philosophy

I ran into this whopper of an article on the usually-excellent
[Aeon](aeon.co) website:
[Why It's Only Science That Can Answer All the Big
Questions](https://aeon.co/ideas/why-its-only-science-that-can-answer-all-the-big-questions)

This seems to be amateur philosophy, so I'll do my own amateur
philosophy and post a definition from wikipedia:

    **Scientism** is the ideology of science. The term **scientism**
    generally points to the cosmetic application of science in
    unwarranted situations not amenable to application of the
    scientific method or similar scientific standards.

Usually articles which fall prey to scientism go to great
lengths to hide this weakness. This one is so blatent about it,
it's embedded right there in the title.

When I read the article, I had one of those little moments of self-doubt that I
usually have when I see something like this; e.g. "Is this article as
really bad as I think it is? What am I missing?" Turns out I wasn't
alone; it appeared in the 'badphilosophy' reddit forum, so I wasn't
the only one.

The typical positivist canard is
that questions that can't be answered be recourse to emperical testing
are untestable and therefore meaningless. Since philosophy has moved
beyond that assertion, the writer instead makes an even stronger
claim:

    One class consists of invented questions that are often based on
    unwarranted extrapolations of human experience. They typically
    include questions of purpose and worries about the annihilation of
    the self, such as *Why are we here?* and *What are the attributes
    of the soul?* They are not real questions, because they are not
    based on evidence.

This is classic. Ya hear that? All those questions you had about
purpose of life and normative ethics and how to lead a good life and
all that?  You can just ignore those because *they aren't "real"
questions.*

"I cannot answer this question; ergo, it is unimportant."

Blah. Along the lines of something someone said on the badphilosophy
reddit formula, it appears that actual concerns that dominate the
thoughts of day-to-day activity - "should I do this?" and "what is the
right thing to do" and "what purpose have I for doing this" - somehow
are fare more predominant than these Big Questions like "what is dark
matter really made of" and "where is that lepton going to go under
this magnetic field." Saying science can answer all the questions
provided they get to pick which ones is little better than my 11-year
old son saying he can answer all the questions on his Spanish test
provided he gets to pick which ones.
