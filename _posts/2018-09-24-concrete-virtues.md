# Getting Real about the Virtues
Self-improvement, as a whole, is a laudable goal. It is also a popular
one; bookstores have entire sections called self-help which consist of
books on self-improvement. Go on YouTube and you will find plenty of
videos on the subject; many websites, both nonreligious and religious
are dedicated to writings helping their readers improve their
lives.

There are many types of self-improvement, but one of the most common
themes are those of _character development_ or _virtue
improvement_. Many of these resources are religious in nature, but
equally important are those that are entirely nonreligious, as well as
some that are vaguely religious, yet so nonsectarian as to be
unidentifiable from any distinct religious tradition; for example,
Alcoholics Anonymous and the various "X Anonymous" movements. Indeed,
in spite of the fact that virtue and character development doesn't
immediately make you any money or win you immediate love, it is
surprising that these sorts of self-improvement resources are some of
the most popular around.

This serious of blog post is one tiny drop in the ocean of
self-improvement books. And the prior posts have offered a general
path to self-improvement based on guided self-reflection and
mindfulness, in a spiritual yet non-sectarian manner.

When one wishes to get specific about character improvement, usually
one has specific character in mind. If you want to become a "better
person," usually you have something specific in mind. Perhaps you want
to be better at relating to others. Or be more disciplined with your
use of time. Perhaps you wish to be less materialistic or
indulgent. Or more persistent, or courageous in the face of
stressors. Working on any of these will strengthen your character -
yet at the same time, they are all different things!

The point is, with self-reflection, you will find more specific things
you want to improve. You will need to identify those things, and put
in place a plan of action. But to identify those things, you must
first understand what those things are. And I, as the blog post
author, must be able to identify the sorts of things people may wish
to work on.

This leads to classification of the virtues.

-----

There are a number of ways of classifying virtues. Aristotle had his
own classification; medieval philsophers had their own. Many popular
self-help books propose their own. _The Virtues Project_ is a resource
for childhood character education that proposes 52 such
virtues. Indeed, it would be great if someone attempted to harmonize
these lists.

Fortunately, this was done. There is one rigorous study that aimed to
definitively classify these in a scientific manner, for just this sort
of treatment. It is also of a fairly recent vintage:

_Character Strengths and Virtues_, Christopher Peterson and Martin E. P. Seligman. Oxford University Press, 2004.

It is a broad, dense, comprehensive book of virtues, and an incredible
sourcebook for those who want to work seriously in this field. It
seems perhaps more aimed at psychologists and social workers who want
a reference to assist with research in this area. And fortunately, I
find it useful enough to help narrow down virtues into easily
classifiable, intuitive categories. Which is why I'm using their
classification, in spite of my familiarity with _The Virtues
Project_.

_Character Strengths and Virtues_ classifies virtues into six distinct, easily
recognizeable character strengths:

1. Wisdom and Knowledge (cognitive strengths)
2. Courage (emotional strength)
3. Humanity (interpersonal strength)
4. Justice (civic strengths)
5. Temperance (self control)
6. Transcendence (finding meaning)

By classifying these sorts of virtues, it is easy to talk about types
of virtues. This makes this classification more useful than really
exhaustive lists, as some virtues are so related as to be almost
inseparable (honesty and trustworthiness, for example). On the other
hand, these categories are so distinct as to see how one could have
significant strenghts in one category but deficiets in another. You
yourself may be able to relate.  For instance, we may know someone
with a very quick temper (#5 above, poor self-control) who is also
very wise (#1), or someone who fights for justice and lets it guide
his actions (#4) while being failing to commit to it during periods of
stress or pressure (or lacking courage, #2).

This is important because improving behavior in any one of these
categories may involve the use of certain tools that may apply better
to one category of virtue development but not others. For instance,
psychotherapy can certainly help with one's humanity (interpersonal
skills) and emotional strength (courage), but is less likely to help
with one's sense of justice. A solitary spiritual retreat in nature is
likely to help with one's sense of wonder and balance (transcendence)
while being unable to assist one in their dealings with others once
they come back (humanity).

Making this more concrete, this guidebook classifies specific
classical virtues in this manner:

WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE
* creativity (both originality and ingenuity)
* curiosity
* open-mindedness (includes critical thinking)
* love of learning (incluedes mastering skills, may include excellence?)
* perspective (wisdom)

COURAGE
* Bravery/Valor (e.g. what we usually think of as courage)
* Persistence (also, industriousness)
* Integrity (includes honesty)
* Vitality (zest, enthusiasm, vigor)

HUMANITY
* Love
* Kindness (includs generosity, nuruing, care, compassion)
* "Social intelligence" (awareness of other people, tact, courtesy)

JUSTICE
* Citizenship (includes loyalty, teamwork)
* Fairness (treating everyone the same)
* "Leadership" (includes encouragement, unity to some extent)

TEMPERANCE
* Forgiveness, mercy
* Humility, modesty
* Prudence
* Self-regulation (include discipline, control of appetites)

TRANSCENDENCE
* Appreciation of beauty, excellence (includes awe, reverence)
* Gratitude (thankfulness)
* Hope (optimism, "future-orientation")
* Humor (playfulness, joy)
* Spirituality (faith, purposefulness, "meaning of life")

As shown above, there are 6 broad categories and 24 more specific
categories. This does not precisely line up with the virtues
project curriculum I referenced earlier, but the differences seem very
reasonable given the fact that the virtues curriculum is focused on
juveniles. Indeed, the only virtue I can think of that is missing is
"cleanliness" and other sorts of 'virtues of basic hygiene.' While
admittedly important, this is something youth and adults rarely find
necessary to work on themselves, and generally can be thought of as a
form of self-regulation.

The handbook's writers theorize the common appearance of these "big
six" virtues is due to it's evolutionary nature. If that is the case,
then it is doubtless true that they will continue to be valuable.

## Where Does This Take Us?

If one wants to generally "be a better person," than the general
efforts toward self improvement outlined in the prior posts may be
sufficient. However, I suspect that most people have particular areas
of concern.

By defining what these areas of virtues are, it allows us to target
certain areas of behavior. If indeed virtue is manifested as a set of
moral habits, the way to improve oneself is to adopt new habits. One
needs to adopt habits in those areas one wishes to improve, but
without identifying those areas, figuring which habits to adopt is a
lost cause.

Let's repeat these six areas again:

1. Wisdom and Knowledge (cognitive strengths)
2. Courage (emotional strength)
3. Humanity (interpersonal strength)
4. Justice (civic strengths)
5. Temperance (self control)
6. Transcendence (finding meaning)

If you review them yourself, you will probably see that you are strong
in some and lousy at others. Not to confess inappropriately, but I
tend to see myself as very strong in temperance, wisdom and perhaps
justice, not so strong in transcendence, and weak in humanity and
courage. I don't need a quiz to tell me that; as an adult of
some mumblemumblemumble years of experience, I know where my strengths
and problems are. If you don't know, then perhaps the virtuous path of
self-reflection is where you should start with.

My challenges are going to require different tools than someone who is
always friendly with people and always knows the same thing yet seems
blind to issues of justice and reciprocity. While both I and another
person would benefit from the virtues workout outlined in prior posts,
specific actions we can take are going to be quite different, as we
have different challenges.

Peterson and Seligman, the authors of the survey, are clear that some
people have a natural inclination toward some virtues. Indeed, the
"big five" personality traits reflect inborn strengths in some of
these virtues - extroverts stronger in humanity, those open to new
experience stronger in certain aspects of wisdom, the more
conscienscious stronger with temperance, neurotics lower in courage,
and so forth. This can make for a disturbing realization - that
perhaps virtues is unevenly distributed by birthright, just as money,
physical characteristics and intelligence is. It seems unfair to
realize that part of your virtue strengths may be due to genetic luck
of the draw. Also, if you are a fan of Aristotle's notion of virtue as
a balance between two extremes, you may find this formulation
challenging, since a strength is viewed as a good, not a balance. In
other words, you may not be starting with zero.

However, this realization doesn't change your actions, nor your
responsiblity to better yourself. Whether through birthright,
training, or luck, you will be strong in some areas and weak in other
areas and it is best to realize that. While it important to work
_with_ your strengths (for instance, if you're bookish, don't ignore
that!), you will be limited by your weaknesses if you don't work on
them. A real will to become a better person means working on those
areas that are the most difficult, and recognizing that they can be
improved.

In fact I daresay our broken political dialog in the democracies is
due to the fact that certain political views elevate some virtues and
attempt to dispense with others (I suspect those virtues they find
personally challenging). Elevate courage and temperence and totally
dispense with justice and wisdom and you get "AM radio conservatives"
who think things can be fixed by wishing away large segments of society.
Elevate justice and wisdom and dispense with temperance and humanity
and you get ineffective "grad-school liberals" whose hopes to change
the world are thwarted by neverending arguments with each other over
imagined slights. It is obvious these two groups of people have little
to share with one another, as they see nothing of value with each
other. Putting together such people in a room to hash out differences
will solve nothing; your best bet is to ensure such people don't get
in the room to begin with.

Fortunately, you don't have to fix our political system, nor can
you. You just have to fix yourself.

### An Appendix: Virtues in the Baha'i Writings

As an aside, one may wonder how this fits in with Baha'i viewpoints of
virtues. Having done a study, I can generally say - very well. For the
most part, all are covered by explicit writings translated into
English, and are not particularly difficult to find. Some are perhaps
less emphasized, and there are a few that are unusual. For instance,
there are explicit writings on cleanliness, which as indicated, is
important but does not make it in other explicit lists. I also didn't
find many writings explicitly addressing valor and bravery, but the
frequent invocation of the martyers in the writings would seem to
argue for its importance as a virtue.

I have a few thoughts on some of the other less central virtues which
nonetheless have a distinct emphasis in central writings such as _The
Hidden Words_:

* Association with those of good character

While not seen as a virtue, there is little argument that the company
you keep is important for your character. While it may be hard to see
how hanging out with those of better character will magically rub off
on you, it's certainly the case that hanging out with those of less
virtue will make you less disciplined and less inclined toward the
sacrifices required of virtuous behavior.

* Chastity

This is related to both modesty and prudence. Even those who defend
all sorts of sexual freedoms generally have limits of things they
would not do; it is just, then, a matter of degree. The Baha'i Faith
recognizes, as does many religions, the fact that overindulgent
behavior in this area does not lead to happiness, but may lead to bad
habits which will make one unhappy.

* Contentment, Happiness

Contentment is similar to happiness but not the same; while happiness
is normally thought of as an emotion, contentment is a virtue that
leads to both gratitude and happiness. As such, happiness is sometimes
spoken of a virtue in much the same way; that is, an action and
attitude that will lead to happy emotions. These are transcental
virtues.

* Detachment

This is a virtue of wisdom and knowledge and is repeatedly referenced
in the writings. In the above list of virtues, it is most similar to
"perspective."

* Avoidance of disputation, peacefulness

These are virtues of humanity. The Baha'i Faith makes a distinction
between disagreements and polite arguments on one hand, and rancor and
conflict on the other hand. The latter is recognized as being a verbal
violence just as damaging as the physical kind.

* Duty

Associated with concepts like Dharma in other religions, when used in
the Baha'i Faith it is more associated with virtues like loyalty and
respect for bonds of family. As such, it is another virtue of
humanity.

* Fear of God

Classically, this is generally associated with awe and reverence as a
transcendent virtue. However, certain Baha'i writings do talk of fear
of God in the ordinary sense of the word; that is, dread of
punishment. In the Baha'i Faith, this is generally accepted as a
metaphor for a spritual concept, but is also used to indicate there is
a justice on a spiritual level. Books like _God Passes By_ describe
God's judgement as if it were something very much like karma.

* Friendship, Unity

More virtues of humanity, possibly emphasized due to the social nature
of the teachings.

* Idealism

Another aspect of justice which is also related to faithfulness, it
presumes that there are particular ideals that are good and worth
defending, even to the pain of one's own death. Its lack in modern
society is more notable by the presence of its total absence, which is
the corrosive cynicism of "LOL Nothing Matters."

* Logic

A wisdom virtue that is not typically identified as a virtue but
perhaps should be. It is importance of using sound thinking when
analyzing problems, in spite of emotional attachments. While related
to detachment, this is more in line with the need to recognize
cognitive flaws and biases.

* Obedience

This is a virtue in many cultures but is not univeral; it is easily
misused by many "honor societies" in the service of enforcement of
inegalitarian societies, and frequently abets iniquity. In the Baha'i
Faith, however, rightful obidience is essentially used in a few
different contexts totally distinct from this. The more important
context is obedience to God's commandments, generally related to
self-regulation and self control, virtues of temperance. There is also
obedience Baha'i institutions, which is generally more related to
appeals to loyalty, unity and other virtues of humanity. Ergo, in this
situation, one obeys out of recognition of respect for the institution
and perhaps the individual efforts of of those who work of the
institution.
