## Who Killed American Community Life (or: The Fontaine Ferry Misdirection)
There has been much commentary about the slow death of community life
in the United States - about as long as I can remember. I was
recalling this upon seeing a book advertised [... ] The thesis of the
book was that too much energy in society was placed into both the
market and government and not enough in community.

"Community" is a very squishy term. In many cases, it is just used in
a hand-wavey "feeling of belonging" way. This is not at all what it
means. Community exists in a network of friends and voluntary
organizations. If you want to study why "community" is so weak, you
have to study why _those_ have gotten so weak, instead of just
wringing your hands and whining about how bad things are.

This is not a new topic, and indeed, the situation documented is
actually real. Civic organizations are much weaker than they were as
recently as the seventies. This was documented by _Bowling Alone_
decades ago, and I see no sign that things are any better now than
they were back then. Even informal friendships are a probem; I hear
the median number of friends a married man in his fifties has, outside
of his wife, is actually zero. ZERO.

I was reminded of this when I tried to get my daughter in Girl
Scouts. When I was a kid, getting your kid into Girl Scouts or Boy
Scouts was a bit like falling off a rock; if you wanted into a tribe,
you were in. It wasn't as if you had to look for it; there was one
associated with your public school, one associated your church,
various civic organizations, and so on. However, my daughter is not in
Girl Scouts. Why? Because there is no active troop that covers her!
Not in 2018. The problem, essentially, is that Girl Scouts has always
relied upon intense involvement by parent volunteers (almost always
the moms), who must voluntarily come together as a group, get trained,
organize and run the group for a few years. Far from being stable,
freestanding organizations like Boy Scout troops (many of which have
operated for decades under the same sponsorships), these are far more
dynamic. And many paretns around here simply don't have the time for
this sort of time-intensive community involvement.

If you look around the horizon, there are plenty of other
examples. When's the last time you ever heard of someone going to a
Moose Lodge or a Shriner's Hall? A Rotarian meeting? Or running a
volunteer organization? For most of us, this is something our parents
or grandparents did, not us. Even organizations that at one time were
professional and social in nature are now organizations that do little
but publish magazines and send out newletters, with meetings that are
sparsely attended and unappealing in nature.

Robert Putnam's _Bowling Alone_ was years ago and is an excellent
analysis of this problem; my only irritation is that he not do as good
a job on putting his finger on the cause of this collapse. Perhaps
this was because he was studing this when this trend was only starting
to become apparent. However, at this point, the root cause should be
obvious - a lack of *quality* time available for discretionary
activities. Period.

Consider:

* The rise of two-career families;
* The intensive nature of parenting;
* The extensive work committments needed by knowldge worker careers;
* The growth of exurbs and the hour-long communtes that go with them.

These are such major changes from domestic life in the early twentieth
century that I cannot see how there can be any other such
explanation. The problem, essentially, is that paid work and the work
of parenting is now such a necessity in American life that all other
concerns - even down to forming friendships with neighbors - are
pushed to the side as time-consuming frivolities. The necessity of
this fact was identified as early as the nineties by a then-little
known professor named Elizabeth Warren.  Objectors to this theory have
noted that many Americans spend a lot of time on the TV and computers,
but the time spent on those activities is not equivalent,
quality-wise: that discretionary time is actually spent slumped on the
couch in exhaustion late in the evening, when the only reasonable
alternative it to go to bed. One does not engage in civic
organizations at 10:30PM at night. And as Facebook has proved beyond a
doubt, internet activity is not a solution.

Now, were this problem stated in this straightforward a fashion, and
the tradeoffs made clear, this would be a solvable problem. Either
community life is worth spending time on, or it isn't. And the
millenials seem to be making a conscious effort to adjust these
tradeoff. At least around here, there seems to be much more demand
than there used to be for houses close to work; many young parents are
actively backing off the "helicopter parent" mindset that robs them of
their time and robs their children of developmental opportunities;
many seem much less prone to punch in an 11-hour day just to get a
little ahead.

Of course, there are plenty of people who don't want this
tradeoff. Thus we have attempts to pin the blame on the usual
scapegoats. Which leads me to what I call "The Fontaine Ferry
Misdirection."

-----------------------

A lot of thoughtful-sounding people (usually, but not always, of the
center-right persuasion) are careful to point out *diversity* as a
problem in our culture. Indeed, they will frequently raise this to
explain Why We Can't Have Nice Things.

Good government? "Well it works in Scandanavia, but that's such a
homogenous country. They don't have our *diversity*." Good education
system? "It's hard to construct good public schools with such a
*diverse* student body." Acceptable civic norms? Patriotic service
initiatives? "It may work in other countries, but we have such a
*diverse* citizenship."

What does this *diversity* mean to these speakers? Is there something
magical about having a 25 percent nonwhite population that makes these
things suddenly difficult? Would it be magically easier if everyone in
society was a white dude with a college education in their fifties?

Which leads me to The Fontaine Ferry Park misdirection.
The Fontaine Ferry misdirection happens when you have someone who 
wants to complain about X in society, and you want everyone to know
the problem is X without sounding like a jerk. Here's the back story:

When my parents were growing up, there was an amusement park in
Louisville called Fontaine Ferry. By the time I was old enough to ask
(the early seventies), it was closed down. My would tell me it was no
big loss, as it had seen better days. This isn't a distinctive story -
midcentry, every city in American had modest little amusement parks,
but in the sixties and seventies, a huge number of them closed down,
as they were unable to compete with newer, bigger amusement parks and
driving patterns. It was fundamentally the same dynamic that caused
all the resorts in the Catskills to shut down around the same time.

Here's the thing: up until 1964, Fontaine Ferry was whites-only. Yes,
that's right: NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR. So you know where this is
heading. After years of dragging their feet, the owners finally
relented - and at the same time, stopped updating their park (just
like many others around the country), and eventually the park died a
deserving death.

So you know where this was going: when I was growing up, I heard
my share of people say "Fontaine Ferry was great! Everything was just
great, until they let in *those people*. And then everything went to
hell. That's what happens if you let *those people* ruin
everything."

I'll let you figure out exactly what word they used instead of *those
people*.

So whenever people complain that the reason we don't have strong civic
organizations or a sense of community is *diversity*, the same reason
given why we can't have good government or decent transit, I think of
the people I knew when I was a kid who blamed everything, absolutely
everything, right down to the closure of an amusement park that
couldn't make it, on *those people*.

It will be hard to figure out why community life has withered - just
as it's hard to figure out many other problems in society. But it does
have solutions. Someone who says the problem is *diversity* is trying
to change the subject, and on top of that, argue about something
nobody wants to argue with them about. We'll never figure out problems if we
engage with them on that level.
