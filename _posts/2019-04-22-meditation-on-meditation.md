# A Meditation on Meditation

or

### Really, It Isn't That Hard

I've discussed in earlier blog post a sort of "foundational" exercise
for virtues based on prayer, meditation and reflection. After some
difficulties early last year, I've finally settled into this habit,
consistently spending around 30 minutes each night on this.

Of these three things, one seems to have gotten very trendy and
of-the-moment: meditation. When I go to the library nowadays, I see a
lot of books on how to meditation. While I'm happy to see so many
people embracing this habit, there's part of me that thinks "Books?
BOOKS? You need to read entire books to figure out how to do this?"
Let's be clear, these are pitched at you are practical how-to
manuals. Actual mechanics.

Some topics are deep enough to bear a lot of discussion and
explanation; that's why your lawyers' office is full of tons of books,
and why software engineers usually have a half-dozen books on their
desk in spite of the fact that they get 99% of their information from
Stack Overflow. But I do not think meditation is something that bears
that much how-to. You just find a comfortable position
and... meditate. Think about the glories of existence, or something
"spiritual," or Yahweh/deity, or if you're an athest, nothing (ha, get
it?) (No, I'm serious, secular techniques have you think of nothing.)
Whatever floats your boat, spiritually.

I know why people sometimes feel the need for more extensive
guidance. Lots of people have difficulty meditating, and I'm sure many
of these books aimed at exactly those people. But I wonder if in their
verboslity, much of the guidance given is counterproductive or
outright wrong.

A few correctives I have to much of the "guidance":

**You should not feel pain during meditation.** I've come across a
writings, sometimes by people who should know better, that state
outright that pain are signals from your lizard brain that you must
fight in your search for enlightenment. Well, no. Perhaps yes if
you've been meditating for 10 minutes as a newbie and you feel occasional
twitching, spasms and discomfort, this "pain" is something you
absolutely should work through.

But most pain you experience, particularly as a new meditation
practitioner, is a signal from your body OK STOP DOING THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO HURT SOMETHING. A twitching that goes away several seconds
later? Ignore that. A lower back pain that last the last 15 minutes of
your meditation and stays with you an hour after the meditation? You
neither want nor need that! You don't work through that - you avoid it.

There are a few culprits:

- If you have bad posture, you'll inevitably get back pain. You have
  to pick a posture that allows you to keep your spine straight. The
  "lotus pose" can help, if done right, but it's no panacea.

- The popular "lotus pose," or other cross-legged positions, can put a
  lot of stress on your knee ligaments, particularly if you are older
  or stiff. Unless you're good enough at yoga to avoid this problem,
  you should avoid this, or at the very least sit on a yoga block so
  you can elevate your hips above your knees.

You need a pose that a) is comfortable and b) allows you to stay in
one position for the durection of the meditation, preferably one
that's not so comfortable you fall asleep (which is why lying down on
your bed is not recommended). That's it.

If you have trouble holding
any position long, one thing I'd recommend is
yoga. This is -not- recommended because it's "spiritual" or anything
like that. It's recommended because your problem is probably lack of
flexibility, and yoga will help with that. It will also help identify
which positions are good and which are bad, in that a good yoga
instructor will focus on proper posture in poses. That will give you
some of the knowledge you need to avoid hurting yourself in meditation
poses. But that's really it.

What do I do? I have several I've used, but I've found that pretty
much any pose in the "sun salutation" can actually be held without
pain or strain for at least several minutes. They actually give me
less trouble than the lotus pose, though some can be more tiring. If
you want to meditate for 30 minutes, you'll need to pick your pose
carefully.

**Suggestions on how to get into a meditative state are just that -
suggestions.** I've a handful of things that indicate what you must
meditate on, but it's far more frequent that you get a lot of
suggestions - so much so that it's hard to know what to focus
on. Ironical, since the purpose of much meditation is to focus on
nothing.

Oddly, this is one thing where I think things are a little out of
whack. When I was Catholic, one thing the nuns hammered on my was
praying The Rosary. That's a way to enter a meditative state. But to
hear the secular acolytes of meditation, this is horrible - because
meditation is so *totally* different then prayer, what with all the
"blaming and shaming" that goes on with it. Well.... no. Sure, if you
were raised by either fundamentalists or, alternately, by agnostics
who had nothing to do with religion, then your exposure to prayer is limited
to the sorts of stereotypes you see in Hollywood movies, who generally
only introduce religious dialog the way one sneaks a murder weapon
onto the stage; i.e., to cause damage to a character later.
But the purpose and effect of prayer are so similar that there
isn't much point of making a distinction. If you want to say a mantra,
fine. If you want to play a game of not thinking about anything,
fine. If you want to repeat a really long prayer in your head,
fine. As long as the end result is the same.

Personally, I usually spend a few minutes with a Baha'i prayer book
before meditation because it helps me get into a meditative state that
much more quickly; otherwise, I'm still thinking about whatever it is
I was using meditation to get away from.

**How long do you meditate for?** I have an answer and... the answer
is, there is no answer. There, isn't that totally zen.

There seems to be a consensus of twenty minutes. For me, that actually
worked; I did all sorts of tweaks to my prayer schedule and meditation
schedule and coordinated with my other oblication and the end result
for me was... twenty minutes.

But really, this is whatever works for you. If I could clear my mind
in fifteen seconds and benefit from it, I would. I know myself to know
that isn't going to work. It's like running; usually people who run
have their own reasons for why they run as long as they do. They don't
ask each other "how long should I be running for."

So when they say "whatever works" and you don't know whatever works -
trial and error. Try ten minutes, then fifteen, etc. For me, ten
minutes was too short, I was unable to maintain thirty minutes in a
row, and I don't have time to do twice a day. Therefore, twenty
minutes once a day it is.
