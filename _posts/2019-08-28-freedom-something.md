# Freedom, as a Tribe
So yesterday at work I'm minding my own business and I get an
interruption. We have a Slack-like chat tool at work, and I'm used to
getting people bothering me out of the blue for one thing or another a
few times every day. Normally they're there to pester me because they
expect I know who can answer their question; I either know the answer
or send them on their way.

But this was different. Someone is inviting me to join the chat group
on FREEDOM.

This was on one of the special-interest, non-work related chat rooms that
work supports - one of those "since you're going to do it anyway,
let's keep it in the open so we can make sure it doesn't get
unprofessional" sort of policies. We have chat groups on yoga,
bicycling, vegetarianism, techno music, cryptocurrency, Russian
language, whatever people are into. And on the internal directory
listing all hundred-odd groups, there it was. The Freedom chat
group. Along with the organizer's mandate.

What did the mandate say it would discuss? Well, they
listed things like civil liberties, cryptocurrency, and "the need to
defend freedom, given the freedoms we've already lost."

Freedoms we've already lost? When did this happen? When we move out
from the caves and started farming? When the appearance of motorized
wheeled vehicles caused cities to draw up jaywalking laws? Well, I
suspect that since this is framed as an issue of concern, that this is
something recent, so they're complaining about freedoms we've lost
recently. What is it?  Could they, you know, give an example?

My initial reaction was that this was someone looking for other right
wingers to plot a takover of HR, [sorta like happened
here](https://www.wired.com/story/the-dirty-war-over-diversity-inside-google/).
But in all likelihood, I'm projecting.  Things are probably simpler
than they first appear. My guess is that the organizers figured you
can't have a Libertarian chat group, much like you have a can't have a
Jewish chat group, or a Republican chat group. It's an HR minefield
and no way they will let you greenlight that. But you can have a
Freedom group. Hence this group. Why do I suspect Libertarian?
Because if you throw cryptocurrency and "freedom" together, you get a
perfect 1:1 correlation with libertarianism.

In any event, I know *none* of these things, but in any event I gave
him thanks for reaching out and took a pass.

The problem I have is I feel you can't make Freedom a "tribe." Freedom
isn't something that unites people. Perhaps love for freedom - which
is what they will claim. But whose freedom, and which ones? To me, if
you just define freedom as "freedom to do whatever you want," I'll
think of the freedom to come into work in gymn shorts, turn on a
stereo playing latter-era John Coltrane and eat kimchi at my desk. I
won't be working, of course, since if I'm celebrating my total
freedom. I'll be playing card games with my seven-year old
daughter. That, my friends, is freedom. Of course, this is a very
particular sort of freedom, one that would have precisely one chat
group participant. Don't look for me in the chat group, I won't be
there. I'll be playing cards.
