# Some Advice When You're Over Forty, and Need to Hit the Gym.

Over the past few years, I've learned something the hard way. I have
an achey body to show for it.

When you get older (say, over forty-five?) you have to change your
workout style to: more-frequent, less long. That may mean the end of
your "bulk up" routine.

Yours truly has gone to the gym, off and on, for the past
thirty-some-odd years. The reason I started going was shallow and
obvious - I was ridiculously thin and underbuilt, and I wasn't going
to get any attention from the opposite sex until I did something about
that. In my thirties I realized I was _never_ going to get bulk, but I
was good enough so I kept at it for health reasons. But when I did it,
it was always the same - three times a week (when I could do it),
usually for a little over an hour, with emphasis on strength training
and whatever made me look good.

Having kids threw that off, and I was never able to get back into it
consistently. And I've noticed over the years why I've had trouble
staying with it. I used to feel great after a visit to the gym, and
I'd sleep better too. Those easy rewards helped me stay
consistent. But after my mid-forties, the opposite became the case. I
never felt better afterwards, just tired and ready for bed. Even
without pushing myself, I'd have muscle aches and twinges for
days. And my reward for my lower body workout was aches in my knees and
hips. The harder I worked out at the gym, the worse my sleep was at
night.

The problem was simple - I was using the same sorts of workout
schedule as I had used all my life, and it was no longer good for
me.

*Per physician's request, I've changed it to a thirty-to-forty minute
workout five to six times a week.*

This is something I'd heard I should do for years, but
ignored, because I didn't think it gave me what I wanted. Working out
that frequently meant no more trips to the gym; I'd have to do it at
home. I could do strength training but it would be shorter than I was
used to. The main emphasis would have to stay on cardio, and that
meant less muscle-building exercise. I didn't want to change.

But my body was telling me in every way possible that it wasn't
working for me. Not only was I feeling lousy after gym visits, but I
had no more muscle than I did when I laid off going to the gym. I was
beating myself up for no effect.

So I've stopped. I'm doing five times a week at home for just a few
weeks, and I'm already feeling much better. And I'm actually feeling
*better* and more energetic after my workouts again. If I had any idea
what a big difference this would make, I'd have shifted to this years ago.

Addendum: if you're over forty, be *very careful* about HIIT (high
intensity interval training). Especially with the kettlebells. You can
get a very good workout at home with HIIT, but the problem is that
many of the favored exercise are high-impact. As you get, um, less
young, your joints are going to complain very quickly about those
exercises. Unfortunately, for a proper HIIT workout, that's going to
limit your options, since it doesn't work unless you can ramp up your
heart rate *very quickly*. Unless you're in truly lousy shape, that
usually means high impact exercise. So put your "7-minute
workout" on the shelf for a while.
