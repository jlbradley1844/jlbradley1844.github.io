# Not a Christian, but a "Red-Letter" Believer

"Hey... it's dark in here. Why is it so dark?"

"_The light is fine, what are you talking about?_"

"Stop kidding, things were fine a few days ago. What. Did. You. Do."

"_Just some redecoration. Something that speaks to me._"

"None of these other lights come on anymore. Did someone fiddle with the electrical system?"

"_I took the bulbs out. They weren't any good anyway. I don't use them, you shouldn't either._"

"No, seriously I need to get stuff done. Knock it off. There's only this one lamp working in the corner and it's got weird stained-glass container over it..."

"_Isn't it beautiful? I love the mystery!_"

"Well I'm taking it off, and I'm fixing these other lights. I can't get anything done." 
(*sound of scuffling*)

"FINALLY. I can see. OMG what is that thing?!?"

"_Turn it off, turn it off!! YOu don't need to see over there..._"

This is, quite obviously, a discussion between a narrator and the world's worst 
roommate. But it's also a tale told by Abdu'l Baha about religion. I can't find 
the source, so I'll just paraphrase:

When the great founders of religion come, they bring a great light into the world. People
are able to "see" spiritually and receive true guidance from the great founders. But over
time, the followers themselves, in an attempt to beautify the light, hide and obscure it.
Over the eons, the light becomes so hidden by man-made additions of one sort or
other. Religion itself is then unable to give guidance. (Inexcusibly, such people frequently
compound their error by claiming that no other light can show truth.)

Another way of putting it - religion ceases to become about the teachings, and instead
becomes nothing but teachings about a religion. All heat, no light.

One thing that sent me on my spiritual journey was the fact that too often, Christianity
was not so much a religion of Jesus, as it was a religion *about* Jesus - or more
specifically, Christ the King. I was raised a Catholic, and I would hazard to say
that only a small part of what we learned in religion was about his teachings and
how to carry them out. Instead, we learned all sorts of other stuff, mostly about Jesus
as Christ and lots of details that are Christian-as-historical-accident. Odd theological
beliefs like:

* Nobody got into heaven until Jesus died. He went up and opened the gates of heaven
and then returned on the Sunday. That explains what he did on Saturday.

* His mother not only conceived a virgin, she never had sex period. This was because
she was so pure, and she ascended to heaven rather than dying and being buried.

* Jesus Christ died to take away our "original sin." He washed all that stuff away when he
died, and that is why he died. Oh, you got "original sin" from Adam. We are all a sinner and
it's his fault.

and so on and so forth. Don't get me started about The Revelation of John.

One day in 1992, more out of curiousity than anything else, I decided to take matters into my
own hands. I had long ago figured out that most of what I learned about Christianity
was not in the Bible - indeed, not even discussed among early believers - but was instead
hammered out in a fallible process by fallible people. In response, I decided to study
just the following: the "red letters" in The Bible.

If you are not a devout Christian - or even if you are - you may not know what a "Red Letter"
bible is. My parents had one. It is ofthen an untouched gift bible - sitting in a cabinet like the
wedding china that hardly gets used. These are expensive bibles with everything said by Jesus
Christ in red letters, as these are seen as particularly special. 

In fact, they are special,
but not for the reasons you might think of. The four gospels were all written well after Jesus'
passing - John in particular was written over two generations later. As far as many of
the stories, religious historians have plenty of
reason to doubt man of the historical accounts here; for instance,  most accounts of Jesus'
birth give extranous details of ahistorical events that violate all reliable histories of
the time. On the other hand, Jesus' sayings are likely to be more reliable.
We have of other confirmatory secondary sources for the books of Mark, Matthew and Luke
about his sayings, and it is felt early believers would have been particulary
careful to accurately relate what Jesus said during retellings. The one possible exception
is the gospel of John, which was written much later and
contains many passage that do not appear in any other source at all.

So I read the red letters only, using this rule:

    Mark, Matthew, Luke and sometimes John

As far as the rest of the New Testament, the earliest letters are all written by Paul,
an early convert who is probably the most responsible for his account to posterity as
Jesus as a redemption figure, recast as Christ the King. His teachings, influential as they
were, are frequently not so much about Jesus' teachings themselves, as they are about
Jesus themselves. So I put those aside.

As a side note, regarding the letters from Paul, biblical historians are in agreement that
probably on seven books were really written by
him. These books are the only ones that consistely show his style (Paul was not a native Greek speaker
and his writing is self-admittedly crude). These seven are still worthwhile. Meanwhile,
some of the others, such as the letters to Timothy, are widely regarded as written
decades later by others in the church and may be considerably less authoritative. 
For instance, here's this famous whopper from the
second chapter of Timothy I:

    Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman 
    to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For 
    Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman 
    being deceived was in the transgression.

Many historians or defenders try to interpret this contextually to mean something
other than its plaintext meaning, but the most obvious 
explanation is probably
the correct one: this passage looks like it doesn't belong in the 
Bible because _it probably
doesn't belong in the bible_. It was probably just some early biship repeating whatever he heard
growing up, and someone who liked it stuck Paul's name on it to make it
appear more important than it really was.)

I recommend that you, too, start a study in which you read only the red letters in Mark,
Matthew and Luke. I'm directing this advice to three types of people:

* If you're a nonbeliever, you'll probably be struck both by how commonsense and insightful
that Jesus' teachings are. Particularly if you are drawn toward another spiritual path,
Jesus' teachings are a good reminder that there's more to spirituality than "centeredness"
or "mindfulness." Spiritual health means going beyond simply not-being-a-jerk.

* If you're a christian, you'll probably see a very wide gap between Jesus' teaching
and whatever your priest or preacher talks about week after week. Before you do this, you
should figure out if your loyalty is to Jesus, or to your church; it will probably
strengthen your faith in one at the cost of greatly weakening your faith in the other.

* And if you're a Baha'i, or a believer of some other sort, it will give you a chance
to experience Jesus' teachings as the actually are, rather than through thirdhand accounts
that tell you all about "the magic of Jesus" without telling you a thing about how Jesus
thought you should be living your life. Baha'is in particular will find very strong
parallels with his teachings to themes Abdu'l-Baha repeatedly covered in
his talks. There's a reason for this: all of the central Baha'i figures were just 
as conversant in the Bible than
they were in the Koran; even The Bab, who had no problem teaching straight out of the
Bible around mullahs, in an age when the Bible was commonly handled with tongs so believers
could keep their distance,

I thought of putting in such a compendium - but why? That would be no favor to you. Just go
ahead and download the King James' bible onto your phone, and start your study. If you want
to use a reader program, you can even highlight what he said as you read, so that you'll
have your own marked-up text for later study. Good luck!
