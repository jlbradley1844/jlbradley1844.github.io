# When Networking Becomes Notworking

Normally when I finish a post it takes me a while to clean up.
This particular post, instead, sat for two year because I wrote it,
then thought to myself "this is too negative, this is more a reflection
of my current state of mind than reality." But having reread this,
I still think this is a valid piece of advice. If it seems artificially
buzzy or intentionally controversial, this is not my intention.
But here's my thesis, which is probably held by some software
developers but by no means all of them. It is:

    If you work in software development, the benefit of "networking"
    activities are greatly, greatly exaggerated.

I've worked in "the software industry" for well over twenty years -
probably over thirty, if the totality is counted. My first job coding
was a job at the univeristy in 1985. In FORTRAN. (Yeah I'm old.) And
for nearly thirty years I've been fortunate enough to be continuously
employed as a software engineer.

If you talk to any career counselor who reviewed the course of my
career, they would have one main objection to my career management -
my network. My network sucks. I have fewer than two hundred LinkedIn
contacts. I don't follow the advice to accept all invites from
headhunters. I don't make a point to send out notes "just to touch
base" to my old contacts. I eat lunch at my desk, which is just as
well because everyone else at my office is too busy to actually sit
down and talk. If I collect a bunch of business cards at a convention
or a Meetup event, they go into a drawer, never to be looked at again. If a
career counselor were to look at my activities, they would tell me
"back to the drawing board" and send me to yet another workshop on
networking. Once again, I would find myself sitting in a small
continuing-ed class where a perky lecturer tells me and fifteen other
people that the problem with "you IT folk" is that we don't prioritize
relationships and pressing the flesh and keeping in touch with a
healthy network of people.

For years I was game for this advice, and thought I was flawed for doing
a terrible job with this stuff and being spectacularly unsuccessful
at it. Or that I was "doing it all wrong," or personally
unlikeable, and that's why it failed. After all, one reason I'm in
engineering is I'm not a "people person," and I'd always been
self-conscious of my ostensible lack of social skills.  

Then I
realized - _nobody else seems to be doing this stuff either_. If
people were doing this, I'd be getting emails from old colleagues
myself. I'd be hearing about people doing these activities. And these
MeetUp groups I attend would have hundreds of people, not just a
handful of unemployed engineers looking for leads in their job
hunt. I'd get pleny of suggestions to get together for lunch.
There is are only two possible explanations I could think of. One was
that I really am uniquely unpopular; possible, but unlikely, given that
my competition is other engineers. The other is possibility is
far more likely: nobody
does this stuff. Not even the successful people.

After thirty years in the business, I'm ready to take a different
attitude. That is: maybe the "networking stuff," the stuff they keep
telling you to do in all these workshops, just doesn't matter. That's
the real reason nobody else seems to be doing it.

Let's take a step back, and put some of the ostensible benefits and
habits of networking under the microscope, as it pertains to careers
_in software development_:

CLAIM: A strong network is key to getting the "inside track" on any
job.

REALITY: If you have a lot of people in your network, AND they know
you well enough to know how good you are, THEN they can recommend
you for recruitment. That is it.

Solid technology firms pay a lot of attention to recruitment. They
know that the primary mistake made in recruitment is a result of bias
of various sorts - bias towards people who "look like" programmers;
bias towards people based on personality; bias towards "in groups";
and this bias results in judgment errors that result in a bad decision
to hire. The problem isn't the fact that this screens out good
candidates, but the opposite - not doing this is what makes bad hires possible.
The result is that most good firms will run everyone through the same
screening process, "inside track" or no. This may even include the
dreaded resume screening! This isn't to screw over whitey or make HR
happy; it's to ensure they didn't make the same mistake with you that
they made with
_that guy_ who checked all the boxes and got in through the inside
track, only to find out he (it's always a he, somehow) couldn't
deliver. And if you do find someplace eager to give you an "inside
track," it's a red flag; it means they're so eager to staff up that
they're willing to recruit any warm body. So on balance, a strong
network is only slightly better than a search on stack overflow jobs
site.

CLAIM: A strong network is insurance. These are people who will stick
with you through thick and thin.

REALITY: LOL

Sorry, I'll try again:

REALITY: Don't confuse network with "friend and family." Professional
relationships are business relationships.

One of the problems with networking is it is just so fuzzy what the
"network" is; nobody seems to be talking about the same thing when
they talk about "your network." However, I think I can feel safe claiming
that for
the purposes of "networking," your professional network consists of
the people in LinkedIn who you actually know well or used to work
with, not the headhunters you accepted invites from three years ago
when you were unhappy with your job. So, maybe fifty to a hundred
people. While this is a large-ish group, this is not the small 
handful of people you keep up with, that you'd be
friends with whether or not you had a business relationship.

So what's the reality of this network? Whether you're in touch 
with them or not, whether
they thought about you last week or not for years, the people in your
network can help you only if they have something to give you, and you
can help them only if you have somethign to give them. In engineering,
there are exactly two ways you can help someone professionally:

1. Particular technical expertise they cannot get anywhere else;
2. Job leads, or hiring recommendations.

It is highly unlikely you or they hold any amazing degree of #1. Blame
Stack Overflow in particular, and the internet in general. Technical
expertise is a great thing to have, but unless you intend to be hire
someone, then (and I can't believe I'm writing this) you're better of with
an internet search than you are firing off an email to a "warm contact."
If you talk to an expert in person or over email, they are
likely to be irritated if you didn't do the internet search first
anyway - and if you didn't find it on the internet search, they
probably don't know either. So much for using your network to help
your career!

That leads to #2 - using your network for job and hiring
leads. _But employment prospects among technology firms are very
highly correlated._ That means it's very unlikely that others are
hiring when you're laid off, and vice versa. That's why your network
didn't help you in the past, and won't help you get hired in the
future. Perhaps the only thing is if they know people they think are
worth hiring - in which case, you hardly need to be a "warm contact"
for them to send them your way.

CLAIM: A strong network is key to keeping a technically vital career,
by keeping you in touch with experts in the field.

REALITY: Acquaintance with said expert will not rub fairy dust on you.

You can always tell the experts in the field: they're the one
publishing the papers. Or authoring the blog posts. Or giving talks at
conferences. Guess what? You can benefit from all of those
things. Without having to "cold call" the expert - or even have them know
you exist. You may need to interact with these people - once. If you
have experts in your network (and I have a few) then that's good of
course - and if you're an expert they may even reach out to you. But
software development at the expert level is pretty specialized. It
takes effort to maintain a relationship, and the odds that you need
their particular expertise at any given time over the span of years
are low. The claim is that networking makes it unnecessary to ever "cold
call" anyone, but it may be more efficient to just... get better at
cold calling experts.

No need to pick up golf, either: I bet the expert sucks at golf, like
you, and have a better use for green fees.

CLAIM: You need to constantly refresh your contacts by reaching out to
them consistently, to keep the relationship "warm."

REALITY: Unless you have an ongoing business relationship, you are
creating junk mail.

I once listened religiously to a business-oriented podcast which
claimed that as a professional, your favorite key combination should be
ctrl+shift+M. I immediately thought "what the heck does _that_ do in
emacs?", but it's nothing of the sort. It's the "Compose new message"
shortcut in outlook. The idea is that whenever you're idle and
have nothing to do, you should shoot an email to someone, just to keep
them as a "warm contact."

I've tried this exercise a few times over the years, both for
networking or not. A long time ago (like, ninties), it actually
worked, as people only got email from someone they personally knew,
and an email from someone you hadn't heard from in a while was a
novelty. Back then, I might get half my emails responded to. Now I get replies to
a tenth of them at most. Said replies usually consist of a sentence
fragement, no matter how carefully-crafted my email was with
"conversation starters." If I use email instead of a program like
LinkedIn, I'll get a several email bounces too. "So what?" you may
think. "That's a start to a relationship." Relationship or no, there
are plenty of people who don't really want to carry on a conversation
or an email thread unless you have something to talk about, and
all of those people work in engineering. (Ok, that's a joke. Only half
those people are in engineering; the other half work in finance.)

Think at it from another angle - I know for a fact my wife has an
inbox with 15,000 unread emails; she just scans subjects for anything
important, and everything else sits unopened. She is a far more 
typical email user than I am, with my
"zero inbox" anal retentative style. You're just contributing to piles
of unread email like that.

Casual lunchtime dates are the same way. People are usually happy to
see you for the first time in years, but unless you have a reason to
maintain an ongoing relationship, you'll find that people keep getting
"busy at work" and the lunch catch-ups will end.

----------------------------------------------

If these techniques don't work, why are these recommendations so
popular? Why do you keep hearing about them? I strongly suspect that
these networking practices do work great for some people. Which
people? Why, people who do career counseling and professional
coaching for engineers, that's who! Think about it: the email checkins, the
"business lunch" to catch up, the "face time" with experts, hopping
from one "networking event" to another: these are exactly the
practices that are necessary for those who work in self-employed, people-oriented
professions. Those are professions where one's professional
effectiveness and ability to stay employed depend on your personality
and physical presence, not on any particular expertise. Networking is
vitally important, because there are all sorts of people who could
otherwise fill your role, and the main thing you have to bring to the
table are your connections and relationships with other people, not on
any particular technical expertise. Does this sound like career coaching?
Yes. Does it sound like engineering?  NOOOOOOO.

The conclusion I have is: **The networking practices that work in
your field are going to be dramatically different than in other fields
and industries. So much so, that I doubt that there is a single thing
called "networking" consisting of techniques that can successfully be
applied across all fields and industries.**

So enough of being negative. Are there practices that actually do
work?
