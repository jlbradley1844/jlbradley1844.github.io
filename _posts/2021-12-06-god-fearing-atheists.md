In my aimless internet browsing the other day, I ran over this
article/editorial/blog post:
https://salon.com/2021-06-05/how-the-new-atheists-merged-with-the-far-right-a-story-of-intellectual-grift-and-abject-surrender.
This article with notable, if only for elaborating its contents right
inside the hyperlink itself. It's probably not ideal for Baha'is to share
this because it's essentially backbiting - the article is a takedown of
many individual personalities in the "new atheist" movement. So I haven't
made it clickable. 

One reason I'm bringing it up is because it confirms my suspicion of
the entire animus of this and similar movements.
But the other reason is the professed shock and disappointment in the 
author's tone. You can feel his disappointment that his heroes didn't
"know better."

The "new atheist" movement was and is an internet-famous movement of
atheistic intellectuals that gained traction in the nineties and additional
noteriety after the terrorist 9/11 attacks. Their point of contention
was not simply that God did not exist, but that religion itself was a
force for harm. Rather than simply humbly suggest that the concept of
God was unprovable and could harm moral growth if taken at its most
obvious, primitive definition - something that Buddhists have done for
centuries - the New Atheists went much further. They argued that religion
itself was harmful, that it was uniquely responsible for evils in the
world, and that educating children in religious beliefs was a form
of child abuse.

This message found a lot of appeal for atheists who bore a lot of
anger at religious people; initially, with the fundamentalists Christians
who generally sided against them politically, and later, with the
psychopathic variant of Islam of Al-Qaida and later ISIS. Many atheists
were impatient with the slow secularization of American society and
were happy to find a movement that happily glorified the destruction of their
imagined enemies.

One thing this movement didn't do was change any minds. Most religious critics
found their points much more weakly argumented than most other
religious critiques. Their main appeal was emotional. The New Athesists
were not really new, and were only atheistic by happenstance; instead, they
were simply secular-minded individuals who had managed to tap 
into the same vein of resentful tribalism that
generations of fanatical clergy had mined for centuries, arguing that
their intellectual enemies were not simply wrong, but in fact evil
and less than human and must be eliminated to ensure salvation of
the human race.

And while the Salon article conveys a sense of shock at the downfall of
many of the leaders of the movement, I'm a little bit less surprised.
I suspecy all similar movements are in for a rough time with their leaders.

-----------------------------------------------

This article restates a common canard - that those professing secular beliefs
are more intelligent, moral and civic minded than their more religious fellow
Americans. While I profess skepticism, let's just suppose for argument's sake
that this is true; due to the more "enlightened" nature of atheists,
they make better moral judgments, have firmer committments to justice,
righteousness and fairness, are pleasant to be around, and are
just sooooo good looking.
If that was truly the case, then yes, the author of this article is quite
right to be shocked that the prime movers in the New Atheism moment are
not quite as enlightened as he makes this out to be. 

Yet I suspect his reaction, and
the reaction of the Salon readers the article targets, is one of projection.
"I am an atheist, I am moral, ergo all atheists are moral, and to be otherwise
is to betray your cause." Unfortunately, there is no reason this should be
the case.

From the point of view of philosophy, you can find plenty of atheistic
philosophers who do not subscribe to
Dewey's civic virtues of democracy.
Philosopher John Gray, who seems to be a pessimist in both
a personal and philosophical sense, has written regarding the fact that
there is nothing about atheism, as a philosophy, that is inculcating of the
sort of left-of-center, pro-democratic, pro-enlightenment ideals that the bulk
of American atheists seem to hold dear. For every enlightenment Voltaire
held up as an example,
you seem to have a more nihilist Nietzche skulting around the corner. The
Rawlsian version of Justice, a quasi-platonic ideal so beloved by many atheists,
is no more genuinely representative of atheistic thought than Ayn Rand, an
atheistic philosopher whose main accomplishment has been to collect lots
of authoritarian Christians as follows and thereby show the emptiness
and shallowness of their Christian belief.

Any atheist reading this will probably think "so what". All that does is
show that atheists can be bad, just as religious people can be bad. Likewise,
there can be good atheists, just as their are good religious people (even if 
your snottier atheists are loath to admit to that fact).
From the point of view of Baha'is though, the existence of athests who, themselves,
feel that atheists that hold themselves to high moral standards and expect
other atheists to do so poses a conundrum.

Baha'i writings strongly indicate that religious people are - or at least
should be - demonstrably _better_ people than their atheistic or agnostic
relgious brethren. Yet this is not the case.
Baha'i writings can explain part of the picture - the presence of religious fanatics
who outwardly "clamorously assert their belief in the cause" but yet
inwardly seem to be
entirely lacking "fear of God" - they seem to have no sense
of shame or moral compass regulating their behavior. Baha'i writings indicate
these are not "relgious" people at their core, and while atheists may contend
that this is the "no true Scotsman" fallacy, the distinction between those
who sincerely practice religion and those who use it as a shell to hide their
lack of moral behavior is a real distinction, one that could not be clearer
in the writings.

However, what is not discussed so much in the Baha'i faith is an exposition of the
converse. That is, why is it that you do have atheists living the sort of
lives that seem so Christian in their ideals? Why do they think all other
atheists should be inclined to do the same? Why would they adopt
strict moral codes willingly? What to make of all of the "God-fearing
atheists" working for rightness and justice?

Some of this is simply a problem of association. Those who are atheists and
anti-relgious are sometimes driven to make public condemnations of the religious
for purposes of ridicule and disdain only. Yet I doubt that's the majority of
the New Atheists. Instead, there is a core belif of many atheists
that the problem is not religion as it is the behavior of the fanatical
religious leaders that many blindly follow, and that the problem is serious enough
that extermination of religious belief is the lesser of two evils. 
For such people, their alignment with atheistic concerns
are due to _moral_ concerns. Unfortunately, this is a rather self-selecting
group. There also happen to be plenty of atheists who don't hang out with such folk.
Many followers of
Ayn Rand are happily atheist and happily amoral, yet they're unlikely support
left-leaning atheistic causes and they are not driven to expose
the foibles of the religious for moral reasons. In fact, they may be very
happy being surrounded by religious people, since they often know how to
fleece such people for material gain.

And therein lies the problem. The followers of the New Atheists often
feel they have constructed a philosophy completely secular and enlightened
in nature _ex nihilo_; a result of pure logic and thought, with no
religious foundations. Unfortunately, they come to this station through
an inheritance they have very much taken for granted.

Many of the atheists in this contry have quite a heritage: a reasonably just
government, healthy civic virtues from educated parents, a society in
which people mostly obey laws, even those they could easily break and
get away with, and inculcation into the enlightentment-era concept of
"equality of all." Many of these are bounties of centuries of virtues and
concepts popularized by religions; there has been no society raised just
without the influence of religious morals. If secularism were truly
superior, than surely the more secular societies would be more peaceful
and virtuous. Unfortunately, this stability may be short-lived. There are
plenty of secular societies backsliding away from these concepts. As
for more religious societies which are also backsliding, we know who to
thank for that:

>           (Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 95)

My guess is as much as the "brights" might resist the characterization
of their own moral ideals as equivalent to one's
faith in a deity, most atheists who live their lives morally do so
for reasons that are entirely spiritual, if not religious - enshrining
such virtues as justice, fairness and equity as north stars for
their own conduct. Philosophically
these have little to do with atheism per se, and part of the reason so
many atheistic philosophers are busy with ethics is to try to build
a "castle in the sky" of virtuous conduct without any grounding in
religious faith. To my mind, this requires the sort of leap of faith
and lack of warrant that many atheists look askance at when applied
to religious believers.

For that reason, as a Baha'i, I generally don't treat atheists with
caution and don't regard them as alien. Rather, I relate to God-fearing atheists much better
than I relate to "those who clamorously assert their allegiance to
their Faith" yet seem to carry no fear of God in their actions. And
I'm not going to drag a hoary old proof of God and flog it to atheists;
but then again, nor will I let them browbeat me out of my beliefs. Which
honestly, is something not one atheist has ever tried, which is
something I can't say about many of people who are "religious".
