# How to Baha'i (for seculars and skeptics)

## Or: Baha'i for the Non-Believer

I try to write this blog for others - whoever may stumble across
it. But I have to write about what I know, which narrows things
down quite a bit. What do I know about? Well, software engineering,
music (jazz mostly), and perhaps a less popular topic,
philosophy and religion. That rules out a bunch of people who
have no interest in any of those things.

This, then, is none of those things. It's a series of self-improvement
columns. Why? Because I'm writing this for you, whoever you are.

This series is about how to improve your life, by incorporating
some ideas for a religion you've never heard of.

Why would you do this, though? This is something people did in
the seventies, not now. Nowadays, the most common attitude toward
such movements is... well, not un-spiritual, but
certainly not spiritual in the sense of "in tune with the universe" and
"seeking the eternal one" and "following God in all its forms"
and _Woooooooooo_. I'm guessing most of you aren't into sitting around with
their thoughts and deeply meditating and roaming the astral plains.
This is particuilarly true if you're like the New Yorkers I deal with on a regular
basis. They don't pray to something they regard as a Babylonian Sky God and
bristle at the notion at the mention of worship of any entity.

However, for all this talk about people getting more "secular" and
less religious, certain religious practices are as popular as ever.
We just don't think of them as religious, because they've been divorced
from the religion from which they sprung. If you've practiced meditation,
or yoga, or have gone a spiritual retret - you've done these things.
Indeed, most of what passes for self-improvement has spiritual
roots.

So for most of you, I'm guessing if you then have any use for 
religion it's self-development. Or more
to the point, if you find yourself having to listen to a spiritual leader, your
attitude is:

    Just shut up and tell me how to improve myself. Otherwise
    let me make up my own mind.

I'm a member of the Baha'i Faith. You probably haven't heard of anyone
converting to the Baha'i Faith lately. That's something that happened... in
the seventies. And quite a few of the Baha'is I know think Americans now
are too "secular" to be interested in these teachings.
I disagree, if only because, truth be told, I tend to of a rather skeptical
outlook, yet I've hung with it for years. What's kept me going is several
distinctive practices. But also because the increasingly secular viewpoint
hasn't kept other religions from drawing interest.

Perhaps the most popular exception is Buddhism. 
What the popularizers of Buddhism stumbled across is that meditation and
the cultivation of certain attitudes is what Buddhism had to offer to
Americans, both religious and non religious. As a result, people can
practice these things and meditate on these philosophies, without signing
up to being a Buddhist at any given time. Now, if
you want to call yourself a Buddhist, by all means learn and practice it
in its fullness, but _anyone_ can benefit from that practice, Buddhist
or not.

I'm making a similar bet. I'm betting that if you _practice_ the 
Baha'i Faith, you can benefit
from it and eventually recognize some deeper truths, without forcing
yourself at any time to bury reasonable doubts about any religious path.
If I have an ulteriour motive in writing this, it's only because I hope
that some of you, upon practicing, may one day be moved to associate
yourself with the Baha'i community on a deeper level.
So even for those of you who care not a whit about spirituality, I'll tell
you what I know. How to "Do Baha'i" without actually being Baha'i. Happy
Baha'ing!
