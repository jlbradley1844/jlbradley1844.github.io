## Nonviolent Practices

### Or: "Hitting other kids is bad, m'kay?"

Let's start by talking about the practice that Baha'is are probably
known for - nonviolence. In this blog post I'll talk about the easy
part of peacefulness: physical nonviolence.

*What's the practice here? Probably the simplest one I'm going
to cover in this series. Don't get into fights or altercations. Don't
go *looking* for fights. Don't do activities that tempt you into violence.
Seek nonviolent resolutions to conflicts.*

This is probably something you're doing already. What's so distinctively
"Baha'i" about it?

Well that's my interpretation - actual Baha'i laws are simpler than this,
with a few particular points. You are forbidden to intentionally
strike or wound a person or engage in violent confrontations and conflict, 
and and you are refrain from carrying arms unless essential. That's essentially
it, except for two somewhat distinctive regulations:

* Lethal arms may not be kept in the house, except in conditions of social
  unrest.

* Baha'i youth are advised to register as conscienscious objectors for
  draft registration, to allow them to be placed in non-combat positions
  should their draft be necessary. (In other words, our problem is not that
  we won't serve, it's that we won't serve in positions that require us to
  ~~murder~~ shoot others. You're free to put yourself in a position where
  you're being shot at. :-D) I've known Baha'is in the armed
  forces, and they were all medics.

If that were it, though, that would make our outlook unusual, but it wouldn't
be unique. Plenty of believers
of all Faiths believe in physical nonviolence at its core. Indeed, Baha'i views
are moderate compared to some creeds. Self-defense is permitted, as is the use
of physical force to prevent injustice.

More important than laws is the culture of peacefulness taught by Baha'u'llah, 
the central figure
of the Baha'i Faith and its main prophet. Thanks to his teachings, the Baha'i Faith
has its reputation as a peace-loving religion. Indeed, one
of the first religious laws Baha'u'llah declared after his mission was the forbidding
of any religious warfare. As said by the Universal House of Justice, the supreme
deliberative bond of the Baha'is: "Bahá'u'lláh has stated that is 
preferable to be killed in the path of God's good-pleasure than to 
kill, and that organized religious attack against Bahá'ís should never turn 
into any kind of warfare." (Extract from a 1968 letter.) 
Aside from the laws mentioned above,
there is a general culture of nonviolence among those practicing these teachings. 
Hunting among Baha'is is infrequent
(though not forbidden), and it is not usual to find Baha'i families that won't buy
toy guns for their kids and shield their children from violent media and sanction
them for getting into unnecessary fights.

Lest I mislead you, it is not correct to
think of Baha'is as pacifist, or even strictly nonviolent.

And Baha'i teaching are that violence can sometimes be necessary :

> A hitherto untranslated Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá, however, points out
> that in the case of attack by robbers and highwaymen, a Bahá'í should
> not surrender himself, but should try, as far as circumstances permit,

> indicates that in an emergency when there is no legal force at hand to
> appeal to, a Bahá'í is justified in defending his life. In another letter
> the Guardian has further pointed out that the assault of an irresponsible
> assailant upon a Bahá'í should be resisted by the Bahá'í, who would be
> justified, under such circumstances, in protecting his life.

> The House of Justice does not wish at the present time to go beyond the
> guidelines given in the above-mentioned statements. The question is
> basically a matter of conscience, and in each case the Bahá'í involved
> must use his judgment in determining when to stop in self-defense lest
> his action deteriorate into retaliation.

This writer recalls other historical incidents reported of Abdu'l-Baha
(Baha'u'llahs son, a central figure of the Baha'i Faith) where he spoke of the need
to physically intervene on behalf of others being assaulted. These interventions
are NOT for punishment or vengeance, but to prevent
physical injury or further injustice.

------------------

People who first encounter the Baha'i Faith generally have no problem with
this, but sometimes raise objections on two particular things: the avoidance of
arms, and our teachings about warfare. Frequently, discussions of this nature
get entagled into discussions of cultural beliefs and politics, and that's
something I wish to avoid in these blog posts, particularly since that's a bit removed
from actual behaviors that will make you a better person.

If you are one of those people who have a gun (or several) at home, no Baha'i
is ever going to ask you to give that up. As far as what happens if you "open carry"
a gun into a Baha'i meeting, I really don't know, since I'm not sure it's ever
been done.

But here's what I can tell you, based on my own limited experience.
I live in an affluent suburb of New York city.
Given the crime rate, there is no reason for me to have any sort of deadly
weapons. We do infrequently have coyote sightings, and I suppose our defense
against them is the fact that there are a fair number of tiny yappy dogs in the 
neighborhood, and if a coyote does wander into this neighborhood, they will find
those dogs to be much easier prey than my
children, who are now large and indigestible. So, no need for guns. But if I
lived in a rural area where the 911 response time was on the order of a half-hour,
then yeah, personally, I'd have a shotgun *just in case*.

But my feeling is that if you study the Baha'i teachings and you do have arms,
you should consider why you have them. Personally, my own opinion is that
America is a much safer place that many people are inclined to believe. And you're
free to regard my attitude as nothing but empty hubris, borne of the fact that
I lived in New York city for five years without any incidents - not even 
being accosted by a hobo.
Perhaps if I lived in the fictional New York of the network television shows 
I grew up watching in the seventies I'd feel otherwise. (Indeed, plenty 
of the people I grew up with, who had never actually
visited New York, seemed to think that John Carpenter's 80's move *Escape from New York*
was a documentary.)

Baha'is view on nonviolence essentially comes from our view on human nature.
We believe that people are essentially peace-loving and cooperative in nature,
and our laws and teachings are aimed at cultivating this nature.
Unfortunately, many people, who will insist that they themselves
are nonviolent, still cling to a worldview that accepts violence as a necessary
part of it and think that the human race is somehow fatally doomed to violent
conflict. Baha'is don't believe that's the case, and many raised as Baha'is have trouble
even wrapping their head around this world view.

Supposing you're on a first date
with someone you're hoping to get serious with, and your date says
something like this:

>  Raising kids are hard. It's no wonder so many people engage in child abuse.

Some of you might appreciate this morbid bit of humor, but you'd wonder about
your date's suitability as a potential partner. Why? Because this 
is not the view of someone
who likes being around children. Yet, supposing your date instead
said something like this:

>  History tells us humans are violent. The idea of a world without warfare seems
>  quite naive.

Whether or not you agreed with this sentiment,
you'd probably chalk it up to the world-weary cynicism that comes from
college-level study of European history or from watching too much BBC World News, and not
give it another thought. But Baha'i teachings regard this viewpoint as deeply 
misanthropic and an
impediment to the serious resolution of problems in this world.
One of the goals of the Baha'i Faith is to create societies in which not only
physical violence is unacceptable, but even warfare is considered unacceptable.
The idea that humankind is somehow fundamentally
morally broken breeds passivity and inaction in the face of problems that can 
and should be fixed.

I could write much further on the subject, but others have already done a much
better job than I would. You now know Baha'i practices around physical nonviolence.
But the next blog post
may be a little more interesting. It's about Baha'i practices for refraining from *non-physical*
forms of violence.
