## More on Peacefulness: Verbal Nonviolence

The "not hitting other people" is a pretty easy part of peacefulness.
Everyone agrees using physical violence on others as a tool of
persuasion is barbaric and immoral, and when people quibble with that,
it's usually because they'd like to use physical violence in the
sort of made-up Hollywood storybook scenes where they get to look
like a good guy simply because they had a firearm handy.

If that were all there were about violence, then the Baha'i Faith
would have little to say. It should come as no surprise to you - there
is a lot more. Nonviolence in your actions means nonviolent in speech,
writing and other behaviors as well.

Let's start with speech.

People generally are brought up to only watch out for one particularly
troublesome form of speech: calumny. Everyone is taught not to lie, but in
reality calumny is what is really sanctioned in society - lying about someone's
misdeeds to discredit someone, or protect oneself or protect another at the
expense of a victim you care less about. But outside of 
that, many societies don't consider any verbal mischief of particular consequence.

But if you reflect, you can do a lot of harm with speech even without committing
false witness. One
of the most important lessons of
of the Baha'i writings is to become much more careful
with your speech. In effect, refrain from verbal violence as you would physical
violence. 

There are things that can be just as damaging as calumny in
certain respects.
Probably the most serious misuses of language in society is backbiting - the
habit of speaking ill of others who are not present. 
Many Baha'is know these writings by heart:

> O Son of Being! How couldst thou forget thine own faults and busy 
> thyself with the faults of others? Whoso doeth this is accursed of Me.

> O Son of Man! Breathe not the sins of others so long as thou art
> thyself a sinner. Shouldst thou transgress this command, accursed
> wouldst thou be, and to this I bear witness."
                       -- Baha'u'llah, _The Hidden Words_

> ...backbiting quencheth the light of the heart, and extinguisheth 
   the life of the soul.
                       -- Baha'u'llah, _The Book of Certitude_

These aren't simply words taken out of context.
One of the most distinguishing features of devoted Baha'is is that they
generally don't backbite - and they may even act evasive when they need
to thruthfully report on someone else's ill behavior.

Backbiting - discussing the faults of others not present - is a nasty habit.
And it's easy to fall into. Like the air we breathe, it's so pervasive
that it escapes notice. People think of backbiting as being nasty to a friend
behind their back, or going right up to the line of misleading accusations,
but those are simply the easiest examples. Think of half of the
commentary on social media - ridicule and scorn are commonly heaped on
all sorts of people in society. Other ethnicities, religions, political movements,
people residing in other locations, entire populations are regularly
abused without regard to one's firsthand knowledge of the situation.
Your entire Facebook feed may consist mostly of backbiting - "viral posts"
shared among like-minded people trashing others who will never see that
slander because it won't show up in the feed. Indeed, the ads in your
feed may very well fit in with the same sorts of slanders.

"It isn't backbiting if it's the truth" is the common riposte when one
wants to justify backbiting. Perhaps _you_ think it's the truth. But
are you backbiting because it needs to be said? Or are you just attacking
a person or a group of people you don't like? Or worse yet, are you trying
to bond with someone else over shared resentments, regardless of who else's
reputation you are trying to trash?

If you're serious about self-improvement, then the
person you focus on improving should be... yourself. Concerning ourselves
with the faults of others takes your focus off of that. If someone is causing
you problems, then a painful communication may be necessary, but that's
still under your initiative. If, however, you simply dislike something
about a person and wish to vent about it, it's better to let those feelings go.

Sometimes backbiting is defended as simply "venting." About that...
I'm old enough to remember some of the self-help
fads from the seventies and eighties. It was at one time thought that
venting would lessen aggression. You'd have therapists set up sessions where
you'd punch things (not the therapist) or do "primal screaming" and wreck
your voice. (This would be in addition to spending a hundred
bucks so you could yell to your therapist about your upbringing for
fifty minutes). Now none of this is really backbiting, since the therapist
is under confidentiality, but it isn't terribly helpful either.
The worst example of this I can thin of was the farcical
"radical candor" movement, which taught
people to speak whatever was on their mind, however cruel and abusive.
The results of all of these venting "therapies" were as bad as they were
predictable. *Venting increases aggression and anger; it doesn't lessen it.* 
The goal was to to make oneself feel
better by unburdening oneself and drain the agression of its power; but in 
reality, venting itself proved to be
a bad habit that built on itself, as people spent more and more time tapping
into the things that made them angry and violent.

Of course, sometimes backbiting isn't really backbiting.
There are situations where there really is a need to report on the
ill behavior of others. The motive matters most of all. In many cases, it's obvious
when something is backbiting or communication in search of a solution, and most 
people can instinctively
tell the difference. In any event, speaking directly to the person you have
an issue with solves most problems. Otherwise, the old advice is the best: if you can't say anything nice, 
don't say anything at all.

The obvious exception to all of this is when you need to modify someone's
behavior and you cannot talk speak to them personally about it.
For instance, it may be unsafe or unwise to
confront him or directly. In this case, one must talk to someone who
can do something about it, venting to unrelated third parties won't help. 
In such cases, the best thing to do is act like you're 
giving a police report: state
the actions and what you saw - nothing but the facts. You can give the
unvarnished truth without using loaded language. Tell only the objective
truth. Not only does this avoid edging into backbiting, it makes you more
credible to the listener and allows you emotionally detach from the situation.

So much for backbiting and fault-finding. But that's not all; other
less abusive forms of verbal violence are also to be avoided.
Less problematic, but still an issue, is the coarse nature of much 
casual communication nowadays.

>   For the tongue is a smoldering fire, and excess of speech a deadly poison. 
>   Material fire consumeth the body, whereas the fire of the tongue devoureth 
>   both heart and soul. The force of the former lasteth but for a time, 
>   whilst the effects of the latter endureth a century.

>   Be fair in thy judgment, and guarded in thy speech.

>   Henceforward everyone should utter that which is meet and seemly, and should 
>   refrain from slander, abuse and whatever causeth sadness in men.

>   One word may be likened unto fire, another unto light, and the influence 
>   which both exert is manifest in the world. Therefore an enlightened man of 
>   wisdom should primarily speak with words as mild as milk...


One may avoid ridicule and derision, yet still communicate in a harsh manner.
Think of why you're speaking. Your message will be better received if it
isn't delivered in a cloud of angry invective. The Baha'i
path urges moderation in all things, including tone of speech.

There is still a place for criticism, and one may
say negative things about the faults of others when that person is present.
But it must be done in the right tone, particularly if you are the person
in authority. Do your words convey patience and forbearance, or impatience
and anger? Your words and attitude must convey that you're presenting 
yourself as someone who
sees a fault in someone and is hopeful that the recepient is a good person
wo will change its ways. In the case of the latter, the recipient will not
hear the criticism, but instead react to its emotional content, which
more often than not simply says "I'm angry with you."
This can provoke a number of reactions, none of which
address what you'd like to do - address a fault.

### Media and Social Networking

If you don't want to use negative speech, I imagine you don't want
to be hearing it either. If you want to avoid using it, you can avoid picking
it up by avoiding what is basically gossip:

>   The pages of swiftly-appearing newspapers are indeed the mirror of the world. 
>   They reflect the deeds and the pursuits of divers peoples and kindreds. 
>   They both reflect them and make them known...
>   However, it behoveth the writers thereof to be purged from the promptings of 
>   evil passions and desires and to be attired with the raiment of justice and 
>   equity. They should enquire into situations as much as possible and ascertain 
>   the facts, then set them down in writing.

>   Do not listen to anything that is prejudiced, for self-interest prompts 
>   men to be prejudiced. They are thoughtful only of their own will and purposes. 
>   They live and move in darkness.
>               (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 41)

>   Ignoring gossip and slander is a positive, constructive and healing action 
>   helpful to the community, the gossiper and to the persons slandered.

Much of the media we consume hardly counts as objective reporting. Instead,
it poses as news but is really "infotainment"; opinion disguised as news 
which seeks to engage
its listeners regardless of its newsworthiness. For many people, their feed
eventually becomes a stream of self-regarding mistruths, gossip about disliked
people and cultures, outright backbiting and selectively edited stories calculated
to outrage. 

We're at best passive participants, so nothing we do is going to "fix" this problem. The
best we can do is recognize when we are being targeted and refuse
to listen.
The goal is to prevent us from falling into habits of verbal violence. It's easier
if you eliminate the negative, disparaging, trash-talking content
of what poses as much of modern discourse. Don't bring that negativity into
your life. If you want to keep the peace, use peaceful language.

If everyone refrained from physical and verbal violence, everyone would
agree the world would be much better - without as many misunderstandings,
arguments, and stressful situations. But there's a problem: only your own
actions are under your control.
That being the case, you may wonder: what's the point of cleaning up my
behvior? How will my acting properly make others acting properly?

The answer: you have to control things under your control. And at the
very least, you won't hurt yourself by doing this. You will instead be
much happier.
