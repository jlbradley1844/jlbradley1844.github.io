## Unity

### or: STOP TRYING TO WIN

>  Illumine and hallow your hearts; let them not be profaned by the 
>  thorns of hate or the thistles of malice.
>         (Baha'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 333)

Competition has its place in society. But there is a strong case to be
made that in America, excessive competitiveness and
combativeness has become a problem. This applies both to individuals
and society as a whole.

>  In the eyes of those possessed of insight, all this conflict, contention and 
>  vainglory hath ever been, and will ever be, like unto the play and pastimes of children.
>        (Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 169)

>  A world in which naught can be perceived save strife, quarrels and corruption 
>  is bound to become the seat of the throne, the very metropolis, of Satan.
>        (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 176)

People also know that cooperation is the foundation of a civil society.
But it seems they get this message less and less over time. 
Instead, we live in a commercial and
media environment steeped in combativeness and conflict. At work, we see environments
where raises and promotions are limited not by merit, but are scarce by
design and limited to top performers. Who is a top performer? Why, those
who out-compete the others. 

If you ignore these messages at work, then
you get it from the media, which seems purposely designed to create
paranoia. From story arcs that always have a villian, to partisan news
sources that create villians out of one's neighbors, to product advertisements
aimed at making people feel small and insecure if you aren't "winning," the
fight never ends. Even in self improvement - self help books, personal
coaches, even therapists are there to help you 'fight' for what you need.
Even some religious denominations try to leverage this to influence you! Many
religious "teachers" are more than happy to tell you that
your belief, feality and obedience are all duties you must assume in a
neverending War of Good and Evil against "them" (where "them," for some reason,
are people you were disinclined to like anyway. Funny, that.)

You've probably noticed - for a lot of these people, it's in _their_ self-interest
for _you_ to keep up the fight.

### Avoiding Unnecessary Conflict

Now, let's look at how the ill effects of combativeness are combated in society.
A lot of the interest around mindfulness and yoga and self-acceptance
and all that whatnot is about reducing the ego threats you feel in
society. By guiding you into stepping back.
If you're unhappy and stressed out all the time, the implication is 
that the problem is something internal to you; we can somehow tame our reactions
to a neverending stream of threats.

But that is a bit like telling us to all wear filter masks so that others
may pollute freely.
The problem is not that you are reacting to these messages badly. The problem
is you are reacting to those messages _as if they are true_. If they really
were true, you would have every reason to be stressed out and unhappy all
the time. There's a reason all these teen dystopias seem to be about children
growing up in conflict and war with each other: because it's an absolutely
miserable way to live. It seems you don't really have dystopia without needless conflict.

The solution to turning this around is to recognize that almost all of
the conflicts people try to draw you into are _absolutely fake_(2). You are not 
surrounded by enemies. There are not people out
to hate you and hurt you. Your co-workers are not out to stab you in
the back. Crime is not out of control. You do not need to get your kid into
Harvard to guarantee a future for him or her. You are not a failure if you
fail to make your first million. Need I go on?

If you take one thing away from this article it's this: life is not a game
to be played as if there are winners and losers.

If you stop seeing everything as a conflict, you will stop swimming around in
stress hormones. It is important to train yourself to not
see conflict where it doesn't exist. And not to create enemies where there are
none.

>  Do not see any enemies. Though he be your murderer, see no enemy. Look 
>  upon him with the eye of friendship. Be mindful that you do not consider 
>  him as an enemy and simply tolerate him, for that is but stratagem and 
>  hypocrisy. To consider a man your enemy and love him is hypocrisy. This 
>  is not becoming of any soul. You must behold him as a friend. You must 
>  treat him well. This is right.
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace)

Now, you will run into people in your life that seem to think everything is
a competition. Occasionally this is just insecurity and narcissism - someone 
who needs to feel like "a winner" just to belong. However, that will account
probably for most of the overly-competitive you run across; as disagreeable
as you may find these people, it's probably a fault you need to tolerate. Those
people aren't trying to ruin others; they are just a little disagreeable and 
insecure.

Far more dangerous are the tiny handful who seem to thrive not just upon 
winning, but upon _defeating_
others. If you need to deal with such people, you need to adopt very pragmatic
strategies. And if you are in a position of power or influence, you may have to take actions
to protect others against them. But your behavior must be consistent. When you do
deal with these people, you must still deal with them fairly. And you must not
believe such people are beyond help. The inclination is
to "punish" such people whenever you can, but that just gives them a fight, something
they already thrive on and you probably don't.
If the worst happens and reasonable efforts fail, you may just simply
have to avoid such people.
