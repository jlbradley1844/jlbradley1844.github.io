## Disagreements without Combat

As indicated above, conflict is usually not a conflict when taken in the right
perspective. But you will have... how do we say... _differences_ with others. Lots
of them.

How these differences are handled matter a great deal to society. There are
right ways, and others, less right. Let's listen to the The Master on
an experience from 1912:

>  In France I was present at a session of the senate, but the experience 
>  was not impressive. Parliamentary procedure should have for its object 
>  the attainment of the light of truth upon questions presented and not 
>  furnish a battleground for opposition and self-opinion. Antagonism and 
>  contradiction are unfortunate and always destructive to truth. In the 
>  parliamentary meeting mentioned, altercation and useless quibbling were 
>  frequent; the result, mostly confusion and turmoil; even in one instance 
>  a physical encounter took place between two members. It was not consultation 
>  but comedy.
>                (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 72)


The Baha'i teachings around peacefulness would be very remiss if it did not
say what to do _instead_ of conflict. Fortunately, it does. Which leads to a
few more distinctive Baha'i practices.

The most distinctive is a group decision-making process known as _consultation_.
This is how _all_ group decision is made in Baha'i communities at all levels,
from the lowliest neighborhood group to the supreme decision-making body,
The Universal House of Justice.
Unlike a lot of other Baha'i practices, consultation evolved through the early
growth of the faith, under the guidance of the central figures of the faith;
there is not a "how-to" on this, but recommendations scattered throughout the Baha'i
writings which inform this procedure.

>  Take ye counsel together in all matters, inasmuch as consultation is the lamp 
>  of guidance which leadeth the way, and is the bestower of understanding.
>                (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 168)

Just as there is no canonical how-to on consultation, there is no "Robert's Rules of Order"
to attend to. In fact, such parliamentary procecuralism is against the spirit
of consultation. Instead, consultation works on the following _principals_:

1. This being a group decision-making process that involves all participants,
the group must be small enough to allow participation _by all_. In my opinion, 
more than a dozen people
starts to become unworkable. In Baha'i deliberative bodies, 9 is the usual number.
While we do this because of the Baha'i writings, this number has come up in business
as well, with the concept of a "two pizza team," the idea being that if you can't
feed the team with two pizzas, it's too big to keep everyone on the same page.
Now, Baha'is do have "consultation" in large numbers - think hundreds or more - but
these usually consist of open forums for brining recommendations to smaller bodies
that make the actual decisions

2. All participants must respect one another and commit themselves to the
common goal of finding a truthful outcome. Partisanship has no place in 
consultations, and those consulting must set
aside all personal feelings of loyalty to tribe and group membership or association.
Baha'is are told that participants must feel absolute love and fellowship for
one another. While this may not be possible for your group, it is doubtful consultation
will produce an outcome everyone will hold to if members of the group cannot trust
and respect one another.

3. The goal of consultation is the unfettered search for truth. Statements must be 
made in a
dispassionate way and refer to the facts at hand. Opinions and strong emotional
statements obscure the truth, intentionally or not. The strenght of one's personal
feelings may be conveyed, but remember, how you feel may not have bearing on the 
rightness or wrongness
of an idea.

>  He who expresses an opinion should not voice it as correct and right but set 
>  it forth as a contribution to the consensus of opinion,
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 72)

>  Man should weigh his opinions with the utmost serenity, calmness and composure.
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 72)

4. No self-censorship. While speakers should use tact, wisdom, 
and speak in moderation, this
does not imply self-censorship. All ideas must be offered. Good intentions must
be presumed of all partiipants, and one should not take offense when none is
intended. Participants should not try to
"read the room" when determining whether or not to bring up an idea. Doing this
leads to "groupthink," which is often the outcome of such consultations when people
self-censor.

5. All ideas are the property of the group. Once uttered, it does not make sense
to refer to something as belonging to a particular person; for instance, you
shouldn't say something like "I like John's idea," as it gives credit for the idea
to the speaker. Once a course of action is ratified, it must not be associated with
the original proponent. The idea is the property of the group, and it is the
group as a whole that promotes the idea.

>  Indeed, it has ever been the cherished desire of our Master, 'Abdu'l-BahÃ¡, that 
>  the friends in their councils, local as well as national, should by their 
>  candor, their honesty of purpose, their singleness of mind, and the thoroughness 
>  of their discussions, achieve unanimity in all things.
>             (Shoghi Effendi, Baha'i Administration, p. 80)


6. A strong effort is made to come to unanimous consensus, All members must agree on the
proposal for it to move forward. Unfortunately, a deadlock may occur. If there
are several attempts to break a deadlock and they fail, a majority vote may be
necessary to produce a final decision. In this manner, a minority who wish for no
action to be taken cannot block a course of action, since doing nothing is a course
of action.

7. Once a decision is made, the most important part of the consultation comes
after the consultation. It is this: the decision must be supported by _all_ members, 
whether or not
they agreed with the proposal during consultations. There must be 
no "sandbagging" by members who are unhappy
with a decision. When discussing their decision with others, one may not 
indicate that they did not originally
support the idea; one's personal views do not matter. One is speaking for the
group as a whole once a matter is decided.

8. Minutes may be necessary for transparency - particular if the group is making
decisions for a larger group. However, specifics of the details recorded are for the group
as a whole to decide. When it comes to individual votes, anonymity must be preserved
in the case of a majority vote; because all must support any eventual decision, who
voted for what should not matter,
Points may be taken down without reference to speakers or supporters of various
position, as members must be able to speak freely. In many cases, confidentiality is
necessy for personal safety; it may even be necessary to either record
certain comments separately so as to keep such notes in confidence.

The goal of consultation is to ensure that the group is in unity around a particular
plan of action. _The goal is NOT to reach a final decision, now and for the end
of time_. Nor is it for hashing out such fuzzy concepts as 'group mission' or
'shared values'; everyone has their own reason for being there, and such
differences do not prevent unified action in any case. It is to reach a decision
on concrete actions to be comitted to by all, _provisional on the outcome_.
By taking a unified action and watching results, it will the be much
easier to determine whether or not the right action was decided upon. In this
matter, even large mistakes by the group may be quickly corrected.

If you've reviewed consultation and you're excited enough to apply this in
your own life, _a warning_. You _cannot_ apply these to any group of people
and expect good results. Reread point number 2 above. Group participants 
all must share the same sense
of group loyalty and pure aims. In a lot of cases in "the real world," 
consultation won't
work because of either:

* Ill will or subconscious competitiveness. If someone is out to wreck an
  agenda, the consultation will not go well. Sometimes you can get outright
  combatativeness in a consultation - when this happens in Baha'i contexts, usually
  the consultation is stopped rather than continued. But that's infrequent; more
  often, you'll get the sort of passive-agressive acceptance of a consensus followed
  by subsequent actions taken to undermine the group decision.

* A power imbalance. For instance, if you're the manager at work, you won't get a consultation
  from your direct reports. You were given the authority, you're the decision maker, and
  its unwise (and unfair) to expect participants to unguardedly submit
  their uncensored opinions, particularly since
  everyone knows if you don't like the decision, you can very well unmake it.
  Everyone in the consultation must be a peer in fact, not just in some metaphorical
  sense of "we're all brothers and sisters here."

And another warning: this is a synopsis of my understanding; please _do not use this
for a reference_. If you're serious about using consultation for
decision-making in your own organizations
I recommend that you review the more authoritative writings on 
Baha'i consultation available.
Indeed, by the time you read this, there may even be Baha'i courses for this sort of thing.

If you're of a cynical sort and are now thinking "well, what good is it for?", I
will answer this question. However, it will be addressed in a subsequent post.
