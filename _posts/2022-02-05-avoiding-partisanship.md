## Non-Partisanship and Political Non-Alignment

One may look at the requirements for consultation and admire this as a
decision-making process for business and government. For government especially
comes the question: what then of the place for political parties of common 
interest? Cannot they organize to best represent their interest? Should they
not organize to defend views they consider right?

The Baha'i answer to this is clear: they can not and should not.

The reason is evident as is spelled out in the purpose of decision making.
The purpose is to serve _the group as a whole_. Now: if there was any political
party that represented both party members and non-party members, I haven't
heard of such an entity. The purpose of a political party is PARTisan; it
represents a PART of a whole, not the whole.

Since you, gentle reader, are probably not a Baha'i, you have no obligation
to change your behavior. However, my understanding of the law for Baha'is
is thus:

    One cannot belong to a political party. One cannot identify with a
    political party. One cannot even publicly take sides in
    political controversies of a partisan nature.

This may seem somewhat extreme. Most people registered to a political party
do so only for the convenience of voting in a primary. In states like New York,
party affiliation is _required_ to vote in a primary. And like other Baha'i
"laws," if a Baha'i to
entirely disregard this, they would likely never face any sanction except in
the case of a particularly egregious display of partisanship or deliberate
public flaunting of such laws.
Nevertheless, for Baha'is the only
way to avoid partisanship is to avoid aligning oneself with a party. Entirely.

This advice seems particularly relevant in today's environment. Perhaps sometime
in the mythic bipartisan past that "middle way" Washington consensus political
writers enjoy invoking, there was broad agreement across the parties
on All Things American, the parties respected the members of one another,
and all worked toward a common solution. I doubt it. And in any case, this
"bipartisanship" mostly worked by entirely avoid the issue of civil rights
(which I'll write about later).

But currently, the major driver of partisan affiliation is "negative partisanship";
that is, one affiliates with a party as a show of hatred for members of the
other party. In such a case, it is even more important to avoid such partisanship.

That's what I can say about this from the Baha'i viewpoint.

I will, however, add two
very additional problems that result when you engage in partisan conduct.

_Emotional Imblance_: Most people who engage in partisan politics _feel_
extremely strongly about something. And unfortunate as it is, many times
these feelings aren't based on something imaginary. There really are problems
that could be solved easily, were there not intransigent opposition by
a significant minority of the population, sometimes motivated by nothing
more than willful opposition for the sake of opposing.

Unfortunately for you, you do not know with any certainty that problems you
are hung up on are _actually problems_. And in any event, such things are
not under your control. If you are driven by such frustrations as to long
for gas chambers of your opponents, or even simply dream of an automated
remote-control wedgie-machine intended for such people, you are no 
longer in a position where you are thinking clearly.
Inevitably, such contempt for others leaks out into words and action, resulting
in backbiting and acts of minor agression. Slowly, one becomes a less
social person and unhappy. In the worst case, one becomes antisocial and
posts unbalanced rants from the computer in the basement.

Does that sound like a prescription for happiness? Not on your life.

_Political Hobbyism_: Another problem I have have with American democracy
I have to credit writer Eitan Hirsh identifying. The problem is as follows:
people confuse "being informed"
or "being concerned" or "arguing with strangers on the internet" as being
politically active, in the sense of participating in a democracy.

Frequently, for extreme partisans, this is all they do; following their favorite
media closely, commisserating with their fellow believers about the "outrage
of the day"; enjoying a 5-minute hate with the conforting voice on the TV.
Certainly, when one does that, one is engaging in partisan behavior. But
is this really political? Is it small-d democratic behavior?

Defenders of democracy generally note the goal is not just democracy, but
_participative_ democracy - one is not simply a constituent, but a
stakeholder who is involved in the democratic process itself.
For someone whose participation is based solely on "engagement" and
"staying informed", then the only course of action one
has is _voting_. Note that this is the same course of action available to
someone who is blissfuly ignorant of the events of the day, wanders
into the voting booth (or not), and chooses his or her candidate based on who looked more
"leadership-y" in their campaign ads.

Partisin engagement is not activism. It is political hobbyism. Actual
self-government and activism requires working with others of all beliefs
to improve how government works
for them. That includes being involved in town meetings, running for nonpartisan offices,
being engaged in organizations for social change - and I don't mean simply
venmo-ing to your favorite organization once a year.
And most importantly, listening more often than talking.
If you don't have the time to actually engage in such behaviors, then 
there is nothing wrong with that. But I claim if can't do this because
time is sort, you can gain back your precious minutes
by cutting back on your intake of 
news/infotainment/propaganda in the name of being
"informed" without actually sacrificing your ability to force change.

Before I was Baha'i I was rather "engaged" myself. The result of all my
activities is probably that I was a less agreeable person to be around. By detaching
myself from these hobbies, I gained a better sense of control of my life,
and make my reading time for fun again.

As far as changing society, the Baha'i Faith has a more practical approach
that steps aside partisanship entirely. I'll write about that in the next
column.
