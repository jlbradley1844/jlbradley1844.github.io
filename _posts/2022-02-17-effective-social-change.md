## The Baha'i Faith and Small-Scale Community Change

### Or: How to "do politics" effectively

For someone who wants to "change the world," not engaging in partisan politics
may seem strikingly ineffective. What about mass organization? What about
voting drives? What about _the big issues_?

While the Baha'i Faith does care about that, its philosophy of social change
is clear that actual change is going to come at the small scale. To be an effective
agent for social change, the place to start is _locally_.

This can really pose a problem for those who are receptive to Baha'i Teachings.
People who are idealistic enough to research
other faiths are generally drawn toward the big issues. Let's think of some Baha'i
beliefs that have drawn people to the Faith. Admittedly, some seem ridiculously
obvious now:

* Anti-racism
* Equality of men and women
* World peace and support of institutions of international cooperation
* An international tribunal to enforce peace and human rights
* Universal education
* Wise management of the earth's resources on behalf of the common good
and so on and so forth.
* The control of religious fanatacism

These all seem to be _big problems_ requiring solutions that are political,
right? Enlightened governments to enforce these things seem necessary,
doesn't it?

As far as the Baha'i Teachings, there are two problems with this.

The first is quite obvious: a religion isn't a law enforcement organization.
The less a religions forces on other people, the better. This isn't
because the Baha'i Faith is libertarian. It's simpler - to enforce laws
inevitably requires the credible threat of force in the case of noncompliance.
The Baha'i Faith isn't a law enforcement agency, and indeed, those who
lead the Baha'i Faith have a very limited purview. If we had a professional
clergy (we don't), we would still not be able to govern in the
traditional sense. When religious clergy do govern, the outcome is
disastrous. In a provisionally translated writing from Abdu'l-Baha, he
enumerates some of the disastrous episodes that resulted from religious
interference in governmental affairs, and concludes:

> Were you to refer to history, you would find innumerable, and, indeed, 
> infinite numbers of such occurrences, the cause of which in every instance 
> was the interference of religious leaders in political affairs. These souls 
> are the authorities in establishing the purport of divine laws, not with 
> regard to their implementation... Otherwise, what expertise do they have 
> in political matters, the protection of the subjects, the managing of 
> serious affairs, the welfare and prosperity of the country, the 
> implementation of the civil regulations and secular laws of a realm, 
> or foreign affairs and domestic policy?
>       (Abdu'l-Baha - Provisional Translations 'Treatise on Politics')

History shows that religions that take governmental burdens upon themselves are
inevitably corrupted by this.
The solution for religious groups - temptation, I should say - is to
outsource the arm-twisting politics and enforcement to like-minded politicians
who can do the dirty work.
For this reason, many ecclesiastes throughout history have partnered
up with secular governments to get there business done. Here, too, the
results have been disastrous.





And those are just the more obvious reasons why religions can't 
"do politics" effectively. The second
reason is a little more subtle. The Baha'i Faith is here to bring
about social change, not governmental change. There is a difference
between the two - social change is more permanent. Governmental change
cannot permanently solve the problem - because government can 
change again! Even for
a government in the most enlightened democracy, if the only thing that
keeps these changes are in place are the government, eventually the gains
are going to be lost. Why? Because governmental support does not imply
permanent support by the society.

Permanent support requires a social change. There will always be bad
actors who seek to thwart or circumvent any necessary change. What stops
them is generally not fear of law enforcement - I'm not sure any white-collar
criminal ever feared getting caught. Bad actors are usually stopped when
they cannot find enough people to be complicit in their schemes. This means
society as a whole must support these initiatives. If societal change
is incomplete, the bad actors will find a way. Only when there is
substantial buy-in from society will change be permanent.

So what do you do if you want to change the world? My modest suggestion
is aside from voting, there is little you can do to effect governmental
change. It is more effective to spend your time on social change.

In practice, this means local changes, at a small scale where you can
actuall help others effect the change they need. That is, locally,
not nationally. Yes, it does feel important to
be engaged in "the big issues." It's also woefully ineffective.

Let's look at the most recent large-scale movement for social change in
America - the movement for civil rights. (Sixty years ago. Yes, it has been 
a woefully long
time since such a movement was actually effective). The fight for civil
rights _seemed_ to be a national movement. But in fact, it was a broad-based
movement composed through the power of local civic groups, working
together. A quick study of the history of the civil rights movement will
not find any central, top-down group in charge of this; it was a mass movement
of small groups, all focused on the same goals and working together to
achieve it.

If you want to make change locally, that's something you can do something about.
You can organize people at the neighborhood, and solve problems at that level.
The more focused and local, the better. If you wish to effect national change,
the idea is still the same - many people speaking with one voice will gain a
hearing that scattered individuals would not.

Still, it is not sufficient for people to vote for faraway representatives to take
actions to then be imposed top-down on the people voted for. Instead, decisions
must be taken by the very people who are acted upon by those decisions.

This leads to another problem when people attempt to effect a social
change. More likely than not, you have a handful of things you care
deeply about. The temptation is to seek out those who care about those
particular things and... then what? Consciousnes-raise? Get together to
write letters to your representatives in the same room?

No, this too is limited. You've picked a cause based on what you deeply
care about, rather than what you actually have control over. This can be
much more than you think - but not if all you have is a handful of 
"true believers" stuck in the same situation you are.

Instead, in an honest effort to effect social change, a few things have
to happen:
- You have to survey a community or population to see what issues they
care about, that you yourself may be interested in helping with.
- You also need to review what resources you have in hand, both human
and otherwise.
- Once done, find out what the local needs are and how those resources can
be applied.
- Start small pilot projects, eventually forming an organization of social
or economic change.

Key to this, as you might guess, is consultation, using the process mentioned
earlier.

This process is not new, but you aren't going to read about it in the
Baha'i writings; Baha'u'llah himself wrote nothing of it. But if you read
Baha'i _history_, well here we have a wealth of information.
