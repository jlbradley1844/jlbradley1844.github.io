## Not Tribalism, Not Populism. Fanaticism.

It can be easy to overlook something when it takes a form you do not
expect. Such is the case with religious fanaticism, or fanaticism in
general. It is easy to miss when it doesn't take the form you expect.

What does a religious fanatic look like? You're probably thinking of
the people who flew the airplanes into twin towers. Terrorists of
various stripes. Loud street preachers, probably with mental problems,
haranguing people on the subways. Members of new religious movements
agressively recuriting people on street corners. The loopy-loo guy in
your old student co-op full of batty theories about quantum theory and
spirits. Political fanatics? The odd leftists that your daughter hangs
out with in college, her friends who insist Bernie Sanders is a
sellout, maybe communists - if those still exist. On the
other hand, you probably can't think of anyone you know and hang out
with, not even among your "facebook friends," can you?

Some of this is just a form of *othering*. I'd be willing to bet that
when you think of fanatics, you think of believers in other religions,
or political movements far removed from anything you learned about in
civics. If you grew up white and Catholic for instance, your rigid Catholic aunt
who keeps inisisting your baby needs to be baptized, or your
cousin who moved deep into the country to avoid the "pagen" cities,
or your great-uncle who thinks the problem with this country is
too many of "those people" being allowed to vote... that's just them
being *them*. But you'd never think of them as being fanatics.

To some extent, this is probably healthy. It isn't up to us to judge
anyone; we have no business evaluating the spiritual health of
others. Probably for the best if we look at everyone with a
sin-covering eye, since no one knows if one's motives are truly pure
or not. And of course the opposite problem, claiming everyone you disagree
with is an unthinking fanatic, is far worse.

As a result, it makes fanaticism hard to see when it really
does become a pervasive problem - even worldwide. And that seems to be
the point the world is at.

--------------------------------

This development is no surprise to those of us who are Baha'is.
Baha'is are repeatedly reminded of the dangers of fanaticism,
and particularly religious fanaticism:

>   Religious fanaticism and hatred are a world-devouring fire, whose
>   violence none can quench.

>   (Baha'u'llah, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 14)

>   In matters of religion every form of fanaticism, hatred,
>   dissension and strife is strictly forbidden.

>   (Baha'u'llah, Tabernacle of Unity)

>   A new religious principle is that prejudice and fanaticism whether
>   sectarian, denominational, patriotic or political are destructive
>   to the foundation of human solidarity; therefore man should
>   release himself from such bonds in order that the oneness of the
>   world of humanity may become manifest.

>   (Abdu'l-Baha, Baha'i World Faith - Abdu'l-Baha Section, p. 247)

>   Schools must first train the children in the principles of
>   religion... but this in such a measure
>   that it may not injure the children by resulting in ignorant
>   fanaticism and bigotry.

>   (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 68)

Baha'i writings frequently decry fanaticism, and the early clerical
opponents of the Baha'i Faith are frequently labeled as fanatics; so
much so, that one of a skeptical mindset is tempted to think the
reason Baha'is described their clerical opponents as fanatical is
*because* they were opponents of the Baha'i Faith. That is not the
case. There were a *lot* of opponents of the Baha'i Faith during its
development, and only certain opponents were described as
fanatical. In this case, the opponents of the Baha'i Faith who held
power in the clergy *were* fanatical by any fair description;
obscurantist, anti-science, superstitious and anti-Western (that is,
in opposition to European enlightenment philosophies, which the noble
class in Persia were well aware of). To be a clergy was no
disqualification from following the Baha'i Faith; indeed, many of the
first followers of the Babi and Baha'i Faiths were themselves
clergymen or serious students of Islam.

The condemnation of fanaticism is not purely in the past tense either;
contemporary Baha'i authorities contine to warn of it. The
urgency is only somewhat dimmed by fanaticism's overtly
backwards-looking nature:

>   The resurgence of fanatical religious fervour occurring in many
>   lands cannot be regarded as more than a dying convulsion. The very
>   nature of the violent and disruptive phenomena associated with it
>   testifies to the spiritual bankruptcy it represents. Indeed, one
>   of the strangest and saddest features of the current outbreak of
>   religious fanaticism is the extent to which, in each case, it is
>   undermining not only the spiritual values which are conducive to
>   the unity of mankind but also those unique moral victories won by
>   the particular religion it purports to serve.

>   (The Universal House of Justice, Messages 1963 to 1986, p. 685)

The main harm it does is to religion itself, unfortunately:

>   Tragically, organized religion, whose very reason for being
>   entails service to the cause of brotherhood and peace, behaves all
>   too frequently as one of the most formidable obstacles in the
>   path; to cite a particular painful fact, it has long lent its
>   credibility to fanaticism. We feel a responsibility, as the
>   governing council of one of the world religions, to urge earnest
>   consideration of the challenge this poses for religious
>   leadership.

>   (The Universal House of Justice, 2002 April, To the World's
>   Religious Leaders, p. 1)

So is fanaticism limited to just terrorists and the oddball relative
whose guns we occasionally have to hide? If it were, it seems unlikely
that it would get this amount of attention by the writings. Perhaps
the writings themselves give a clue to exactly what is meant when
fanaticism is referred to. When we search the Baha'i writings, what
words come up in associated with fanaticism?

* bigotry
* hatred
* strife
* ignorant and blind
* unreasoning
* foolish and mindless
* prejudice

Elsewhere in the writings, fanaticism is associated with superstition
and an overall unscientific attitude. All of the above paints a very
specific picture of a fanatic - namely, the sorts of intolerant,
authoritarian leaders and followers one usually find in extreme
religious causes, cultural movements, and movements of "ethnic
purity". As much as you may dislike the benighted followers of
flat-earth movements and anti-vaxxers, they do not fall into this
category of fanaticism. Instead, one is more likely to find this in
the more extreme wings of well-accepted cultural movements. By its
very nature, when it hides inside accepted institutions, it is hard to
see it as a problem; those who do see it as a problem tend to blame
the movement itself, rather than the fanaticism which damages the
movement.

The question is what to do about it.

--------------------------

I suspect modern psychologists would explain fanaticism as an
unhelathy coping mechanism for something called "cognitive
dissonance." Cognitive dissonance is the discomfort you feel when you
have to reconcile two beliefs that are in seeming opposition to one
another. You, gentle reader, being a psychologically healthy
individual, would react to congnitive
dissonance by re-examining the conflicting beliefs; perhaps you may
discard one belief, judging it to be erroneous, but more likely you'll
modify both so that they come in agreement with one another. In someone 
who is not psychologically healthy, cognitive dissonance is
instead resolved by seeking to eliminate the _source_ of this
dissonance; a nonbelieving relative, scientific authorities, members
of different cultures, unflattering media. Anything that does not
conform to their own cherished beliefs are rejected, ensuring that
cognitive dissonance is never experienced.

But that doesn't fully explain the sort of fanaticism condemned in the
Baha'i writings. Someone could be excessive fearful and credulous by
their very nature. Is fanaticism really blameworthy for such people?
The answer is, it depends upon what one does with one's fanatical
world view. The fanatical behaviors described in the Baha'i are those
that insist on controlling the actions, those close to them,
even to the society as a whole.

>   The fact that we imagine ourselves to be right and everybody else
>   wrong is the greatest of all obstacles in the path towards unity,

>   (Abdu'l-Baha, Paris Talks, p. 135)

>   Fighting, and the employment of force, even for the right cause,
>   will not bring about good results.

>   (Abdu'l-Baha, Abdu'l-Baha in London, p. 91)

>   The unbelievers and the faithless have set their minds on four
>   things: first, the shedding of blood; second, the burning of
>   books; third, the shunning of the followers of other religions;
>   fourth, the extermination of other communities and groups.

>   (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 91)

So there's something going on beyond mere "cognitive dissonance."
Fanatics have taken the extra step of alleviating their discomfort
by forcing others to believe differently, even at the point of violence.

Baha'u'llah's first order of business
what to ensure that _his own believers_ did not themselves become
fanatics. While many of his early writings invoke martyrdom as an
ideal of sacrifice - in keeping with its background in Shi'i Islam
beliefs - such calls are no excuse for descent
into fanaticism and intolerance. While the writings themselves are
replete with calls for fidelity in the faith and sacrifice, such can
never be forced on anyone but oneself.

>    In this Day, We can neither approve the conduct of the fearful
>    that seeketh to dissemble his faith, nor sanction the behavior of
>    the avowed believer that clamorously asserteth his allegiance to
>    this Cause. Both should observe the dictates of wisdom

>    (Baha'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 343)

>    Some heedless souls roam the lands in the name of God, actively
>    engaged in ruining His Cause, and call it promoting and teaching
>    the Word of God...

>    (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 58)

>    The Lord of celestial wisdom saith: A harsh word is even as a
>    sword thrust; a gentle word as milk. The latter leadeth the
>    children of men unto knowledge and conferreth upon them true
>    distinction.

>    (Baha'u'llah, Tabernacle of Unity)

In fact, there are actual laws from the central figure Baha'u'llah
which forbids behaviors and lifestyles that can cultivate fanaticism:
priesthood, monastacism, ascetism, and forcing one's interpretation of
the Holy Writings on others. He also forbade his believers from engaging in
contention and conflict of any sort, let alone about questions of
personal belief.  Likewise, he urged his followers to consort with
followers of all religions, instead of isolating themselves into their
own sub-communities. Other particular laws of note:

* The burning of books is forbidden.
* In sickness, competent physicians shall be consulted with.
* Universal education for all is an obligation for families and
societies, particularly in literacy, conduct and "the
useful arts" (i.e. sciences).
* It upholds the authority of science and "the learned" in matters of
the natural world.

Before closing this topic, I need to clarify that these laws are
written only for the Baha'is themselves. They were not written so that
Baha'is could force this upon other people (much as friends of the
Baha'i Faith may wish they were). Such laws are intended for Baha'is by the founders,
to insist on proper conduct and attitudes from those claiming to
follow the Faith.

-----------------

Baha'is do not, as a rule, involve themselves in political
matters. While some think this is due to a natural quietism and
pacifism, related to perhaps concern of survival, it is more likely a
question of focus. Questions posed as political matters are generally
instead moral or spiritual in nature, and dealing with them through
polical means tend to push it anywhere.

However, in some cases, the "political problem" one thinks of isn't
actually a political problem at all. It's a spiritual problem with
a political symptom, one of many created by the underlying problem.
Religious fanaticism is just such a problem.

Much of the failures of current democracies have been placed at the
hands of demagogues or "populists" or "tribalists" or leaders of various other
right-wing movements. This misses what may very well be a primary
motivation for this - the increasing fanaticism of various movements
that feel they are losing time and sliding into irrelevance.

The Baha'i Faith has little control over religious believers except,
of course, with its own believers. All we can
do is point out the danger, inform others, keep fanaticism out of
our own hearts, and remember to focus our condemnation on fanatical
acts rather than the misguided individuals carrying out these acts.

The contributions to a solution that Baha'is can make outside of their community
are modest, something both supporters and critics must keep in mind.
However, Baha'is are not powerless, and there are a few things
that can be done. Baha's are encouraged to be involved in interfaith
activities. By this activity, it is _not_ meant for the purpose of
converting other believers. Rather, the purpose of such activity
is so that Baha'is understand these other points of view and, hopefully,
to assist those of other religions with our point of view, and see the
dangers of allowing religious fanaticism to damage their own movements.
The Universal House of Justice itself wrote a letter to the world's
relgious leaders, "One Common Faith" in 2002, warning them of the dangers
of fanaticism.

Another contribution Baha'is can do is by refraining from partisanship
and moderating political discussions they become involved in.
There is frequently a strong connection between fanaticism and partisan
political agendas; lowering the temperature in political discussions
usually makes fanatical viewpoints less appealing.

Finally, Baha'is can "teach the Faith." By this, I do not mean
prostelyze or recruit, a mistake made by many Bahai's. I actually mean _teach_.
As in, share with others the Baha'i writings on these issues. Tell
others that the prevention of fanatical beliefs is itself a religious
duty. Warn that those who insist on forcing their own viewpoints on others
are not salutory exemplars of religious zeal, but are instead suffering
from pride and are stunting their own spiritual development. 
Teach that if religion is to be a source of unity, and if religous
rancor become a cause of disunity and strife, it is better that it not
exist. Such
lessons are found in abundance in the Baha'i writings, and the
more we share these with others, the more these lessons
are spread throughout society.
