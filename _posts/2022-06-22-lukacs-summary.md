## On Georg Lukacs' _The Destruction of Reason_

This is a book review of sorts, though not really because I didn't
read the whole book. And trust me, you don't want to either.

The blurb on Georg Lukacs' book  _The Destruction of Reason_ touts it
as a classic. What sort of classit it is? Well,
_The Destruction of Reason_ is a philosophy book, one of a number of
important books written by major thinkers after Germany's defeat in the
second world war that sought to answer the question: just what on earth
where the Germans thinking? Why did they do this? One that took the threat
seriously, and sought to analyze it to prevent it from ever happening
again. Hanna Arendt's _The Origins of Totalitarianism_ and Karl Popper's
_The Open Society and Its Enemies_ are probably the two best known.
These books have seen a resurgence in interest and sales due to the fact
almost everyone who remembers World War II and why we fought in it are
dead and therefore maybe it's a good idea to try facism again maybe the
problem is the Germans just didn't do it right </sarcasm>.

So in 2021
Verso came out with a new publication of this book. It was in the library,
looked compelling, and skimming through the contents it seemed be a serious
work that might have something novel to say, so I checked it out.

What viewpoint was this? Why I'm glad you asked. It's basically an
analysis of totalitarian from a **Marxist** perspective.

I know what you're thinking - talk about the pot calling the kettle black.
In Lukacs' defense, if there is such a thing as a "good communist" perhaps he may
have been one. We can never know; when a Stalin is looking over your shoulder,
it is impossible to keep your hands clean. A Hungarian intellectual, 
not a Russian, he was involved with
the short-lived Hungarian republic after the first world war, and his considerable
reputation is probably why he was briefly the Minister of Culture during the government
of the
brief 1956 Hungarian Revolution. This book was written in 1952, and more
than a few minutes of reading will convince you - it is thoroughly East-bloc
Marxist. There was nothing the censors would've had a problem with, and it consists
almost entirely of polemic. German philosophers come under a considerable
amount of abuse, but so do American and British philosophers, and of course
the term "bourgeois" is thrown around as an insult, just in case you hadn't
figured out the viewpoint.

Why did I read most of it then? Well, mainly because he kept making enough
good points to make it worth continuing. Here, then, are some of them.

1. The main thrust of argumentation follows Marxism's central conceit, which is: the eventual goal of
history is the seizure by The Proletariat of control of productive industries.
In line with Marx's master narrative, the bourgeios (the capital-owners) must engage in constant
subterfuge to keep this from happening. As part of this subterfuge, the bourgeois
class supports philosophies that are opponents of reason and clear
thinking, elevating intuition and fuzzy spiritualism over rational reasoning
and preferring myths and mythologizing over actual documented history. They also support philosophers
whose thoughts cast doubt on democracy and enlightenment values and provide justification for
aristocracies of various sorts.

To this end, Lukacs subjects the philosophies of Schopenhaur and Neitzche to considerable abuse -
Schopenhauer for his pessemism and quitism, and Neitzche for his mythologizing
and the wannabe-aristocracy of his ubermensche. Lukacs also singled
out others that came after Neitzche that set the stage - Sorel, the Marxist-adjacent
founder of fascism is targeted for obvious reasons. However, he also attacks
American pragmatists like James and Dewey and existentialists 
such as Kierkegaard and spiritualists
like Bergson. Most people
reading this probably have a hard time regarding such philosophers as opponents of
reason, but Lukacs was at least salutory in his consistency - any philosopher
whose philosophy could be used to undermine objective truth and reason was
suspect. One imagines the field day Lukacs would have with today's postmodernists.

2. The philosophical tools the Nazis used were popular nineteenth-century
theories that were, in spite of their popularity, known by the educated classes 
to have significant flaws: social darwinism,
racialism and panic about collaps of "western culture." The fact that these are
exactly the same theories behind the 21st-century recrudesence of facism says
something about the characteristics of all of these philosophies, as well facism. Let's
covery these philosophies in turn.

The most central philosophy underlying Naziism, and the one with the weakest support both
philosophically and scientifically, was the theory of race superiority. This theory,
built on a pseudoscientific movement called "racialism," is in fact not ancient.
It dates specifically back to the theories of one Authur de Gobineau of the early
nineteenth century. His invention
of an "Aryan master race" was an outgrowth of his own elitist beliefs. The source
of his beliefs were simplicity itself: he believed that the royal aristocracy of
Europe were, in fact, better than the average folk of Europe, and as such should
enjoy the privileges of aristocracy. The reason they were better, according to
this author, is because they
did not interbreed with outsiders, as would happen with the common classes.

Surprisingly, many of his contemporaries considered his theories ridiculous.
Though one imagines it
apparently had some appeal to disinherited royals, Lukacs indicates de Gobineau complianed
in a letter to deToqueville that his work was being hushed up. (Lukacs did not indicate
whether de Gobineu blamed it on "rampant woke-ism".)  Whether de Gobineu was correct
in his suspicions, his main fan base was not in Europe. It was, unsurprisinly, the
slaveholding class of the southern United States, who eagerly translated his works and
circulated them throughout the States. His peer DeToqueville rightly
pointed out immediately that the only reason such ideas found such fertile ground there was
because it flattered the slave-owning planter class, whose practices obviously went against
both Christian teachings and the enlightenment philosophies the new republic
was based on. Such a thesis horrified the liberal deToqueville, who saw this as
an attack on enlightenment values of equality under the law. This bothered de 
Gobineau not one bit; his central thesis and
conceit was that all men are not equal, they should not be equal under the law,
and there is class of "betters" that
are responsible for civilization and all other races must attend to, Christ's teachings
notwithstanding. Unfortunately, this philosophy, as scientifically flawed as it is,
appears to be perenially popular since it has a built in consituency in
the members of whatever race happens to be defined as "superior."

A newly defined racialism was just one element setting the stage for Naziism,
Darwinism, from a cultural point of
view, may have been the most important scientific discovery of the nineteenth century. Though
Darwin had a scientific modesty about the implication of his findings, this was
not the case of many other intellectuals, particularly Herbert Spencer, who eagerly applied
(or mis-applied) this concept to all of society, posing all humanity in engaging in a struggle
for "survival of the fittest." One does not need to be a Marxist to acknowledge the
popularity this gained among the commercial classes in the West. When
combined with de Gobineau's idea of racial superiority, these two ideas had an immediate corollary:
a war within Western society, wherein the racially pure true inheritors of civilization were compelled by
nature to dominate everyone else, both by their superior nature and their need to defend
the purity of race against the unwashed horde.

But this was not the final building block for Naziism. The final idea required to
build the Third Reich revolved around the ideas of "death of Civilization."
In this case, the source was uniquely German - an intellectual named Oswald Spengler,
whose volume on  _The Decline of the West_, published 1918-1922 had a significant
effect on a defeated Germany. This was not the only work cited by Lukacs, but is
certainly the most significant. The effect was to frame Germany's defeat in World
War I within Germany as a consequence not of its military 
adventurism (the obvious cause in hindsight), but upon
the "cultural decline" of Western civilization. The cause of this so-called decline
was unsurprisingly pinpointed as liberalism, and a militant
dedication to rescue the distinct "Western culture" was the only thing holding
off collapse. Spengler himself was hostile to liberalism
and was an early supporter of fascism. He was an also an antisemite who viewed
Jews as a foreign body in Western culture.

All three of these ideas, when spread throughout the intellectual class, made
fertile ground for the rise of Naziism. All three of these ideas are, roughly
speaking, present in the in today's neofacism. And finally, all three of these
ideas are philosophically unsound and wilt under reasoning and open investigation.
Why didn't the German intellectual classes sound the alarm on the irrationality
of these theses, in some
cases instead embrace them wholeheartedly? This leads back to
Lukac's central villans. Neitzche's embrace of myth and open
disregard for liberalism laid the groundwork for rejection of enlightenment
values; Schopenhaur's pessimism, quietism and individualism was needed
to get people to consent to acceptance. All three of these ideas, however 
irrational, tend to be self-flattering
to both intellectual classes and the less educated, who take their cues from
them. The natural instinct to rebel against the irrationalism endemic in
such thoughts is too easily supressed if one's thoughts are based on passive
detachment, individualism and an unwillingless to defend enlightenment values.

3. Jewish readers may believe antisemetism is central to the story. While it
is central to the Nazi mythos, according
to Lukacs it's just an obvious corrolary to the race theory.
"Jewish" is associated with both race and
religion, and for the proponents of racialism, both of these posed an enormous
problems.

First, the semetic forbears of the Jewish race meant that the Jews
themselves were a source of miscygenation. Defenders of racialism are
pathetically obsessed with "race purity." Their claim is that race purity
is necessary to defend civilization, which is the sole purview of The White.
In reality, miscygenation is the most obviousy way race theory falls flat
on its face. Race theory has no actual biological standard - even in the
eighteenth century, science could not provide a compelling 

However, just as more problematic was the Jewish religion themselves, which 
racialists correctly diagnosed as
the source of the Christian enlightnement beliefs they did not like. One could
always invent pseudosciences to back up racialism; the fact that the science behind
it was nonsense was easy to overlook for many observers eager to have a science
tell them what they didn't want to believe. But if one believed Christianity
was an important part of white cluture, then one had the extreme problem. Christianity
itself forbade any nonsense talk of racial aristocracies. It is far easier to
find passages in Christianity which proclaim "equality under God" than it
is to find support for an aristocracy built upon racial purity. Rather than
attempt to fix this by tenditious reinterpretations, like America's Southern
planters' aristocracy, the solution wasn to exclaim that Christianity had 
been "contaminated" by Judaism. Jesus was actually white, the True Religion
he preached was only for whites, and much of his doctrine was scurrilous
inventions of the Jews. With this line of thinking established, it was obvious
why it was necessary for the Nazis to invent a true "Aryan" religion.

There are important parallels to this line of thinking and contemporary
American racialists. In particular, the bulk of racialists strongly identify
themselves as being "culturally Christian" but do not in fact go to church.
It has been found that among the most culturally conservative Christians,
church attendance is highly _negatively_ correlated with racialist beliefs.
Indeed, many of the "intellectuals" who defend racialism have proposed
abandoning Christianity and perhaps embracing more ancient European
religions.

4. The philosophies pilloried by Lukacs are always presented as merely
exposing The Truth, sometimes even in a regretful manner. If the continental
deconstructionists had a point, it's that no philosophy is written from
a "neutral" point of view. All of these philosophies, stated or not, defend
some sort of agenda. Particularly for those that contributed most directly
to facist regimes, these were viewpoints in search of a logical argument, not the
other way around. At least de Gobineau had the honesty to be clear about his
viewpoint; in his core, he did not believe all human beings were equal in
his core, happily proclaimed himself as a better class of being, and admitted
that his racialist works were aimed at proving to others the rightness of
his viewpoint. Others were less honest, or at least less forthright, but none
can overlook the fact these were philosophies that benefitted some at the
expense of others - and conveniently, benefitted the conservative classes
of Germany after the first war most of all.

Ergo, the antisemetism as the core foundation of Naziism. As Hitler himself
admitted, had the Jews not been around, it would have been necessary to invent
them. In the Jewish people, you had something you could claim as a distinct
race, whose beliefs undermined antiliberal beliefs and therefore were anathema,
and whose presence was overrepresented in both within the liberal causes they disdained
and within the commercial classes resented by the lower class for their success
and the upper class for their competition. In such a case, it is inevitable
that philosophies seeking to justify their vilification of the Jews would
have suddenly received so many receptive ears.

5. In the end, these philosophical blame does not belong to the
_hoi polloi_, who seem so credulous as to believe all manner of conspiracy
theories and have no compunction staffing the engines of death required by
totalitarian societies. Where irrationality is accepted, it is surely because the less
intellectual take
their cues from those educated people they respect, who have also embraced
irrationality. Lukacs puts it very bluntly:

> We will often be asked in amazement how it was that large masses of the
> German people could trustingly accept the puerile myth propounded by Hitler
> and Rosenberg. We may best counter with the historical question: how could 
> the best-educated and intellectually most eminent men in German beileve
> in Schopenhauer's mythical 'will', the pronouncements of Neitzches'
> Zarathustra, or the history-myths of the decline of the West? And it is
> not good enough to say that the intellectual and artistic level of Schopenhauer
> and Nietzche is immeasurably higher than the course and contradictory
> demagogy of Hitler and Rosenburg. For if a person educated in philosophy
> and literature is able to follow epistemologically the nuances of Nietzsche's
> reworking of Schopenhauer, and to appreciate with aesthetic and psychological
> sensitivity the nuances of his critique of decadence, yet still believes in the
> Zarathustra myth, the myth of the Superman and 'eternal recurrence', this
> is at bottom harder to fanthom than the despairing belief of a poorly educated
> working youth - someone who was never or only temporarily a member of
> a party and was left out in the cold after finishing his apprenticeship - that
> Hitler would realize 'German socialism.' (p.88)

But why now then? About this, our Marxist writer and my Baha'i friends have
the same takeaway lesson:

> The factor common to such ages of social folly, of superstition and a
> faith in miracles taken to extremes, is that they were always periods of the
> decline of an old social order and a culture implanted for centuries, and at
> the same time epochs of fresh birth pangs. (p.89)

-----------------------------------

These are some of the key takeaways. That is not to say the book is without
its flaws - it has plenty. Reading Enzo Traverso's forward leaves one with
the feeling "ok, why am I reading this?" In particular, Lukacs paints a picture
of German philosophy in the nineteenth century as consisting entirely of
irrationalist nonsense, completely overlooking other post-Kantian Germans
that don't fit into his framework.

Another problem is basically a flaw in Marxism itself
(I know, you're thinking "there was only one?"). Marxism is a bit like
the "psychohistory" of the _Foundation_ series for you sci-fi fans: a history
used for prognostication which claims to be based on science whose underling presumption
is that the masses of people are passive entities reacting to forces with
no agency whatsoever. So it is with the choice of philosophy by the bourgeois;
they pick irrationalist philosophies because they are impelled to do so, and
any exceptions are not worth discussing.

In fact, many philosophies and irrationalizations exist not because of of
impersonal forces, but for the opposite reason - because people are moral actors
with their own tendency toward irrationalities. There will be those that study
or follow a philosophy due to a need to discover answers for themselves. And there
will be those that study philosophy with an eye toward justifying actions they
wish to take, favoring those that propound a world view that puts themselves
and people like themselves at the top. Invocation of class-consciousness is
not necessary. Some people are dedicated jerks, and those that feel the need
to rationalize their actions have a broad array of philosophies to choose from.
Look at the number of Americans that eagerly evangelize the philosophy of
Ayn Rand; in spite of the fact that not even libertarian philosophers 
take her seriously, she continues to be popular because some rich people who want
to become aristocrats and some ordinary people
who want to be rich like the results of her messages.

So Lukacs' book cannot be a final answer.
But for analysis of the forces and philosophies supporting facism, it's a
valuable analysis. One not believe in Marx' class theories to undersand this
analysis, or to recognize the self-serving philosophies that give rise
to facism.
