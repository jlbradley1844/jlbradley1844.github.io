### Abstract

The concept of spirituality is an important one to Baha'is. Indeed,
Abdu'l-Baha says that our knowledge of the spiritual must catch up with
our knowledge of the material. Yet there is no single definition of
what "spiritual" means, and in common conversation it has become a term
so vague as to be meaningless for serious discussions. This paper aims
to distinguish between several different meaning of "spiritual," first
covering popular conceptions in both "Western" religions and philosophy,
and then covering what is meant by "Spiritual" in the Baha'i writings.
The goal is to bring precision and meaning to conversations about
spirituality, as well as show that the Baha'i concept of spirituality
is more precise and is best suited toward serious study.

## Spirituality: An Introduction

Spiritual: An empty but uplifting term often found in personals ads.

This, or something like that, was a definition given by a Charles Bufe in
his _American Heritics Dictionary_, a humor paperback that has long since left
my possesion. But the definition has stuck with me, for good reasons.
The term "spirituality" has become a weasel word in society - a vague term
meant to imply upliftment without saying anything meaningful. The dictionary
definition contains many alternate meanings, and a glance through any encyclopedic
reference such as Wikipedia will reveal an unthinkably broad term.

One dictionary definition frames it thusly:

    spiritual: "of the spirit"; usually, of or relating 
    to an invisible world.

While technically correct, this rather poorly conveys the concept. We can't
"see" gravitational fields; are they spiritual? Obviously not. There are also
a number of other definitions for spiritual, including, simply things of a
religious nature.

This is problematic when understanding The Baha'i Faith, since the concept
of "the spiritual" is centrally important in the Baha'i writings. Perhaps
rather than rely upon dictionary definitions, we should allow the Baha'i writings
to define it. If we are to build a spiritual civilization, it would help to
know what it is, rather than just assuming people know what spiritual is - especially
when everyone have different ideas about spirituality due to their upbringing
and life experiences.

In fact, this gap has actually been called out in religious literature as a
void of study. There could be a few reasons for this. One is because
every religion or sect seems to have its own definition of spirituality. Indeed, it has been
argued by some that spirituality is a "Western" concept forced on other religions -
in spite of the fact the followers of those other religions themselves have no
problem whatsoever describing their spirituality! Baha'i readers will not be surprised
by this universality, but those wishing for a consistent, universal picture of spirituality
will have to contend with the same personal, vague definitions. Meanwhile, those
that sit outside of religious traditions are generally no help clarifying the situation;
atheists are happy to portray the spiritual impulse as
a function of a limbic system placed there by
evolution, while divinity-school academics regard spirituality as a sort
of emic categorization of personal religious feelings by believers.

Fortunately, we need not rely upon such definitions.
We can study specific uses of the the term
"spiritual" in the Baha'i Faith to make this term more meaningful. This will allow 
spiritual language to be defined in a more precise way, allowing us to better 
understand the writings, allow correct usage in discussions around the Faith,
prevent its misuse, and defend the concept against materialists,
who may simply wish to recast spiritual things as relics of unscientific
conceptions of reality.

## Spirituality - A Categorization

Before examining the Baha'i writings, it is helpful to contrast how "spiritualty"
is regarded in other religions, as well as in popular culture.
Contemporary thought views "spirituality" as entirely religious in
nature, referring entirely to non-emperical phenomenon, to be upheld entirely
by personal belief and faith only.
Material concerns are thought of as the domain entirely of science. 

However, actual usage in religion and philosophy shows the concept of spirituality
to be a very broad one. Indeed, "spirituality" seems to be a blanket terminology
for several distinct but related phenomenon. This section will
examine various conceptualizations from both religious and materialist
viewpoints. An examination shows that one reason spirituality is so hard to
pin down is it is used for many distinct things, related only by a religious context.

### Spirituality as Mystical Experience

One of the most powerful religious traditions is that which thinks of
spirituality in a personal nature. Spirituality is felt by individuals
wishing to bring themselves into God's presence - an altered state of
being where one may "meet God".

Islamic mysticism, which developed during the "golden age" of Islam in the tenth
through twelfth century, more fully developed the sense of "The Spiritual" in Islam.
Many of Baha'u'llah's mystic works presume knowledge of some of these great figures,
including such works as "The Seven Valleys," "The Four Valleys" and "The Tablet of
All Food." This mysticism, as practiced by many Sufi orders, was aimed at developing
spiritual behaviors in an attempt to achieve "union with God."

There is also a powerful element of the mystical in Christianity.
As in Islam, Christianity also has an extensive history of mysticism, and the hagiography
of its saints is filled with the names of mystics who sought the paths to their union with God.
Just as Sufi orders detached from the world in their quest, many Christian mystics found
their path in ascetism and withdrawl from the world. In all such orders, "spiritualty" is not
only something that is felt, in one's heart during prayer; it is a life one leads. Interestingly,
when perusing works on such saints, the impression one gets is their main activity is
"being spiritual." 
The lives of the numerous mystics in both the Islamic and Christian traditions attest
to the fact that spirituality can be an experience as much as it is a thing.

One of the earliest serious works of psychology is William James' work, _The Varieties
of Religious Experience_. This work is over a century old, and is by no means authoritative.
But the picture James' draws of a universal relgious experience still remains compelling. In his
telling, all religions are unified by the ability to draw out in their believers
particular experiences of the spiritual that are alike across all cultures, both in
their ability to uplift and their sometimes betwildering manifestations. This isn't 
his sole concern; there are vivid examples showing
the pitfalls of blind faith borne of
religious devotion. By his telling, the heart of
any religious creed is this ability to induce altered spiritual states of being
in their believers, and he provides some very good examples of what the concept of
spirituality means for many.

### Spirituality as an Unseen World

Somewhat related to this is to regard spiritualty as referencing an unseen
world. To many, this is where many of the things felt as "relgious" exist: God, Angels,
the souls of the Dead, and other sort of supernatural entities.
Followers of the all major world religions, with perhaps the arguable exception of Buddhism,
claim some sort of belief in this spirit world.
This formulation is so commonplace that it is felt to be identical to relgious belief.

By the time of Jesus Christ, Jewish mystics were known to believe in the spirit world,
as did certain strains of Greek philosophy. Early Christian beliefs fit into this
matrix very well. Much of this was tacit, and The Bible does not seem to reference
this explicitly. Yet it is obvious that Christianity as practiced today regards
belief in such nonmaterial concepts as Heaven and Angels as unseen spiritual realities,
and as God as residing in this plane.

The views of The Bab and Baha'u'llah come from the matrix of the Islamic world,
and for that reason, it is important to consider the nature of spiriuality in
Islam. One view of spirituality in Islam is that of an "unseen world" - a world outside of
our own that is immaterial yet somehow interacts with us. And "the unseen" (al-ghayb,
or al-ghiab) is directly referenced in the Koran. This is regarded by Muslims as a
fundamental pillar of belief.

The unseen world is Islam is described as
something directly known only by God Himself. Besides being the plane of God
Himself, this unseen world is populated by beings.
There are three entities: angels, which are immortal and purely
good, devils, which are immortal and strictly evil, and djinn, which are similar
to humans in that they are mortal and may be good or evil.
The Islamic concept of "the unseen" is not limited to such worlds, but includes
other things such as prophecied future events like The Final Judgement and The
Resurrection. As such, it's careful to note that when a Muslim talks about "the
unseen," it does not mean this person beliefs this is something that will not
manifest itself physically. As for Baha'i beliefs, it is clear that any of these
are interpreted as being spiritual; much of this is elaborated in Baha'u'llah's
_Book of Certitude_.

One need not believe in a specific creed to have strong beliefs in this sort of world.
Many people who claim to be religious actually have these sorts of beliefs.
When someone claims they are "Spiritual but not religious," the accepted interpretation
by others is that this is a person who does have religious beliefs, but
has either not formalized a creed or does not accept those of any of
the religions they know about. This label, while applying to some agnostics skeptical of
any spiritual world, also includes those with deep beliefs in the spiritual world,
complete with beliefs in heavily
populated other worlds. (Indeed, religious surveys that require people to choose an
actual creed sometimes make the mistake of failing to allow for this category, causing
the ranks of the unreligious to seem much larger than it actually is.)

#### Distinction of Spiritual Sphere from the Miraculous

Belief in a spiritual sphere of influence is thought to be belief identical to
belief in "magic" by materialistic critics. However, most religious believers 
make a strong distinction between "spiritual"
and "magic". "Spiritual" is an indication of religious forces of an
inner life, in which the relation to the material world is murky and tenuous.
"Magic" on the other hand, indicates unexplained powers in the physical world.

More intellectual religious traditions have taken great pains to distinguish
such things as Jesus' reported miracles from mere operation of magical supernatural
forces and regard most claims of
miraculous "works of the spirit" as nonsense. Saint Thomas Aquainas' view was the
common one held
by theologians: claims of miraculous and magical acts should be subject to skepticism
because the laws of nature
are in fact God's own laws, and because God is logical, He will not break his laws
arbitrarily.
Indeed, in more liberal Christian denominations, many of the believers
doubt Jesus ever performed the
miracles ascribed to them. In essence, there is a distinction between belief
in spirituality, which is seen as outside science, and miracles and magic, which is seen as
an unlikely occurrence of God breaking His own laws.
However, less intellectually-based sects and "new age" movements make no such
distinction; this viewpoint will be discussed later.

### Spirituality as Faith

Not all usages of spirituality posit an invisible unseen world or altered
states of consciousness.
Another view of spirituality is as a sort of Faith - e.g. a belief in
a claim without proof.

Christianity and many strands of Islam use this meaning frequently. Indeed, fideism, the
belief that relying on faith alone rather than on reason is the essence of religion,
is very strong in many Christian sects, and is see as the essence of spirituality.
This is possibly seen most strongly in their belief in prophecy and unshaking faith
in the end times.
This is not just the provenance of peculiar sects in Christianity; where spirituality
is referred to in the New Testament, often it is with respect to the spirit of
Faith seen as important in every Christian believer.

This has an analog in Islam. For some, elements of "the Unseen" such as the
Resurrection of the Dead and The Day of Judgement is said to be to be unseen
because it is knowledge of a future event. Louay Fatoohi in www.quranicstudies.com
notes that in many cases, "ghayb" is more correctly translated as "matter of
faith. Still, these are considered matters of faith because they are unseen,
and the unseen extends to articles of faith such as belief in the prophets,
belief in divine books, and belief in predestination.
Such religious faith is seen as spiritual due to the belief it cultivates
in believers.

For some fideistic believers, this belief can sometimes overlap with beliefs
of a materialist nature, producing a picture of a spiritual world that
is quasi-material. In such cases, there is no clear demarcation between
a spiritual world and a physical world; indeed, the spirit world _is_ the physical world,
and those with enough faith can see the signs of the spiritual in the physical world.
This writer has met individuals with this belief, who insist that the 
skeptical have simply not been able to benefit from the spirit world
powers due to their lack of faith.

### Spirituality as a Religious Stat#e

Overlapping with spirituality as a mystical state is the conception of
spirituality as being the state of who has turned one's
belief wholly to a religious cause. For example, this is frequently seen in early Christian
writings. In many cases, when the world "spiritual"
is used, one could interchange with the word "religious" or "Christian" without losing
sense of the meaning of the sentence. For instance, the message of Jesus is described
as a "spiritual gift" (Romans 1:11); the goal of the teachings is to bring "wisdom and
spiritual understanding" (Collosians 1:10). But there are inklings of the use of "spiritual"
in a more particular manner; for instance in Corinthians, where spirituality is extensively
discussed:

> All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, 
> another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. There are 
> also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, 
> and the glory of the terrestrial is another.
> There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the 
> stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection 
> of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: It is sown in 
> dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: 
> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, 
> and there is a spiritual body. 

> And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was 
> made a quickening spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which 
> is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, 
> earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also 
> that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
>                                        (1 Corinthians 15:39-48)

In such a view, "spirituality" is just a description of someone rightly believing
in a cause, which is very similar to the faith-based description above.

### Materialist Views

Philisophical physicalists, known in the Baha'i writings as "materialists," are
those that believe the entirety of reality can be studied emperically and may
be explained entirely through study of the laws of nature. While they are happy
to believe in mysterious, unseen forces - witness the oddball nature of quantum mechanics
itself - they draw a sharp distinction between such forces which are amenable to
reproduction under experimentation and modeling by powerful mathematics, and those 
postulated by the traditions of theology, which are regarded with suspicion, no
matter how well-reasoned. As such, materialists typically 
handle talk of the "spiritual" by dismissing it entirely. Those who wish to keep
the scientific pursuit while acknowledging the spiritual may hedge this by thinking
of the spiritual and material as two different "magesteria"; e.g. the study of
material or measurable things is the purview of science only, and anything spiritual
is the purview of the religious. While this hearkens back to the old Cartesian dualism,
this probably owes more to Kant's distinction between things can be known scientifically
and and mental realities not amenable to such study.

Still, the underlying worldview of most materialists is that "spiritual" refers to a make-believe
magical world, and spirituality is thought of as being little distinguished from
magical thinking. The "just-so story" told by such materialists to explain the prevelance
of religious beliefs is that religion was
an invention by primitive people used to explain natural phenomenon. As
the scientific revolution explained more of this phenomenon, spiritual explanations
lost salience, and spirituality is now no longer a valid concept. This argument fails due
to the obvious fact that almost all religous belief has nothing to do with attempts to model 
physical reality. However, this has not prevented materialists from presenting this explanation
repeatedly to each other in their discussions of religion.
To such materialists then, "spirituality" is hogwash; a cover for incoherent beliefs
that does nothing but signify the believer as holding beliefs in non-existent invisible,
untestable phenomenon.

Ironically, this materialistic definition of spirituality may be the one must used
in populat culture - an "invisible world" resistant to scientific inquiry and skeptical
questioning. This view is sometimes adopted by religious people in spite of its deep
compatibility with skeptical materialist worldviews.

#### Religious Materialists

There are also religious beliefs that agree with materialistic views -  that is, there
is no spiritual world as such, but "spiritual powers" are in fact powers in the
material world, and religious beliefs must be interpreted as such. Heaven and Hell
are real places and Angels are unseen entities that carry out tasks in the material
world. Naturally, for such people, "spirituality" does in fact become a synomym
for magic. This viewpoint is found in many religious sects and in certain "new age"
movements.

This is an archaic, primitive worldview but it is historically important.
If one reads the books of Genesis, the ancient myths of the Greeks, and various myths of
other cultures, there is little appeal to abstraction or invisible worlds. The Gods
were real physical beings, who did things in the physical world. While by the time of the
late antiquity there were philosophers and prophets posing the existence of
unseen spiritual worlds, an idea taken for granted in contemporary religious beliefs,
going back into mythic history one will look for vain for
myths propounding a spiritual world parallel to this one yet free from it.

Such "materialist believers" have extrapolated this primitive world 
view to the religions of today. For many sects inside Christianity and Islam,
concepts such as heaven, hell, "resurrection of the dead," 
and "the Day of Judgement" are said to all exist not in some "spiritual world" but
in the physical world. For example, Jehovah Witnesses' literature insists that Jesus'
second coming and creation of a "new world" will happen on this Earth, complete with an
actual resurrection of the dead. This "religious
materialism" is frequently a sign of fundamentalism; see, for
example, Vahid Ranjabar's talk on "materialistic spirituality";<https://youtu.be/R98AnJ3hDFg>. 
In this case, the religions themselves chose to interpret entities
intended to be spiritual and non-material as having material realities, in
many cases due to a misguided fanatical mindset.
In the worst case, such beliefs interpret claims of believers' spiritually elect
station as meaning that they have the right to overtake governments and oppress and dominate
other religious groups and nonbelievers in the here and now.

One last viewpoint, which is interesting primarily due to its rarity, is that
of the "scientific religious materialist"; someone
who believes actual religious events and phenomenon such as immortality are real but 
can be explained with scienific process. Probably the only notable example of this 
is Frank J. Tipler's Omega Point Theory, which posits a physical process explaining 
resurrection and immortality.

#### Commercial Interests

Where one finds a materialist worldview, one will find commercial interests willing
to make a buck selling people things. As one would expect, commercial interests have propounded
their own definition of "spiritual," one that is used to validate the consumption of
goods sold to aide a "spiritual lifestyle." It's easy to ridicule businesses that
make money selling "healing crystals" and other spiritual-sounding new age nick-nacks, 
but relative to an individual's expenditures, this amounts
pocket change (besides, the gentle reader might actually need a prayer mat). Rather,
the greater amount of money is made on selling experiences marketed as distinctly 
"spiritual" - retreats, workshops, foreign
vacations, a host of experiences marketed as uplifting self-improvement,
disguising the fact that these are more or less entertainments and diversions, completely
unrelated to character development. Under this commercial worldview,
"spiritual" becomes a positively-viewed word associated with any low-stress indulgence that 
does not involve the consumption of calories.
While few believers give "sprituality" this sort of meaning,
when discussing spirituality, it is worth keeping in mind that due to such commercial
enterprise, the word "spiritual" now conveys to the more skeptically-minded
a notion of indolence and self-involement.

## Baha'i Views on Spirituality

With this background complete, we are now able to examine what "spirituality"
may mean within the Baha'i Faith. 

A study of spirituality, as defined in the Baha'i Faith, makes very clear that
far from being the purview of personal beliefs and "wooooo" (as materialists
might put it), spiritual things are items of significance to society that 
have a "shared reality" (that is, are not entirely personal) and can
and should be studied. To understand that fact though, it is necessary to
understand what spirituality refers to in the Baha'i writings themselves.

This analysis has two approaches:

1. Analysis of those writings which explicitly discuss spirituality and
other spiritual worlds.

2. Analysis of the use of the term "spiritual" by central figures of
the Faith, primarily Abdu'l-Baha.
 
### Baha'i Cosmology and Spirituality

The Baha'i Faith give no definition of what is meant by "the spiritual" or
similar analysis. There is no "periodic table" of spiritual elements that
could be used to study spirituality in a cartesian fashion.
There is, however, a discussion of the "spiritual worlds" in existence.
This is in Baha'u'llah's untranslated tablet, "The Tablet of All Food."

The tablet is short, but the analysis is extremely complex, and many Baha'i
scholars have written articles analyzing the various planes. However, the
primary takeaways which is identified by all scholars is easy to
understand and will suffice for the scope of this paper.

That lesson is: humans exist in both the physical world and a spiritual world.
Ths spiritual plane in which humans reside is the lowest spiritual 
plane in God's creation, and the
only one we may reside in. As for our experience in the physical realm, it
is "metaphoric." It is a physical world in which we develop ourselves spiritually.
Regrettably, your dog Spot is entirely
physical, and will cease to exist upon his death (*sad noises*).

Baha'i writings describing such a parallel spiritual universe are otherwise
circumscribed. However, the writings are very clear to distinguish entities
that reside on the spiritual plane, and distinguish them from materialistic
concerns. For example, take the concept of "Angels." This is a hypothesized
entity of pure spirit present
in Christianity and Islam (and even in non-Abrahamic religions such as Hinduism).
Christians, Muslims and other religious believers posit 
that angels are spiritual agents that carry out actions in the physical
world. The Baha'i writings dramatically reconceptualize this concept:

> The meaning of 'angels' is the confirmations of God and His celestial powers. 
> Likewise angels are blessed beings who have severed all ties with this nether 
> world, have been released from the chains of self and the desires of the flesh, 
> and anchored their hearts to the heavenly realms of the Lord. These are of the 
> Kingdom, heavenly; these are of God, spiritual; these are revealers of God's 
> abounding grace; these are dawning-points of His spiritual bestowals.
>           (Abdu'l-Baha, Selections from the Writings of Abdu'l-Baha, p. 81)

So when Baha'u'llah refers to angels in his writings, such as this:

> Verily, We behold you from Our realm of glory, and shall aid whosoever will 
> arise for the triumph of Our Cause with the hosts of the Concourse on 
> high and a company of Our favored angels.
>      (Baha'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 139)

it is very likely he is talking in the terms stated by Abdu'l-Baha - either
a power of God working through saintly humans, who actually carry out
his work.
In Baha'i framing, an Angel is indeed a spiritual entity - but an entity
indistinguishable from an actual human acting on the spiritual plane.

In the Baha'i writings, the spiritual plane is invisible and lies parallel
to the material plane - but the primary interface between the two are through
His Messengers and believers carrying out spiritual acts. In practice, this means that
Baha'i writings eschew talk of the miraculous in the material world.
Baha'i writings,
while not outright denying the possiblity of such occurrences, lay no emphasis
on reports of miracles. This is addressed at length in _Some Answered Questions_.
Look, for example, at Abdu'l-Baha'is definition of a miracle:

> But in the day of the Manifestation the people with insight see that all 
> the conditions of the Manifestation are miracles, for They are superior to 
> all others, and this alone is an absolute miracle. Recollect that Christ, 
> solitary and alone, without a helper or protector, without armies and 
> legions, and under the greatest oppression, uplifted the standard of God 
> before all the people of the world, and withstood them, and finally conquered 
> all, although outwardly He was crucified. Now this is a veritable miracle 
> which can never be denied. There is no need of any other proof of the truth of Christ.
> The outward miracles have no importance for the people of Reality.
>                   (Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 101)

So the Baha'i writings define spirituality as existing on its own plane - but
a plane in which human's spirit reside, unfettered by material concerns. When the
spiritual enters the material world, it is through human actions. This is not to
take away from the idea of the transcendent in the natural world, but it does mean
that the primary means where spiritual forces enter the laws of nature is through
the actions of humans, not mystical forces we cannot understand.

### The Definitions of "Spiritual" in the Baha'i Writings

The "Tablet of All Food" is unique in that it is one of the few places in which
Baha'u'llah gives an description of the spiritual world, rather than simply alluding
to it in metaphors. (This distinction is probably why it is easy to find provisional
translations of this tablet.) Otherwise, Baha'u'llah tended to refer to spiritual
concepts through phrases using particular things, for instance, by using
"The Pen of Glory" and "The Maid of Heaven" as referring to His revelation, using
"The Concourse on High" to refer to the departed believers, and so on. On the other
hand, there are very few usages of the term "spiritual" in his translated writings.
In his use of metaphors, His writings were actually more precise, as the same metaphor
was used to mean the same thing throughout his corpus. However, as far as enlightening
us to a Baha'i view of "spiritual," it is not as helpful.

The translated writings of Abdu'l-Baha, on the other hand, use the word "spiritual"
quite a lot. As such, his writings are particularly helpful in painting a picture of
what spirituality means in the Baha'i writings.
In the main, Abdu'l-Baha's translated corpus uses spiritual as an adjective, and in
connection with things. The meaning of "spiritual" changes based on the particular
noun that it modifies. By analyzing these word associations, it is possible to form
a Baha'i view of "the spiritual." This is the bulk of this paper's analysis.
As one would expect, it validates many of the common
usages while ruling out many others.

These are many "things" that are said to be spiritual. Unfortunately, those "things" 
can sometimes be just as abstract as the term spirituality! To truly understand, it
is necessary to examine actual usage - to abstract away the meaning from the particulars
of use.

A study of the Baha'i writings seem to ratify two of the definitions of
"spirituality" from the survey of other religious beliefs. In the Baha'i writings, "spirituality"
refers to one of two things:

1. Spirituality in the cosmological state; that is, in use when describing an
actual "spiritual" plane of existence alongside the material world. While many Baha'i
writings refer to this meaning, it is _not_ what "spirituality" is generally used to mean.

2. Spirituality in the religious sense: this refers to behaviors in conformance with
mankind's immaterial, "spiritual" nature. In a sense, "spiritual" is used as an
adjective meaning "as in the spiritual world."

This is a significant distinction for the purposes of communication. The first definition
is meaningless to whose who do not believe in an immaterial or unseeable world. However,
the second definition describes things that are visible in the world and well understood
even by those who claim to be unbelievers.

The remaining section is an analysis of the usage of the term "spiritual" in the writings,
and analyze their usage based on the above two categories. The purpose is to flesh out
the two definitions and show what terms such as "spiritual" and "spirituality" actually
mean in the context of the writings.

#### Usage of the "Cosmological" Definition of "Spirituality"

* "spiritual life" - A comment on the spiritual part of the life of a man or woman. The
  passages describing the spiritual life sometimes approach a dualist description of
  our very natures, even though Baha'i philosophy cannot be described as dualist;

>   When we were in the mineral kingdom, although we were endowed with certain gifts 
>   and powers, they were not to be compared with the blessings of the human kingdom. 
>   In the matrix of the mother we were the recipients of endowments and blessings 
>   of God, yet these were as nothing compared to the powers and graces bestowed 
>   upon us after birth into this human world. Likewise, if we are born from the 
>   matrix of this physical and phenomenal environment into the freedom and loftiness 
>   of the spiritual life and vision, we shall consider this mortal existence and 
>   its blessings as worthless by comparison.

>   In the spiritual world the divine bestowals are infinite, for in that realm 
    there is neither separation nor disintegration, which characterize the 
>   world of material existence. Spiritual existence is absolute immortality, 
>   completeness and unchangeable being. Therefore, we must thank God that He 
>   has created for us both material blessings and spiritual bestowals. He has 
>   given us material gifts and spiritual graces, outer sight to view the lights 
>   of the sun and inner vision by which we may perceive the glory of God. He 
>   has designed the outer ear to enjoy the melodies of sound and the inner 
>   hearing wherewith we may hear the voice of our Creator. We must strive with 
>   energies of heart, soul and mind to develop and manifest the perfections 
>   and virtues latent within the realities of the phenomenal world, for the 
>   human reality may be compared to a seed. If we sow the seed, a mighty tree 
>   appears from it. The virtues of the seed are revealed in the tree; it puts 
>   forth branches, leaves, blossoms, and produces fruits. All these virtues 
>   were hidden and potential in the seed. Through the blessing and bounty of 
>   cultivation these virtues became apparent. Similarly, the merciful God, our 
>   Creator, has deposited within human realities certain latent and potential 
>   virtues. Through education and culture these virtues deposited by the loving 
>   God will become apparent in the human reality, even as the unfoldment of the 
>   tree from within the germinating seed. I will pray for you.
>         (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 90)

  Other writings elaborate upon this:

>   [Regarding] this verse in Corinthians, "As in Adam all die, even so in 
>   Christ shall all be made alive," means, according to this terminology, that 
>   Adam is the father of man -- that is to say, He is the cause of the physical 
>   life of mankind; His was the physical fatherhood. He is a living soul, but 
>   He is not the giver of spiritual life, whereas Christ is the cause of the 
>   spiritual life of man, and with regard to the spirit, His was the spiritual 
>   fatherhood. Adam is a living soul; Christ is a quickening spirit.

* "spiritual world" - In this phrase, the Baha'i writings dwell upon the spiritual
  plane as a plane beyond existence, as in the mystical traditions.

>     (Provisional Translations, 'Abdu'l-Baha - Tablet of the Universe (provisional translation, p. 2)
>     (The original Tablet can be found in Makatib-i 'Abdu'l-Bahá, vol. 1, pp 13-32.)`

  The above provisional translation should be taken as provisional, but those
  readers familiar with neoplatonism as a philosophy will regonize that
  the terms Abdu'l-Baha used (particulars and universals) have strong parallels
  with this philosophy, making this description of the spiritual world far
  more concrete than in many other passages.

  As if the idea of an alternate spiritual world needs an affirmation, Shoghi
  Effendi notes that this has a very particular name in Baha'i writings:

>   ABHA KINGDOM  -- - {The Most Glorious Kingdom:} the spiritual world beyond this world.
>       (Shoghi Effendi, This Decisive Hour, p. 148)

  And occasionally, Baha'i writings characterize particular characteristics of
  the spiritual world. This particular excerpt list one fact, in a typically
  apophatic manner (that is, it describes what it is _not_), as in this indication
  of gender non-existence:

>   We must also remember that sex is a characteristic of this world, not 
>   of the spiritual world.
>      (The Universal House of Justice, 1992 Feb 23, Ancient Goddess Religions)

#### Usage of the "Practical" Definition of "Spirituality"

In the above "cosmological" usages of spirituality, the term "spiritual" is
almost used as a place modifier; e.g. it describes something that is not of
this world, but of a completely separate plane of existence.

However, in most usages of "spiritual" in the Baha'i writings it is used as
as if in an analogy; e.g. to describe a noun which has features of the spiritual
world. While the spiritual world itself is not evident, most usages of the term
spiritual describe things that are signs of the spirit world in the material world
itself.

We can see this dualism when we look at the use of the phrase "spiritual things."
This designation is used in a variety of contexts, and
depending on the context, it may mean different things. For instance:

  * It may refer to philisophical entities, generally in a neoplatonic vein; 
    e.g., "For physical things are signs and imprints of spiritual things; every 
    lower thing is an image and counterpart of a higher thing." -- Abdu'l-Baha
      (Provisional Translations, Tablet of the Universe)

On the other hand:

  * It may refer to items which are matters of conscience or religious behavior.
Plainly the latter may easily be seen and studied in the material world, even by
the most materialistic of observers.

The remaining phrases commonly identified in the Baha'i writings fit strongly
into this practical definition.

* "spiritual virtues and divine qualities" - This is used to discribe virtues. 
   Virtues as commonly identified
   as matters of spiritual education, as opposed to material. This is often contrasted
   with "material education," that is, education in science and practical matters. 
   Abdu'l-Baha notes that the spiritual birthright is innate to mankind, contrasting
   it the the creatures of nature:

>     Then the donkey is the greatest scientist and the cow an accomplished naturalist, 
>     for they have obtained what they know without schooling and years of laborious 
>     study in colleges, trusting implicitly to the evidence of the senses and 
>     relying solely upon intuitive virtues.
>             (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 261)

* "spiritual force" - This term force is a physical concept. And it's possible to think
  of spiritual force is being something analogous in the spiritual world. Indeed one may
  hope for spiritual forces so powerful they bring changes in the material world. But what
  does this refer to in reality? The answer may lie in its use in the Baha'i writings.

>   While it is true that its people have attained a marvelous material civilization, 
>   I hope that spiritual forces may animate this great body and a corresponding spiritual 
>   civilization be established.
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 20)

>   May the love of God spread from here onward and outward; may the knowledge of God be 
>   sent broadcast from this place; may spiritual forces become effective here; may the 
>   lights of the Kingdom shine; may intelligent souls be found here so that with all 
>   power they may be occupied in the service of God, furthering the oneness of the 
>   human world and the cause of the Most Great Peace.
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 196)

  What spiritual forces seem to refer to then, are forces created by spiritual acts,
  which in the cases here seem to be those acts that will establish a solid religious
  life and a spiritual civilization. And what is spiritual civilization?

* "spiritual civilization" - This is used to disambiguate civilization in a positive
  sense from a more perjorative, materialistic sense. In this connection, this may
  refer to "civilization" in the old-fashioned sense of being a well-mannered member
  of society, or when referencing a society, as being both socialogically civilized
  and resting on good civic virtues.
  The concept of spiritual civilization is covered at length in _Promulgation of Universal Peace_:

>   ... in material civilization good and evil advance together and maintain 
>   the same pace. For example, consider the material progress of man in the last 
>   decade. Schools and colleges, hospitals, philanthropic institutions, scientific 
>   academies and temples of philosophy have been founded, but hand in hand with 
>   these evidences of development, the invention and production of means and 
>   weapons for human destruction have correspondingly increased.
>        (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 108)

    It seems evident which material signs of civilization are also spiritual
    signs, and which are not.

* "spiritual education" - When this phrase is used, it seems indistinguishable 
   from religious knowledge, virtuous conduct and morals. Morals
   in particular seem emphasised, e.g.

>   Spiritual education made the disciples radiant lamps in the darkness of the 
>   world and caused the Christians of the first and second centuries to become 
>   renowned everywhere for their virtues. Even philosophers bore testimony to 
>   this. Among them was Galen... a celebrated philosopher of the Greeks, although 
>   not a Christian... "In our time there is a certain people called Christians, 
>   who, though neither philosophers nor scholastically trained, are superior to 
>   all others as regards their morality. They are perfect in morals. Each one of 
>   them is like a great philosopher in morals, ethics and turning toward the 
    Kingdom of God.
>        (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 330)

>   Beseech ye the One true God that He may, through the power of the hand 
>   of loving-kindness and spiritual education, purge and purify certain souls 
>   from the defilement of evil passions and corrupt desires
>        (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 170)

* "spiritual darkness" - The meaning of this phrase is not elaborated, but
  is alluded to in examples. It seems to refer to lack of spiritual virtues; e.g.

>   Throughout the Orient in the nineteenth century spiritual darkness prevailed, 
>   and the religions were submerged in the ocean of blind imitations and 
>   adherence to hereditary forms.
>        (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 445)

* "spiritual power" - This phrase is used commonly, especially in more recent
  writing, but is difficult to pin down. Due to its use, it is easy to
  misconceptualize this as some sort of quasi-materialistic power working
  mysteriously in the world. Careful study of its usage elaborates what
  it actually means.

  There are two types of spiritual powers
  elaborated - the spiritual powers of the prophets, and the spiritual 
  powers of man. These are of quite different natures.
  The spiritual powers of the prophets receive particular
  attention in Abdu'l-Baha's _Some Answered Questions_.

>   And that universal Manifestation will subdue the world by spiritual power, 
>   not by war and combat; He will do it with peace and tranquillity, not by 
>   the sword and arms; He will establish this Heavenly Kingdom by true love, 
>   and not by the power of war.
>      (Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 58)

>   You will see, therefore, that at the beginning the Cause of Bahá'u'lláh 
>   was almost unknown, but on account of being a divine Movement it grew and 
>   developed with irresistible spiritual power until in this day, wherever you 
>   travel -- East or West -- and in whatever country you journey, you will 
>   meet Bahá'í assemblies and institutions.
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 44)

>   The atoms of the prophets are just atoms, like all others, but the 
>   association of the great spiritual power with them lives, in the place they 
>   are laid to rest, a spiritual atmosphere, if one can use this expression. 
>   They are, no doubt, endowed with a tremendous spiritual influence and 
>   far-reaching power. But the physical character of Their atoms are not 
>   different from other peoples, any more than Their bodies and physical functions 
>   are differentT.
>       (Compilations, Lights of Guidance, p. 507)

  Other writings of note refer to a similar power which is inherent in mankind itself:

>   Though man has powers and outer senses in common with the animal, yet an 
>   extraordinary power exists in him of which the animal is bereft. The sciences, 
>   arts, inventions, trades and discoveries of realities are the results of 
>   this spiritual power.
>        (Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 186)

>   The animal can neither recognize nor apprehend the spiritual power of man and 
>   makes no distinction between man and itself, for the reason that its 
>   susceptibilities are limited to the plane of the senses.
>        (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 311)

  There is also a "spiritual power" in religious behavior:

>   What every believer, new or old, should realize is that the Cause has the 
>   spiritual power to re-create us if we make the effort to let that power 
>   influence us, and the greatest help in this respect is prayer.
>        (Compilations, Lights of Guidance, p. 115)

  In some cases, the concrete meaning of "spiritual power" is abstracted away, but 
  it refers to the same same as above, the particular powers carried forth by religious cause:

>   Exert yourselves; your mission is unspeakably glorious. Should success crown your 
>   enterprise, America will assuredly evolve into a center from which waves of 
>   spiritual power will emanate, and the throne of the Kingdom of God will, in the 
>   plentitude of its majesty and glory, be firmly established."
>       (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Baha'u'llah, p. 77)

>   The Bahá'í Faith not only provides teachings in accordance with which 
>   the behaviour of human beings can be reformed, but also makes 
>   available a spiritual power which reinforces the devoted efforts of 
>   every believer, whether veteran or neophyte. Arising to serve the Cause 
>   has, itself, a transforming effect upon believers, as the beloved Guardian 
>   wrote with respect to service upon Spiritual Assemblies
>         (The Universal House of Justice, Messages 1963 to 1986, p. 349)

  Finally, there is an old translation in Abdu'l-Baha's _Some Answered Questions_
  where he is said to elborate the spiritual powers of mankind. From the old
  translation:

>   Man has also spiritual powers: imagination, which conceives things; 
>   thought, which reflects upon realities; comprehension, which comprehends 
>   realities; memory, which retains whatever man imagines, thinks and 
>   comprehends. The intermediary between the five outward powers and the 
>   inward powers is the sense which they possess in common -- that is to say, 
>   the sense which acts between the outer and inner powers, conveys to the 
>   inward powers whatever the outer powers discern...
>        (Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 210)

  This requires caution due to the translation itself. The new translation now labels
  these as "inner powers." The passage otherwise does not use the phrase
  "spiritual powers" in any way.

  Given the above, there is now a distinct, unambiguous meaning for the
  phrase "spiritual powers." It is a power to do and encourage spiritual acts,
  where by this is meant acts spiritual as defined in the writings, such as
  virtuous actions and acts of religious devotion.

* "spiritual truth" - A nonmaterial fact, as in:

>   World order can be founded only on an unshakeable consciousness of the oneness 
>   of mankind, a spiritual truth which all the human sciences confirm.
>        (The Universal House of Justice, 1985 Oct, The Promise of World Peace, p. 4)


* "spiritual bounties" - The term spiritual bounties is used frequently, and in
  many cases is simply "bounties." This seems to label any positive thing of
  a spiritual nature.

>   The favors of God are all-surrounding, but should the conscious eye of 
>   the soul of man remain veiled and darkened, he will be led to deny these 
>   universal signs and remain deprived of these manifestations of divine 
>   bounty. Therefore, we must endeavor with heart and soul in order that 
>   the veil covering the eye of inner vision may be removed, that we may 
>   behold the manifestations of the signs of God, discern His mysterious 
>   graces and realize that material blessings as compared with spiritual 
>   bounties are as nothing. The spiritual blessings of God are greatest.
>        (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 90)

  Sometimes this is also referred to as "signs" in the spiritual sense;
  occasionally, "confirmations" refer to a similar sort of thing.

>   Sixth, the world of humanity is in need of the confirmations of the 
>   Holy Spirit. True distinction among mankind is through divine bestowals 
>   and receiving the intuitions of the Holy Spirit. If man does not become 
>   the recipient of the heavenly bestowals and spiritual bounties, he remains 
>   in the plane and kingdom of the animal. For the distinction between the 
>   animal and man is that man is endowed with the potentiality of divinity 
>   in his nature, whereas the animal is entirely bereft of that gift and attainment.
>           (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 317)

* "spiritual qualities" - This is used for an positive spiritual attribute
  in mankind. Indeed, by Baha'i thought, any spiritual attribute must be
  positive in nature, as negative spiritual attributes are simply the absence
  of that attribute.

>   But on the other hand, when man does not open his mind and heart to the blessing 
>   of the spirit, but turns his soul towards the material side, towards the 
>   bodily part of his nature, then is he fallen from his high place and he 
>   becomes inferior to the inhabitants of the lower animal kingdom. In this 
>   case the man is in a sorry plight! For if the spiritual qualities of the soul, 
>   open to the breath of the Divine Spirit, are never used, they become atrophied, 
>   enfeebled, and at last incapable; whilst the soul's material qualities alone 
>   being exercised, they become terribly powerful -- and the unhappy, misguided man, 
>   becomes more savage, more unjust, more vile, more cruel, more malevolent than 
>   the lower animals themselves.
>        (Abdu'l-Baha, Paris Talks, p. 97)

>   In explaining these intellectual realities, one is obliged to express them by 
>   sensible figures because in exterior existence there is nothing that is not material. 
>   Therefore, to explain the reality of the spirit -- its condition, its station -- 
>   one is obliged to give explanations under the forms of sensible things because in 
>   the external world all that exists is sensible. For example, grief and happiness 
>   are intellectual things; when you wish to express those spiritual qualities you say: 
>   "My heart is oppressed; my heart is dilated," though the heart of man is neither 
>   oppressed nor dilated. This is an intellectual or spiritual state, to explain which 
>   you are obliged to have recourse to sensible figures. Another example: you say, 
>   "such an individual made great progress," though he is remaining in the same place; 
>   or again, "such a one's position was exalted," although, like everyone else, he 
>   walks upon the earth. This exaltation and this progress are spiritual states and 
>   intellectual realities, but to explain them you are obliged to have recourse to 
>   sensible figures because in the exterior world there is nothing that is not sensible.
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 83)

>   If we ponder a while over the Qur'ánic verses and proofs, and the traditional 
>   accounts which have come down to us from those stars of the heaven of Divine Unity, 
>   the Holy Imams, we shall be convinced of the fact that if a soul is endowed with the 
>   attributes of true faith and characterized with spiritual qualities he will become to 
>   all mankind an emblem of the outstretched mercies of God. For the attributes of the 
>   people of faith are justice and fair-mindedness; forbearance and compassion and 
>   generosity; consideration for others; candor, trustworthiness, and loyalty; love 
>   and loving-kindness; devotion and determination and humanity.
>       (Abdu'l-Baha, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 55)

>   The absence of spiritual qualities, like darkness, has no existence in itself. As 
>   the light of spirituality penetrates deep into the hearts, this darkness gradually 
>   dissipates and is replaced by virtue.
>       (The Universal House of Justice, 1985 Dec 02, Child Abuse, Psychology and Knowledge of Self)

* "spiritual state" - This is is generally used in opposition to the
sensible state; e.g. a state that is not felt through material means. This may refer
to people or organizations of people.

* "spiritual body" - This unusual reference can be seen to be either cosmological or
practical. For an example of the cosmological meaning: in some belief systems, Christ
was resurrected, but the resurrection was a "spiritual" body rather than a material one. In
fact, some Biblical scholars have posed that the biblical story of "doubting Thomas"
was interjected by those who insisted it was a physical resurrection as well. The Baha'i teachings,
in line with Islamic teachings, believe no actual physical resurrection took place; regarding
a resurrection of the spirit only, Abdu'l-Baha's characterization is noncommital:

>   Therefore, we say that the meaning of Christ's resurrection is as follows: the 
>   disciples were troubled and agitated after the martyrdom of Christ. The Reality of 
>   Christ, which signifies His teachings, His bounties, His perfections and His 
>   spiritual power, was hidden and concealed for two or three days after His martyrdom, 
>   and was not resplendent and manifest. No, rather it was lost, for the believers 
>   were few in number and were troubled and agitated. The Cause of Christ was like a 
>   lifeless body; and when after three days the disciples became assured and steadfast, 
>   and began to serve the Cause of Christ, and resolved to spread the divine teachings, 
>   putting His counsels into practice, and arising to serve Him, the Reality of Christ 
>   became resplendent and His bounty appeared; His religion found life; His teachings 
>   and His admonitions became evident and visible. In other words, the Cause of Christ 
>   was like a lifeless body until the life and the bounty of the Holy Spirit surrounded 
>   it.

>   Such is the meaning of the resurrection of Christ, and this was a true resurrection.
>      (Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 104)

The idea of "spiritual body" seems not to be a description of a "spiritual" part of
a person, and does not fit into the idea of an immaterial projection of our essence, but
is rather spiritual in the sense of divine virtues.

>   The disciples had taken many meals from the hand of Christ; why was the last supper 
>   distinguished from the others? It is evident that the heavenly bread did not signify 
>   this material bread, but rather the divine nourishment of the spiritual body of Christ, 
>   the divine graces and heavenly perfections of which His disciples partook, and with 
>   which they became filled.
>      (Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 99)

* "spiritual vision" - Spiritual vision in the sense of Baha'i teachings is not a mystical
concept, but rather an ability to recognize and understand Baha'i verities:

>   He is praying for the success of this trip, and cherishes the hope that it may 
>   serve to bring into the Cause people of capacity and of true spiritual vision.
>     (Shoghi Effendi, Dawn of a New Day, p. 55)

* "spiritual nature" - In this context, spirituality is opposed to man's material nature.
Spirituality is the immaterial part of mankind reflecting those realities that cannot
be quantitatively measured, such as virtue. Importantly, the spiritual nature of man
is the part that is immortal:

>   Material advancement has been evident in the world, but there is need of spiritual 
>   advancement in like proportion. We must strive unceasingly and without rest to 
    accomplish the development of the spiritual nature in man, and endeavor with 
>   tireless energy to advance humanity toward the nobility of its true and intended 
>   station. For the body of man is accidental; it is of no importance. The time of 
>   its disintegration will inevitably come. But the spirit of man is essential and, 
>   therefore, eternal. It is a divine bounty. It is the effulgence of the Sun of Reality 
>   and, therefore, of greater importance than the physical body.
>         (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 59)

#### Other Definitions of Spirituality under Baha'i Views

The above analysis produces two distinct definitions of spirituality, but that
does not mean the Baha'i Faith does not recongize and validate others. In particular,
the view of "spirituality" as a state of mystical consciousness and union with God
is deeply resonant within the writings, even though the Baha'i writings tend not
to use "spirituality" as a blanket term for such experiences. Indeed, it is possible
it is not addressed explicitly because it is taken for granted. When discussed,
more particular activities are indicated, where use of the modifier "spiritual"
would be redundant. The translated Baha'i corpus has hundreds of written prayers;
the entire untranslated corpus probably thousands. A search for "meditation" 
in the Ocean search engine turns up
over six hundred mentions, and "prayer" turns up over six thousand!
Perhaps if the Baha'i Faith had been revealed in a more secular society, there
would have been much need to extol the "spirituality" inherent in prayerful,
meditative states.

There are other uses of "spirituality" that are not ratified in the light of
Baha'i teachings. The Baha'i view of spirituality is plainly incompatible with
materialistic views of spirituality as empty uplifting yearnings or impulses
borne of magical thinking. Likewise, the Baha'i cosmology poses a deep connection between both
the spiritual world and the physical world, but steers clear of "spiritual
materialism." Instead, the writings indicate the main conduit
are the Manifestations of God and the actions of His dedicated believers. The
fanatical view of spirituality, which poses a world populated by unseen angels
and demons and myriad interactions
between mystical "spiritual forces" and this world, finds little support within
the Baha'i writings. While 
Baha'u'llah and Abdu'l-Baha' never contradicted this
outlook explicitly, the plain interpretation of their writings was to interpret
such things as due to the actions of the spiritually enlightened in this world.
Rumors of Baha'u'llah's miracles were purposely left
undocumented, and when documented in _The Dawnbreakers_, were not translated by The Guardian. 
Abdu'l-Baha even poses a definition of "angels" that reframes this as meaning
the actions of holy people rather than disembodied entities.

Likewise, "spirituality" is rarely used as a synonym for religious faith. There is
little support in the writings for the "salvation through faith" found in
more fideistic creeds. Indeed, the term "faith" itself has a very different
definition under the Baha'i Faith, as per a long-translated admonishion from
Abdu'l-Baha: "By faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, 
and second, the practice of good deeds." (Compilations, Baha'i World Faith, p. 383).
When faith is spiritual, it never consists of simply believing in something
without proof.

Finally, the spirituality of the Baha'i Faith is the spirituality borne of
good deeds, virtuous conduct and occasional hard work. The commercial concept
of "spirituality" as a packaged, low-stress indulgence is incompatible with
Baha'i belief. As a Baha'i, one may happily travel to exotic climes and meditate
in the most inspiring places; indeed, Shoghi Effendi was know for escaping to
Switzerland for vacations from his famously overworked schedule. But Baha'is know
that he was carrying out his most important work during his periods of overwork,
not during his escape.

## Concluding Thoughts

Presently, study of spirituality is thought of as a strictly religious concern.
Material concerns are thought of as the domain entirely of science. True materialists
handle talk of the "spiritual" by dismissing it entirely. Those who wish to keep
the scientific pursuit while acknowledging the spiritual hedge this by thinking
of the spiritual and material as two different "magesteria"; e.g. the study of
material or measurable things is the purview of science only, and anything spiritual
is the purview of the religious. The prevelance of this view means that most people
assume these two things are true about spirituality:

* Spiritual things cannot be _emperically studied_. Spiritual claims are, by
definition, not testable. If it were testable, it would be subject to scientific
investigation and therefore, not spiritual.

* Spiritual things are entirely personal in nature. This generally follows by
the claims of nontestability. A materialist may uphold spirituality, but only
by believing that it is a force that is essentially personal, as it differs
from person to person.

If we believe these claims, then indeed, "spirituality"
is too fuzy and amorphous to be worth any sort of serious study, an emic folk
concept used to cover up inarticulated personal feelings.
The question is - are these two claims actually true?

When one considers the different forms of spirituality outlined in the Baha'i writings,
the answer is clear, but it depends upon which "spirituality" is meant. If by
"spirituality," one only referring to the "cosmological" description regarding
the spiritual as immaterial forms outside of nature, the
forms of neoplatonist, idealist or other metaphysical thought, then plainly
the first claim is correct; such metaphysical claims are not emperically testable. 
This author suspects this
is the why theologians studying the spiritual used logic of increasing
rigor and formality over history - because
reason is the only way to intellectually flesh out such realities. The second
claim is incorrect; if there is a well-defined conception of spirituality, then
this must hold for everyone. That is, if there is a "spiritual" nature, it 
must hold to the same logical imperatives
for everyone.

Additionally, both claims are untrue of the Baha'i "practical" 
defintion of spirituality, which refers to a host of attibutes and behaviors
as spiritual. Even accross cultures, concepts such as goodness, virtue
and religious dedication and are understood by all. Far from being
nebulous, such things can be defined and studied. A cursory
review of some of the concepts above - "spiritual virtues," "spiritual bounties,"
"spiritual vision," "spiritual body," etc. - shows that these are things that
describe actions and things that are visible in the world, and easily
recognizeable as part of the human experience. One need not have faith in
invisible worlds; one need only have faith in the human spirit to believe in
the reality of such things.
The fact that analytic
philosophers cannot rigorously define entities such as "virtue" and "moral goodness"
does not mean such things are not real. To Baha'is, these
things are important, it is important to advance in the understanding of
"spiritual things," and it will not do to simply throw up our hands
and regard them as unknowable mysteries just because emperical material
definitions are hard to come by.

Before ending this examination, one thing is important to note. From the Baha'i 
point of view, at its basis, the difference between the "cosmological" and
"practical" definitions of spirituality is not a distinction between two
different but similar things. Instead, it should be regarded as a distinction 
in viewpoint. The things that are described
as "spiritual" are not simply _like_ things in the spiritual world - they _are_
of things in the spiritual world. For instance, the use of "spiritual force" seems
to refer to things impelling things such as virtuous conduct and religious devotion,
as opposed to mystic forces acting in the material world. For instance, there is
this statement:

>   Although outwardly cataclysms are hard to understand and to endure, yet there 
>   lies a great wisdom behind them which appears later. All the visible material 
>   events are inter-related with invisible spiritual forces. The infinite phenomena 
>   of creation are as interdependent as the links of a chain.
>          (Abdu'l-Baha, Divine Philosophy, p. 116)

This is from an old Baha'i text, using possibly a faulty translation, but the 
underlying meaning is probably still accurate.
In Baha'i thought, spiritual forces are present in the world; the main distinction
between the Baha'i Faith and the other religious is Baha'u'llah's revelation, and
in it, He has spelled out this interface between the spiritual and the material
in such writings as "The Tablet of All Food." Exploration of this concept is out of the
scope of this writing, but Baha'is, like many religions before it, believe
such things as moral reals, virtues and other key phenomenological entities
in the human experience are actually spiritual things, in the sense of being
entities in the spirit world. The fact that one can actually characterize and
experience their effects does not make them any less spiritual. 

From the point of view of the most materialist materialist philosophers, 
these two things are also
two sides of the same coin as well. The more extreme analytic philosophers
are not simply skeptical about God and spirituality, but also skeptical
about "The Good," "The Beautiful," virtuous conduct, and a
host of other human concerns we find real but that they find to be undefineable
and untestable, and hence, meaningless.

In conclusion, in the Baha'i writings, the world "spiritual" is used to
describe certain things that exist as part of the human experience. Far from
being a "weasel world" used to facilitate implausible claims or imprecise
communication, it signifies important concepts that are recognized even by
those who claim antipathy to anything spiritual. For those of us in the Baha'i
Faith seeking to build a "spiritual civilization," it is important to remember
what that means.
