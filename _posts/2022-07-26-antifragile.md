## _Antifragile_: A Brief Book Review

This is a quick note to myself and others regarding the book
_Antifragile_ by Nicholas Nassim Talib. It is not intended to be
thorough. It's just a restatement of some of the good points that are
worth remembering.

If you want a review of the book, I'll give you one very briefly: strong points include
a few very non-obvious points about life that are worth learning. You'll learn them
thoroughly in the reading because they are explored at length. Weak points include a
lot of ego-driven score-settling; I won't detail what they are.
As a bonus, even though he claims that his book is
written from his own experience and his ideas do not come from libraries, 
the references he does provide
are very good, and one can't help but wonder, when reading _Antifragile_, if maybe
one shouldn't be reading sone of the referenced books instead (that's not 
meant as a slight - I said his reference list is _good_). If you are involved
in finance, and you haven't been reading _Thinking Fast and Slow_, then that should
be at the top of your list, not _Antifragile_. All that being said, it was still enjoyable
if occasionally uncomfortable. If you haven't read _Fooled By Randomness_, I'd
start there, and then only pick up this book if you're OK with this author's style.

Otherise here's the main points, in no particular order:

His key theme/discovery is the term of "antifragile." He defines it thusly: "fragile"
things are brittle and break in the face of shocks; "robust things" are always stable.
Something that is "antifragile" is robust in the face of shocks but tends to go to
rotten if there is a notable _lack_ of stressors. Antifragile things come with a caveat,
though: nothing is forever, and you can't stress an antifragile thing TOO much. Taleb
seems drawn towards antifragile things and writes on about how human bodies and cities
and civilizations are all antifragile, though I'm not so sure that is somehow better
than simply being robust. He might very well reply that truly robust things are very
rare, while antifragile things are rather commoner. The lesson one draws from this is
that once an object is identified as antifragile - say, your own body - one does _not_
react by trying to protect it from stressors. Instead, one is probably better off simply
ignoring stressors. This has the additional benefit of reducing fear of the unknown and
allowing you to not care so much about potential threats, since unless the stressor is
truly catastrophic, there is little you can do. One should instead welcome such
occasional discomforts. As told, it seems like a bit of folk wisdom, though one can
easily see how this can be true of people, children, cultures, creeds, and a host
of other human and natural concerns.

An antifragile portfolio is discussed, though not at the length as I wanted to
see (after all, Taleb _is_ a finance guy). His recommendation is a "barbell strategy"
consisting of:
* A large amount of ultra-safe assets. We're talking: cash and treasury bonds. NO RISK.
* A smaller portfolio of _extremely_ volatile assets; e.g. startup stop, deeply
out-of-the-money options (in both directions), and so on.

As you can see, this is antifragile - makes no money (indeed, loses a bit of money)
during predictable period of low market volatility, but thrives in a 
regime of volatility and uncertainty.
The underlying theory behind this, so very well-articulated in _Fooled by Randomness_,
is that mathematical models for predicting future events do not properly account for
unforseen events. Indeed, Taleb's assertion is that you can't simply account for this
by using "fat-tailed" distributions or "scalar" distributions - a trick quants have
used for years. Instead, the only way to avoid portfolio-ruining-but-inevitable 
once-in-a-lifetime events, according to Taleb, is this "antifragile" portfolio.

Here's where I, the critic, come in. This is not an untested theory. If there is a
trading strategy that can be imagined, it has been tried. And indeed, others have tried
these sorts of strategies before. These sorts of "Texas long-shot" portfolios have
been tried, and have gotten in the papers, only to never be replicated. 
Taleb may be making oodles of money off of this - if he is, good for him - but my
understanding is he did have a hedge fund that did exactly that (I don't recall the
reference, but he was the protagonist for a _New Yorker_ article that I read before
the release of _Fooled by Randomess_, and ) and I'm not sure it's still around.
To my naive mind, I can think of two big practical problems that would keep me
from using this:

1. You can spend _years_ in normal market conditions between periods of extreme
volatility, and during that time, you can experience substantial "notional" losses;
the opportunity cost of large amounts of cash in ultra-safe portfolios has been quite
large over a regime of regular 6-8% annualized S&P yields. Any fund that played
this strategy during the long low volatility periods of mid-2000s and mid-20102
would probably have shut down due to client withdrawls.

2. For an _individual investor_ such as yourself, it is very unlikely your portfolio
of volatile assets will be sufficiently diversified. Essentially, you need to cover enough
high-unlikelihood events to benefit when one happens, to make up for the years of negative
returns. It's unlikely that you, as an individual investor, will have enough
"fingers in the pie" to benefit. Here's an analogy: supposing 
there were a 10-million dollar lottery drawing
and there were only 1 million 1-dollar tickets outstanding. The "expected value" of
a lottery ticket is $10 - a tenfold increase! - but the only way you can be guaranteed
to realize this increase is to own a large share of the outstanding lottery tickets! 
Likewise, your high-volatility
portfolio is going to need a heck of a lot of lottery tickets.

Another useful point is a metaphilosophical one Taleb points out and elaborates repeatedly:

_The expected life of something is proportional to how long it has been around
already. Something that is new is *much less* likely to be around in ten years than
something that has already been around for twenty years. This applies to technology,
culture, and any other phenomenon._

Taleb acts like this is something of a revelation, but given his background, he should
know this. Expected lifetimes of objects - where the object is unknown - are sometimes
modeled using an exponential distribution (it looks sort of like a continuous verions
of a poisson distribution). The expected value of the subsequent lifetime of an object is
_whatever its current lifetime is right now_. If 
something's been around for 10 years, expect it to be around for,
on average, another 10 years. You can't say what the
distribution is, of course, but there is a nontrival chance it will be around much
longer - and a much greater chance it will outlive something that has just been invented.

Those of you who leave things to "early adopters" to try out all the bugs first may
well be onto something. The bad news, of course, is that since bitcoin has been around
for 12 years, you probably have to wait at least another 12 to guarantee you'll never
hear about it again (though perhaps it will disappear off the financial front pages
much more quickly, since it's only been there for about five years). And Taleb 
rightly points out that skeptics waiting for the death
of religious belief are going to find themselves waiting for an extremely long time.

There is much else covered here, but these are the two points that are going to
stick with me. That, and the fact that "predicting is hard, especially about future
events."
