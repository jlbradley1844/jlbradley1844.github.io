## On Sick Societies

Another Baha'i-related post. The impetus is a book I recently read. It is
_Sick Societies_ (1992) by Robert B. Edgerton. It is an anthropology book. The
thesis is spelled out by its subtitle: "Challenging the Myth of Primitive Harmony."

The title of the book implies it is an examination of societies that were notably
bad and maladaptive, but Edgerton's aim in writing this was simpler. He wished to show
the following: as flawed as we viewed as contemporary societies, the presumption that the
primitive societies are somehow better and healthier, even perhaps more
ethical is false.
Edgerton challenged the assumption, made by many of the anthropologists in relatively
recent past, that
all cultural practices by primitive societies are somehow _adaptive_, no matter
how strange they may seem to modern eyes.
In the book Edgerton showed that contrary to that expectation, many such societies
do not thrive and were in decline even before contact with colonial cultures due
to maladaptive behaviors - cultural values so inappropriate that they posed
actual existential threats to the life of the community.

Why would anthropologists hold this belief in the first place? Much of it is due
to the history of the field. Early
groundbreaking research by Margaret Mead et. al. showed that many native cultures were
far more advanced and "cultured" than the 
early jingoistic imperialists gave them credit for, and the collapse
of many native cultures was found to have not been due to their natural inferiority,
but due to the abuse, injustice and downright murderous behavior of the conquering cultures.
Early anthropology shifted from being a tool used to justify subjigation to one
that sought a sympathetic understanding of studied cultures. Given this background, it is easy
to see why contemporary anthropologists are inclined to take a far more pluralistic,
nuanced view of native practice. Over time, the field grew to oversympathize with studied
cultures, to the point where every culture was not seen as "different, not wrong" and,
in some cases, claimed to be perfectly attuned to the environment.

The thesis of this book is simple enough, and given the thirty years that have
passed since its writing, its main points have probably been digested by
the field of anthropology.
The idea that things naturally "evolve" in an adaptive direction, functionalism,
was generally retired by biologists in the 1960s, yet it seemed at the time of
writing the bulk of anthropologists still held a similar presumption - that any
notable trait unique to social culture must _somehow_ be adaptive.
To this end, all Edgerton has to do to prove his thesis is to show that throughout
a variety of cultures, obviously maladaptive beliefs are held by societies which
nevertheless were able to thrive in spite of them. The reminds me of the original
definition of "political incorrectness" used by left-leaning academics in the nineties -
the recognition that sometimes,
the instincts of blockheaded barstool conservatives are correct. Educators who realized
sometimes Johnny is bad because he was never punished, social
workers with cases who were on welfare was because they truly didn't
want to worki... add to that primitive societies whose behaviors really were
cruel, vicious, maladaptive and, um, primitive. Even in the context of primitive cultures.

To make his case, Edgerton dedicated something over half of the book's two hundred pages
to cataloging
documented practices in primitive societies, practices that seem obviously, provably
maladaptive. That such a catalog can be made is not surprising.
As maladaptive as many of the practices detailed
by Edgerton are, some societies that practiced these thrived in spite of 
these behaviors. This in itself would be enought to discourage any inclination to
automatically regard all features of a culture as adaptive. However, in the bulk of
cases, he showed that many flawed primitive societies, far from thriving, were actually
seriously hobbled by these practices, and many of the societies that collapsed quickly
upon contact with western civilization were already in serious decline because of
these practices. This gave lie to the assumption that all primitive cultures collapsed
due to the brutality of imperialists.
To give one example from the book, native Tasmanian culture quickly
collapsed upon contact with colonialists due to the fact that the natives in their
trival society were, well, miserable. Completely lacking any even moderately advanced
stone-aged technology and balkanized into small tribes in constant warfare 
with other tribes, their long-lived culture collapsed
with hardly even a push - a far cry from the many Native American and Africa tribes that
held strong and gave their colonizers fits. Witness also the mighty Aztec empire, which
collapsed upon the first encounter with Spaniard conquistadors, undermined
by the many enemies they made due to their brutal practices, such as picking human
sacrifices from their conquered tribes.

I had no trouble at all reading and digesting the contents of this book, which
makes me suspicious - if I'm actually learning something new, there will be some
concept somewhere that I have trouble wrapping my head around. But instead,
I breezed through this book, which made me wonder if I was just confirming
my own prejudices. Part of my doubt is because it seemed Edgerton might be attacking a
straw man - did anthropologists of the eighties _really_ think all societies were
somehow perfectly fined-tuned, culturally, to their own survival? Did all of the
primitive social mores somehow serve the community, no matter how backwards the
taboos seemed to be? While Edgerton had not trouble finding examples of
anthropologists falling victim to this belief, making embarassing attempts
to explain away such recognized
evil as female genetic mutilation, human sacrifice and the like as somehow being
"adaptive", I suspect that anthropologists already knew this on some level even
at that time. After all, were anthropologists determined to look past
such behavior, Edgerton would have had no raw material for this book! 

Unfortunately, even if anthropologists have a more nuanced view,
the greater culture at large seems not to have picked up this
lesson. Instead, many cling to a naive relativism that idealizes pre-agricultural
societies, believing such cultures as automatically superior in many ways. 
Health cure ~quacks~ practitioners are quick to hawk ancient folk remedies,
no matter how unproven. New Age movements insist that ancient tribal societies were
egalitarian and nonsexist (they weren't), that their Goddess-oriented religions were
inclusive and uplifting (no again), and emulate what they imagine to be 
original primitive religions,
naturally including enlightenment-era notions of equality and liberalism unheard of in primitive
societies. Moral relativists, conflating the concept of "adaptiveness" with
ethical right and wrong, believe mistakenly that the functioning of such societies
proves there are no moral absolutes. Meanwhile, conservative moralists, who should
bristle at such relativistic thought, instead interpret the frequency of common tribal practices of
patriarchy, sexism and conquest as elevating and justifying their continued practice,
as if they represent unfixed characteristics of "human nature" to be celebrated. Such
people have all forgotten that just because you find a society practicing
something - even if a lot of them do it - doesn't make it right or wrong. Indeed, there
may be no normative lessons to be learned by blindly imitating native cultures. 
Unfortunately, the half-learned lessons of "soft sciences" like anthropology frequently
wind up entering popular social discourse through motivated reasoning.

-----------------------------------------------

What I find interesting - and what I hope I can understand a Baha'i - are
some of the pathologies Edgerton repeatedly identifies. At this point I have
read a grand total of (1) serious anthropology book, so I can hardly be said
to be studied in this field, and I'm probably not qualified to even write the
above paragraphs. However, I think I can comment on the many examples
he found of maladaptive behavior without embarassing myself.

One of the more interesting things in Edgerton's writings is his finding that certain
socially maladaptive practices come up in native societies again and again. If there is
something to be learned from the study of such maladaptive practices, is that certain
human behaviors which are "natural" enough to be accepted 
are maladaptive to society. It is easy to explain the presence of practices 
which are maladaptive to society but adaptive
to _individuals_ in the society. But there are also practices
that are inexplicably common despite being maladaptive to
both societies that countenance it and individuals that practice it. 
Here's an enumeration of the broader categories of common maladaptions:

1. _Gender inequality_. Women in many societies suffer at the hands of men to a
extent that is maladaptive. This isn't just the "he never helps with the dishes" inequality,
but far more serious issues. The sorts of things documented include:
 *  Cultures where women are malnourished and have stunted growth
    due to lack of protien, which is all consumed by the men. 
 *  Serious inequality in the division of labor; e.g. women spending entire time
    in food-gathering and child-rearing while men have an occasional hunting
    trip (and eat all of the meat themselves).
 *  Brutal forms of female genital mutilation. 
 *  An expectation that wives (usually multiple) can and should be beaten
 *  Sexual slavery, and the capture of women in warfare.

Inequality between the sexes is common but not always maladaptive. However, in many
of the cultures studied of these cultures, this inequality actually hurt the flourishing of the 
tribe in several ways: the unhelathiness
of the women meant increased infant mortality, medical sterility, suicides by women
of childbearing age and deaths during 
childbirth. In some of the societies Edgerton studies, the genders in the tribe are at
a state of near-constant warfare with one another, with the men's control of resources
being the only thing that bound the genders together. 
Edgerton documents one tribe
which died out because they traded away too many of their women of childbearing
age to eager western colonists. The women were only too happy to
leave their miserable lot for whatever the colonists had in store. One could hardly 
blame colonialism for that culture's collapse.

2. _Mistreatment of children_. One of the more shocking findings is that in a surprising number
of cultures, children in most primitive cultures are generally ignored and left to fend for
themselves. This is not the "benign neglect" of our rural forefathers, where
children were minimally educated and fed and otherwise left to sort their own problems out.
This was qualitatively different; the cultures did not view children as an investment, but a
resource drain, and acted accordingly. No particular effort was made to cultivate 
their education or development, or even guarantee access to food.
Once weaned, children were often taken advantage of and malnourished. Nor were babies
particularly cared for; infanticide was common. 
Here again, Edgerton is not simply talking about practices that simply seem unfamiliar or unethical
to western cultures, but levels of abuse that are maladaptive, in that they present
a challenge to the continued propagation of the culture in the form of excess
deaths before childbearing ages.

3. _Taboos and superstition_. Anthropologists have long thought of many taboos as
being adaptive - warnings about the dangers of the natural world that assisted the
survival of cultures. Many have speculated that, for instance, the banning of pork
in Judaism and other kosher laws was adaptive because it prevented the
sorts of serious diseases that come from the improper handling of those sorts of foods.
One can imagine taboos against poisonous plants, animals, disease-causing
practices, and sexual behaviors like incest as being particularly adaptive.
However, Edgerton shows that generally taboos were not nearly so helpful and
seemed to have no value in practice.
Many taboos actually resulted in behaviors that resulted in
forgoing important sources of nutrition and protien, or sexual practices which
actually made conception difficult. Naturally, when anthropologists queried the
studied natives on the reason for such taboos, no valid reasons were given; e.g.
"it's the way it's always been done."

4. _Fear of witchcraft_. Scapegoating is a common feature of social life, and it
has been suggested by some anthropologists that the frequent invention of "witches"
in primitive cultures is somehow adaptive, in that it allows 
the elimination of "troublemakers". Edgerton
shows through multiple examples how this was generally not the case; instead, when
stressful events happened in the community, instead of a logical search for the
cause, witchcraft was generally blamed, resulting in the search for a nonexistent
culprit. One small tribe in central New Guinea, the Gebusi, were a seemingly healthy,
noncompetitive, nonviolent people that nevertheless believed all illnesses were caused
by witchcraft, and their homocide rate was one of the highest ever recorded among
small-scale primitive societies: one third of all deaths were due to murder of accused
witches. Related to this, bogus pronouncements by "prophets" could sometimes lead
to disasters. He relates one African tribe that nearly drove itself to extinction
when a prophet convinced a cattle-raising tribe to sacrifice nearly all of their
cattle as an atonement for witchcraft. Note that the problem was "witchcraft", yet
Edgerton has almost no examples of "wizardry" being a problem.
The fact that perpetrators of evil magic
were almost always identified as women past childbearing age is not surprising given
the maladaptive sexism of many of these cultures.

5. _Persistent warfare_. Anthropologists have had no trouble identifying cultures
in which warfare was not an occurrence - even for those with neighbors in close
competition for resources. Contrariwise, it is certainly maladaptive for a primitive
culture to adopt a pacificstic stance to a warlike neighbor. So one 
could certainly make the case for a certain level of warfare - or at least, conflict
readiness - as being adaptive. Unfortuntely, Edgerton's review of cultures shows
that many cultures are warlike in attitude, and such cultures almost always
find a way to make this trait maladaptive. Warlike cultures tended to glorify fighting 
and fierceness for its own sake,
making it hard to limit violence where it was only truly necessary. Many
of the cultures studied lived in a near constant state of warfare.
Such cultures commonly lose a measurable percentage of their useful population
each year to fighting - making it hard to maintain a stable population. 
Additionally, fighting with one's neighboring tribes seems to be highly correlated with fighting
among oneself. 

6. While reasons given for warfare seemed to be numerous, one reason did come
frequently: the capture of nubile young women. One would imagine
that some anthropologists would explain that is adaptive, since a warlike
society would need an increased birthrate. Yet in such societies, the young warriors
were quite blunt that the main reason they took female captives was for their
own pleasure, not to replenish the tribe. Such warfare over mating partners could
lead to depopulation; the tiny Kaiadilit tribe, the only inhabitants of remote Bentinck
Island had virtual no outside contact until anthropological expeditions in 1942, which
found them in a state of population collapse. The reason turned out to be constant
warfare and feuding over women and the pursuit of women. Any imagined "adaptiveness"
by allowing only the fittest warriors access to mates was mooted by the enormous disruption to
subsistence activities caused by fighting and feuding.

7. _Gross inequality_. The common conception of early
hunter-gatherer societies is that they were egalitarian, and it was not until the large agricultural
societies that the gross inequalities that characterized these empires came into
being. It is true that in those early societies, there were no _signifiers_ indicating
unequal status. However, many of these societies could still be 
very unequal _in practice_. For instance,
if there was any food to be had, the healthy males were guaranteed to eat well, before
any women and children had a bite. Once a tribe was large enough to have a formal
leadership, it was common for those leaders to take the lion's share of any
spoils from hunting or warefare, even for those societies of hunter-gatherers.
Such injustices generally were not maladaptive, in that they did not prevent
the society from functioning. Yet the obvious consequence of this was internal strife.
When many members of a society are miserable, there are a number of ways unhappy members
can fight back or rebel. A chief who makes too much of his privileges is liable to
suffer "rough justice" if too many people are made unhappy. A culture experiencing a series of
chiefs of this sort is one that will expect their leaders to take advantage of them,
with a resulting lack of trust whenever the leaders actually have to ask tribal members
for any sort of sacrifice.

To reiterate, these are practices that were accepted and seen as _normative_.
Edgerton points out there are plenty of malidaptive practices that native cultures
called out and condemned. For instance, food hoarding seemed to be a common
occurence in these societies, even though most tribal social norms encouraged the sharing
of food and other resources. Sharing was seen as normative even though
commonly it was not practiced. But those behaviors listed above were accepted as normative;
it represented "the way things have always been," and even among those unhappy with
their lot, it was accepted as natural. Likewise, it was seen as impossible to ever
change such practices.

Edgerton gives several examples of societies that were able to reform some of these
maladaptive tendencies - breaking longstanding taboos to take advantage of new
sources of nutrition, adopting peaceful stances with their neighbors, reducing unequal
social practices and the like. Unfortunately,
such reforms were rare, and were
always made at the insistence of a strong leader, who was willing to both sacrifice some
of his own privileges and make other strong members of the society go along with it.
For instance, the chieftan of Kapauku of Papau New Guinea 
was able to reform overly-strict incest rules that threatened tribal flourishing (selfishly,
it was because he personally wanted to marry someone forbidden to him). 
However, it was common for such efforts to fail. Edgerton gives the example
of Knife Chief, a legendary chief of the Skidi Pawnee tribe of Nebraska, who undertook the 
effort to rid his tribe of the custom of human sacrifice. This effort failed, and historians
believe the practice continued until at least 1834.

Why are these maladaptive characteristics so common? Why were the difficult to change?
Any one of these characteristics, if taken to the extreme levels documented, could doom a society.
It was very uncommon to see a society with all of these behaviors, yet
it was also rare to find a society that did not show at least a bit of these pathologies.
Edgerton points out that many of these features are common in spite of their negative
cultural effects because they are adaptive to particular individuals. These were features
of society not in spite of maladaptiveness, but because some strong individuals wanted
these to be features of the society.

What does this have to do with the Baha'i writings? Well, this may explain the
receptivity of the Baha'i message for such people.

A bit of background may be necessary. Sixty years ago, the Baha'i 
Faith was a smallish new religous movement
centered around a few hundred thousand believers Iran, and perhaps twenty thousand North Americans
and a somewhat smaller number of Europeans serving as an important and influential but somewhat 
peripatetic minority. By the turn of the millenia,
most statisticians estimated there were perhaps five million Baha'is, with the majority of the
believers in the developing world; that is, NOT in Iran, North America or Europe. How did this happen?
Mainly through a surge of both missionary work and interest among the sorts of less developed
communities - the same sorts of communities that Edgerton's book details. The Baha'i Faith 
had a number of teachings that
were fairly novel for an evangelistic religion. Foremost was a belief system that confirmed
and accepted the validity of their own indigenous belief system. But there were other
teachings that resonated in these communities:

* An emphasis on jusice and equality in dealings;
* Upliftment of the status of women;
* An emphasis on education - even higher education - and proper childrearing;
* The importance of science and proper agricultural practices and elimination of superstition;
* The avoidance of violence and the emphasis on peaceful resolutions to disagreements.

When one views this in the context of the maladaptive behaviors shown by many native
cultures, it seems evident why many who were eager to retain their culture were also
eager to embrace the Baha'i Faith. It also seems evident why in a few notable cases,
reform-minded chieftans were able to bring the whole tribe along.
For every one of these common maladaptive behaviors
identified by Edgerton, there seemed to be a Baha'i teaching aimed directly at modifying
or eliminating the behavior.

The spiritual "center of gravity" of the Baha'i Faith is now firmly in the
developing world, something which would surprise the mid-twentieth century observers
of the Baha'i Faith in America, who would've noted the fact that the Baha'i Faith drew
from the more educated classes - and therefore was probably a better fit for "the elites"
in the cities of the developing world than of the less developed areas.
As it turns out, the Baha'i Faith in its actuality had more salience to the less developed
areas than the developing world cities, whose elites had always somehow been taken care of.
It also shows that receptivity of the Baha'i Faith (indeed, for any religious movement)
depends on a degree of self-reflection by the society; preening self-satisfaction with
one's lot is hardly conducive to critical reflection on flaws and how they may be addressed.
At the present, with the migration to the
cities throughout the developing world, such solutions presented by the Baha'i Faith
may seem less salient over the years. 
Still, if Edgerton books shows us anything, it's that maladaptive behaviors will
continue to be a feature of societies, as long as there's a significant enough minority
of people who benefit from these behaviors. If the Baha'i Faith is to continue to grow
and flourish, it must continue to show its salience by showing how its teachings can
continue to address the maladaptive norms of society, no matter what form.

-------------------------------------------

Presently in "the West," the Baha'i Faith has entered a long period of slow-/no-growth.
Some have suspected this is due to creeping secularization; others have pointed out
that religious movements (including the Baha'is) tend toward growth stagnation during
periods of affluence and lack of social stressors. My opinion is it may be a bit of the former; but
as to the latter, there seem to be no lack of stressors, in spite of the fact
so few go without food. Nor is there any lack of
maladaptive cultural beliefs. However, identifying the maladaptive beliefs is anything but
straightforward. The temptation is to place maladaptive practices as being the fault of
ethnic or cultural "others," rather than properly seeing them as a property of the whole of society.

The more secular and scientifically-minded will identify their own problems threatening
the survival of modern "western" society:

* Uncontrolled, immoderate extremes of wealth and poverty;
* Short-sighted destruction of natural habitats and wasteful explotation of naural resources;
* Inability of large segments of society to think critically, rendering them 
vulnerable to propaganda and misuse at the hands of others;
* The continuing appeal of superstition and "magical thinking" in the solution to social problems;
* The persistence of racial prejudice and tribal preferentialism;
* The unreflective adulation and emulation of the weathy, as the "deserving winners" of a meritocracy;

As for the more religiously-minded, since I'm making the list, I'm going to disregard
those believers who feel cultural reform can best be found in outworn, discarded
creeds of nationalism, racialism or leadership by a religious order. That still leaves
many valid concerns of the large number of
thoughtful religious believers, who believes society suffers 
from a different set of problems threatening its survival:

* A crass libertarian materialism that seeks to label any moneymaking venture as
inherently worthy, no matter what undesireable side-effects may result.
* The elevation of paid work to the central concern of life, and a "hustle culture" that
gorifies a committment to paid work at the expense of domestic life and public life;
* The exclusion of spiritual concerns from discussions of public life, and emptiness of
public enterntainment and discourse;
* An excessively individualism that cultivate a culture of shameless self-aggrandizement;
* The "perpetual adolescence" cultivated in young adults and the postponement of mature
relationships until their final childbearing years (note: men have biological clocks too);
* A reflexive relativism that refuses to label recognized blameworthy behaviors as such.

My opinion on this is not that one side is right, and another wrong, but that _they're
both right_.

From the point of view of an adaptive society, a society which is constantly losing people
is maladapted. And indeed, one item of concern to many conservatives has been the 
collapse of birth rates in the developed world. While some have noted that this is only
a problem if there is some _other_, more appealing society which people are flocking to,
this diagnosis does have an intuitive appeal. If society is flourishing, why would so
many men and women be unable to contract marriages? Why would young married couples have to postpone
childbearing for fiscal reasons until conception becomes difficult?

Unfortunately, it only seems to be political conservatives
that have labeled this as a problem. And I'm afraid ther proposed "solutions" are nonserious;
no action besides jawboning married women of preferred ethnicities to have more babies.
Notably, such commentors are rarely concerned about other
existential threats, as if a slightly below-replacement population growth is the _only_
challenge facing the economically advanced world. If your view is that having
families is not a part of life, but instead a privelege reserved for "the winners," and you feel
the only people who deserve to be winners are "your people," then complaining about "the right people"
not having enough children is really the only option you have for fixing this problem.

This comment some rando posted on <slashdot.org> imitating the sort of nagging 
concern-trolling about the birthrate says the actual problem better than I could:

>  We want babies, lots of them, and we want YOU to bear the costs of raising them.
>  Also we want to skim off the top of the costs you must bear just to have a chance at making them.
>  Also, we still want to overwork you and underpay you and leave you with no life of your own apart from this.

My own viewpoint is that low birth rates are a lagging indicate of an unhealthy society - one
in which there are too few jobs that can raise a family; too few men (and women) who, thanks to
delayed adolescense, are not mature enough to make the necessary tradeoffs to make a marriage and
family work in their prime childbearing years; too little emphasis on the spiritual qualities that
make one a decent marriage partner; and too few politicians willing to spell out that
solving pratical roadblocks for family formation like affordable housing and childcare will require
sacrifice from those who would prefer to have lower taxes, an earlier retirement, 
and a house-as-an-investment which is guaranteed to fund said early retirement. Let's 
not forget that it's difficult to have children
when one is deeply pessimistic in the future. The present inability of scientifically advanced
cultures to collectively even acknowledge, let alone deal with 
obvious existential yet avoidable problems such as
global warming is not encouraging, if you and your potential spouse is 
considering whether or not to "choose life" 
and bring offspring into the world. Neither
is it conducive to family formation among the working classes when the best that a 
married pair of high school graduate can hope
for in many cases is a series of unending low wage jobs with unstable hours that cannot 
purchase access to stable housing
in an environment safe for childrearing. I don't think religious conservatives are being foolish when
they want to encourage marriage among the working classes. But they are if they think somehow
marriage alone will magically fix these other problems.

About a year ago, the _New York Times_ published an article in which they researched low childbirth
rates for American women. It turns out that in general, women generally have fewer children than they want, 
sometimes far fewer, and
the gap between the desired number of children and actual number of children was more than enough to
make up for the fertility shortfall. Why would women have fewer children than they wish?
They named the actual practical reasons, the largest of which included:

* Unable to contract a suitable _stable_ marriage partner
* Got married too late
* Need to work interfered with having additional children

Anyone with more than a minute's reflection could have pinpointed these as being the core problems.
These are problems stemming from our present culture, problems that cannot be laid at the feet of 
women who are "too career-centered," "too picky," "too selfish" or the like. These
problems do nothing but reflect the pathologies of our present society. Women from favored cultures
blessed with good looks and affluent, professional husbands are generally not the people going around childless, 
and religious believers who think the solution for the fertility gap lies in asking such women
to make more babies are fishing in the wrong pond.

I'm a Baha'i, and that means I think the maladaptive behaviors of developed societies can be
just as well addressed by our teachings as those of the more primitive societies. Our responsibility
as Baha'is is to make this case proactively, rather than hope for this belated recognition by a
society that for the most part accepts us, primarily as an acceptable alternative spiritual path 
for someone else. This post is too long, so I'll have to make the case elsewhere. The fact that we
have a low birth rate _in itself_ does not concern me. What does concern me is common misdiagnoses of the
low birth rate bespeaks a society that is too distracted with its own materialistic
concerns to solve even straightforward problems.
