## VR Makes Me Sick
So: every time I turn on the TV there seems to be some commercial for a
~broadband provider~ cable company where some idiots are walking around with
META VR headsets on. This is supposed to be the future.

It makes me sick. And it will make you sick too, almost certainly:

Are you the sort of person who is a two-beer johnny and still gets car sickness
in middle age? Just try VR the next time you want to induce vomiting.

In my early PhD research in the mid-nineties, I looked at a field that seemed to
be the new hotness. Not the internet, no, that might've made me successful. I
looked at something with more hype: Virtual Reality. At the time, a "graphics supercomputer"
might do several ten thousand tesselated triangles a frame - an actual supercomputer,
that is, a six-figure machine. So of course VR was both very expensive and very crude.

Even at the time, they had identified a potential deal-killer: motion-sickness.
The applications had a noticeable, perceptible lag. If you swung your head around
really fast, you'd easily notice it - the screen would seem to freeze a split second as
the computer caught up. And generally there was a lag in the tens to hundreds of
milliseconds. This caused an obvious disconnect between what your body felt and your eyes
saw, leading to motion-sickness. This was even the case when you were looking at obviously
artificial images then, which were, for comparison, less realistic than today's cheap Minecraft clone. 
Most people couldn't use it a few minutes before they got sick.

We have much better graphics now, but motion-sickness is still a problem, particularly for
the consumer-grade applications. As graphics have gotten more powerful, the promoters of
VR have leveraged that to force the price point down. So now you can get a headset that
costs hundreds, rather than hundreds of thousands, but the tradeoff is you still have a lag
only somewhat better than those early, nausea-inducing systems.

Do expensive, high-end systems have the same problem? Perhaps they've eliminated it
at that end, I don't know. But are you going to pay for it?

This leads to the other problem, which will make you sick if you're an investor or
an engineer looking at job opportunities. _No compelling use cases_. In the nineties
I terminated my research because the technology wasn't ready.
But when I circled back a few years later, I talked to a researcher who stayed in VR,
and he ran into a different problem: nobody could come up with anything terribly
compelling for the technology. There was no "killer app" to drive research
funding. And the field had seen plenty of hype
and attention. At the very high end, researchers were looking at
immersive simulations for training and medical
therapies, but other than that, one was stuck with video games. Indeed, there was
nothing that could just as effectively be done using some other technique, more cheaply.
That researcher finally pivoted to "augmented reality" (AR), which seemed
promising. However, AR didn't catch on in the first wave of commercialization (remember Google
Glass?). It's 2022 and the field still awaits its killer app.

VR appears to be a "push" technology. There's no consumer "pull," so companies looking
to make a buck have to push it at you. If you're a gamer,
have fun. But if you're an investor, maybe sit this one out.
