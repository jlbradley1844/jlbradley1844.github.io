## Materialism, Revisited
As a Baha'i, generally, one is concerned about love, justice and unity. And we believe
that indeed, this is what animates all religions. Others may disagree, but this is our
belief. Depending on the culture, the incompatibilities are going to vary.

If you review the more recent Baha'i writings - particularly the more recent letters
from our Universal House of Justice, they have already what the particular problem with
"the West" is, specifically the version refined in the United States. These center around:
* Materialism,
* Individualism, and
* Racism.

Of these, racism is already acknowledged as a social wrong, so let's skip over that. As
far as individualism, it is clear from the writings that what is meant is a certain sort
of libertarian attitude that says "I am not my brother's keeper," one where people are felt
to have no responsibilities at all to humanity as a whole. As individualistic as most
Americans are, my guess this is still not an attitude that many hold. So broadly, both
racism and excessive individualism would be recognized by Americans as generally bad things, whether
one regards them as collective evils or simply as personal failings.

Materialism, on the other hand, is more deeply embedded. And one may rightly ask just what
sort of "materialism" is condemned by the Baha'i writings. This is because there
are two meanings to materialism:
* Philosophical: the belief that everything that exists is material and can be studied
by scientific properties.
* Perjorative: one who is overly-concerned about owning things, particularly signifiers
of status, such as large estates and expensive clothing, and is prone to overconsumption.

If one is talking about the latter, then here again, most Americans would also agree with
Baha'is that this represents a personal failing worth fixing. Unfortunately, its elimination
is a bit of an uphill battle because consumerism - the glorification of material consumption -
is unavoidabley embedded in American society due to the many channels of media that
glorify it, thanks to their dependence on commercial sponsorship. Sometimes it's
hard to tell the difference between the content and the commercials. You can probably
think of people who are hooked on TV shows and YouTube channels dedicated
to celebrating the lifestyles of hedonistic celebrities, celebrities whose only marketable skill is
conspicuous consumption taken over a series of
extremely expensive vacations. Some of the viewers keep viewing even
knowing the fact that most of those expensive things and vacations are placed in the
show by undisclosed commercial sponsers wanting to push the hunger for these items on the viewers...

Still, just as most Americans seem baffled by the values of a relative they'd regard
as a hardened racist, they're also slightly bewildered by the values of people
who are eager viewers of those glorifying the lifestyles of excessive
consumption. So I think most Americans would agree with the
Baha'is on this.

So when Baha'i authorities are condemning materialism, they're talking about materialism
in the perjorative sense that I use above, not in the philosophical sense. Right?

Well it's not quite lopsided one way or another. Obviously the perjorative sense is
bad, as a greedy, acquisitive materialism would seem the very opposite of spirituality:

>  Mankind is submerged in the sea of materialism and occupied with the affairs
>  of this world. They have no thought beyond earthly possessions and manifest
>  no desire save the passions of this fleeting, mortal existence. Their utmost
>  purpose is the attainment of material livelihood, physical comforts and
>  worldly enjoyments such as constitute the happiness of the animal world
>  rather than the world of man.
>                (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 335)

>  If the people of the world persist, as they seem to be doing, in their blind
>  materialism, they must bear the consequences in a prolongation of their
>  present condition, and even a worsening of it.
>       (Shoghi Effendi, The Unfolding Destiny of the British Baha'i Community, p. 447)

But hold my non-alcoholic beer while I show something. The Baha'i writings 
also seem uniformly unwelcoming of materialistic _philosophy_.

>  Consider to what a remarkable extent the spirituality of people has been
>  overcome by materialism so that spiritual susceptibility seems to have
>  vanished, divine civilization become decadent, and guidance and knowledge of
>  God no longer remain. All are submerged in the sea of materialism. Although
>  some attend churches and temples of worship and devotion, it is in
>  accordance with the traditions and imitations of their fathers and not for
>  the investigation of reality.
>             (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 221)

>  In cities like New York the people are submerged in the sea of materialism.
>  Their sensibilities are attuned to material forces, their perceptions purely
>  physical. The animal energies predominate in their activities; all their
>  thoughts are directed to material things; day and night they are devoted to
>  the attractions of this world, without aspiration beyond the life that is
>  vanishing and mortal. In schools and temples of learning knowledge of the
>  sciences acquired is based upon material observations only; there is no
>  realization of Divinity in their methods and conclusions -- all have
>  reference to the world of matter. They are not interested in attaining
>  knowledge of the mysteries of God or understanding the secrets of the
>  heavenly Kingdom; what they acquire is based altogether upon visible and
>  tangible evidences.
>      (Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 261)

And get downright picky about it nowadays when talking about the academic realm:

>  Some of the protagonists in the discussions on the Internet have implied
>  that the only way to attain a true understanding of historical events and of
>  the purport of the sacred and historical records of the Cause of God is
>  through the rigid application of methods narrowly defined in a materialistic
>  framework. They have even gone so far as to stigmatize whoever proposes a
>  variation of these methods as wishing to obscure the truth rather than
>  unveil it.
>     (The Universal House of Justice, 1998 Feb 08, Materialistic Elements in Academic Scholarship, p. 4)

> Although the reality of God's continuous relationship with His creation and His
> intervention in human life and history are the very essence of the teachings of
> the Founders of the revealed religions, dogmatic materialism today insists that
> even the nature of religion itself can be adequately understood only through
> the use of an academic methodology designed to ignore the truths that make
> religion what it is.
>     (The Universal House of Justice, 1999 Apr 07, Issues Related to the Study of the Baha'i Faith)

While those of you who may lean towards conservative religious viewpoints may be
nodding your head in agreement, most in my circle would be a little bewildered
by this. After all, many of them express skepticism in a spirit world and they have
no problem behaving morally. As long as people behave ethically and think of others,
what's the problem?

I've written elsewhere that many of my agnostic-leaning friends, in spite of their
asserted materialism, are in fact "God-fearing atheists" gifted with good upbringing
and a natural inclination toward goodness, and on some subconscious level, they
are acting on beliefs of Justice, Goodness and Righteousness that however much
they believe otherwise, are entities that simply cannot be defined in the material sense.
In Baha'i parlance, these are _spiritual_ entities. As in, not material.
If you believe in moral reals (that is, that there is such a thing as right and wrong),
you've already taken a half-step into spiritual belief and a belief in a metaphysical,
unproven thing. 

Generally, materialists are quite unhappy with such arguments. They are, by definition,
almost entirely atheistic, and atheists are quite used to defending the fact they have
morals. Their counterattacks generally involve another variant of the "God is nonsense"
variety, and having run through their crowd-pleasing repatory, they might eventually
admit they believe ethics and moral reals are just sentimental nonsense, but the fact
they are sentimental nonsense does not prevent their compliance, because of <reasons>. This does not
bother me in the least; I'm quite happy for <reasons>, because the world would be a
horrible place if materialists act like the animals they claim they are.
But let's leave that aside for now, and grant the materialist that there is nothing
in their philosophy that prevents one from having good ethics; it is certainly the
case many materialists have good ethics, just as it is certainly the case that many
of the religious, for all their protestations, have horrid ethics.

But that is not what is being argued. The question is, is the _promulgation_ of
materialism a problem?

There is one phrase Baha'u'llah used repeatedly in his writings to others who asked
him confounding philosophical questions:

>  Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and centre your
>  deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.
>          (Baha'u'llah, Tabernacle of Unity)

I find it interesting that this was used, not in discussions about collective governance,
where this obviously makes sense, but about philosophical directions. Baha'u'llah is
asking not just Baha'is, but everyone who gives him a hearing, to apply this to the
criterion of philosophical thought.
The question a Baha'i might ask, therefore, is, do materialistic (or physicalist, if you're
being more contemporary) philosophies serve the present concerns of this day and age? 

I believe they do not. This would be true even if I were a believer in ostensibly
materialistic-compatible religions such as Bhuddism (the American variant).

--------------------------------------------------

To justify this, I'm going to pose a claim agreed to by a number of philosophers, one
which many a "lay philosopher" may find shocking and objectionable. That is the
following:

> There is no _one true philosophy_ that properly explains all of reality.

This, far from being novel, is bandied about a fair bit in philosophical circles. I can
think of two philosophers in particular who were responsible for this shift. There is Wittgenstein's
latter work, where he appealed to curtail the "world-building" nature of many philosophical
schools, and attempted to refocus philosophy on the careful use of language and clarification
of thought. And there is Richard Rorty's work, in which he claims that there is no
eye of God or priveleged viewpoint from which a philosopher can paint One True Picture
of the world, and that grand philosophies do more harm than good. Throw in a dash of
Popperien skepticism and you have a picture of a philosophy which is too humbled by
its own history to ever definitively claim a priveleged view of truth. This does _not_
mean philosophy has given up its search for truth! but it does mean that the field has
become deeply skeptical of The Truth, as claimed by any unifying framework - around
science, around logic, around freedom, creed or indeed any animus.

For an American or British reader who reads primarily popular-selling philosophy, this
would seem like a defeated viewpoint, or the viewpoint of a sore loser. This is only
the case because by the late twentieth century, materialism had come to so dominate
popular philosophy that it was seen as the only valid viewpoint. While this may be
true in the Barnes & Noble philosophy section, and inside the classroom of That One
Philosophy Professor who actually teaches 101 instead of letting the TA do it, it isn't
true of the entire field of contemporary philosophy, particular if you include writings
in other languages. Materialism came to dominate American philosophy thanks to a combination
of charismatic popularizers, commercial and political interests, and a (perhaps rightly)
aggrieved atheistic minority who came to think of the field as their rightful home.
However, there are plenty of atheistic immaterialistic philosophers. Unfortunately,
they don't sell nearly so well as certain writers that are not only atheistic, but tell people
what they want to hear, in the form of tales of amoral ubermensch of innate greatness
who take what they want from life, living freely above
the rules and urinating down on the little people.

That in itself should tell you that philosophy is not the neutral, unbiased search
for The Truth, if there ever was one. I have no doubt that the bulk of philosophers love
truth and hate nonsense. I also suspect that in their day-to-day life, they are mostly
decent people even if their philosophies tell them to do otherwise. But unfortunately,
there is no such thing as an unbiased observer. We are all seekers in this world, and
unfortunately where we land depends upon which direction we were headed in the first place.
Our notion of the truth may be rigorous and well-reason, but it will be astonishingly
incomplete depending upon the path we took to get there. I've long suspected that some (not
all) libertarian philosophers were motivated in their philosophical study searching for
justifications for doing
things they wanted to do that others did not approve of. In my case, my motivation is
equally simple; I grew up clueless and easily bullied, and my considered belief is that
there are too many *sshol*s in the word, and the world I want
to build is one that renders them as powerless as possible. We could both have rigorous,
well-reason pictures of the world and still violently disagree with each other.

What is less examined is the notion that, with a number of competing pictures of reality,
some pictures may be more morally compelling than others. This fact has gotten lost in the shuffle.
In between the post-truth pronouncements of continental philosophers and the repurposing
of philosophy as just a mechanism for rigorous argumentation, people forget the things
that led to this pass were primarily ethical in consideration - the fact that philosophy,
for all its professed search for the truth and the good, failed to prevent the horrors
of facism, naziism and Stalinism in the mid-twentieth century. Indeed, all of these
movements had their own philosophies, cherry-picked from the writings of philosophers
such as Niezche, Heidegger, Marx and the grand world-builder himself, Hegel. While
most philosophers would've said that the fix for this would've been better philosophy,
the trouble is, most individuals looking for a philosophy cannot be bothered.

I suspect that anyone who writes philosophy wants, above all, to be influential. "Success"
in philosophy can generally mean, at best, a tenured position with occasional speaking
fees that will produce a middle-class lifestyle at best; people who are bright enough
to do that have other more lucrative options, so plainly the motivation is something
other than money or status.
If a philosophy is to be good, if it is to be influential, then it must be capable of
being studied and understood by educated laypersons. So, for instance, if one tuned into
_The Good Place_, one was occasionally treated to ideas from philosophy that were both
contemporary and understandable, and my understanding is the philosophy community was more than
happy to assist the scriptwriters and showrunners trying to get 
the details right. So if you do philosophy, and you
do want to influence people, then you are making a moral choice, just as you would 
whenever you set out to influence people. As a philosopher you hope that it's good, or
at least, truthful. At the very least, you don't wish to put out something so incoherent
you embarass yourself, or so easily misused for evil that your name lives on in disrepute.

So what does this have to do with materialism? Well, when someone thinks in terms of
materialism _as a philosophy_ they will think in terms of Truth and Matter and Science.
One will think of verificationism - that is, no truths asserted that cannot be tested.
One will think in terms of experiments, and limits of truth, and avoidance of metaphysics.
These things are all fine as far as hard philosophy.

By beef with materialism is that's not what people hear, and that's not what people
pick up on. Instead, what materialism has done is spawned a host of "lay philosophies,"
or popular philosophies as you will, that have made their way into the culture.
My gripe is entirely with those.

And that's why I revisit the quote from Baha'u'llah: "Be anxiously concerned with
the needs of the age ye live in, and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and 
requirements." Many popularizers of materialism as a philosophy have put this message
out into this world without thought of any benefit other than "serving the truth."
But the primary benifit they seem to have is to weaken religous belief, as if
that in itself is sufficient to guarantee improved morals and happiness of followers. 
While I agree (as does the Baha'i Faith) that mindless faith and fanaticism have
done more harm then good, popularizers act as if their works weaken religious faith
_uniformly_, in both the thoughtfully devout and the harmfully fanatical. 
They do not. More likely, they convince mainly the wavering, those who have little natural
religious inclination. And if anything, they make the fanatic
even more fanatical. Any claim of improved morality due to a lessening of religious
faith is unexamined.

Here's a statement about the materialist "lay philosophy" that is generally accepted
as universally true in secular societies:

>  ... materialism emerged full-blown in 
>  the second half of the twentieth century as a kind of universal religion
>  claiming absolute authority in both the personal and social life of humankind.
>  Its creed was simplicity itself. Reality — including human reality and the
>  process by which it evolves — is essentially material in nature. The goal of
>  human life is, or ought to be, the satisfaction of material needs and wants.
>  Society exists to facilitate this quest, and the collective concern of
>  humankind should be an ongoing refinement of the system, aimed at rendering it
>  ever more efficient in carrying out its assigned task.

>  With the collapse of the Soviet Union, impulses to devise and promote any formal materialistic 
>  belief system disappeared. Nor would any useful purpose have been served by such efforts, as 
>  materialism was soon facing no significant challenge in most parts of the world. Religion, where not 
>  simply driven back into fanaticism and unthinking rejection of progress, became progressively 
>  reduced to a kind of personal preference, a predilection, a pursuit designed to satisfy spiritual and 
>  emotional needs of the individual.

A materialist philosopher may say this has nothing to do with _materialism_, as he or she
defines it, per se. Yet this mostly correctly states the resulting world-view. 
Whereas secularism once sought
to allow the workings of people of many creeds together by limiting the potential for conflict
on that plane, materialism, as a world view, has addressed this by simply yanking out all
immaterial considerations, under the presumption that people are free to believe whatever nonsense
they want, but _it's still just basically nonsense_.

That quote above is not from an academic or secular authority; it's from _Century of Light_, a statement on twentieth
century history written under the auspices of the supreme Baha'i religious authorities. As you might
guess, the main problem they have with materialism is its essentially religious in nature:

>  Whether as world-view or simple appetite, materialism’s effect is to leach out of human 
>  motivation — and even interest — the spiritual impulses that distinguish the rational soul. “For self-love,” 
>  ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá has said, “is kneaded into the very clay of man, and it is not possible that, 
>  without any hope of a substantial reward, he should neglect his own present material good.” In 
>  the absence of conviction about the spiritual nature of reality and the fulfilment it alone offers, it is 
>  not surprising to find at the very heart of the current crisis of civilization a cult of individualism that 
>  increasingly admits of no restraint and that elevates acquisition and personal advancement to the 
>  status of major cultural values

The problem I have with materialism as a philosophy is more pragmatic. As it has no
answer to the question "what else is there?", and indeed discourages even answering such
questions, it cultivates an incuriosity about our purpose and ethics. The most
most common personal philosophy based on it is what I'd refer to as Eric Cartman Materialism:

>  The goal of my
>  human life is, or ought to be, the satisfaction of my material needs and wants.
>  Society exists to facilitate my quest, and the collective concern of
>  humankind should be an ongoing refinement of a system serving me, aimed at rendering it
>  ever more efficient in funneling money and pleasure to me.

>  Oh, and everyone I don't like can just eat it and die.

I'm not expert at philosophy, but I know there is more to materialism than this. But for those who
like the topline takeaway, it's very easy to ignore the footnotes and take from it only what you want.

--------------------------------

Philosophies exist and will be popularized. The popularizers of materialism have nary been concerned
about the spread of such folk philosophies - nay, they interpret it as the rest of the world
finally coming around to their viewpoint. The fact that many of these are scurrilous
is of little concern - "the truth must be served, after all." Unfortunately, the original
philosophical materialists are lying in the dust with worms, unable to defend their
philosophies from misuse. Meanwhile a new generation of
philosophers have to wrangle with problems of a moral nature that actually cause real
problems in society - problems involving failure of collective governance and a host
of moral concerns. Unfortunately,
while materialists may point to a host of ethical solutions within a secular
framework, the lay philosophies have generally ben hostile to bolting on ethics onto the
materialistic framework - because they
are noncompelling, nonobvious and generally seen as impediments to getting what one
wants. Thoughtful philosophers have come back to the need for the unifying forces
of religion, or at least "spirituality," as needing to hold society together, while
acknowledging wistfully that after having "killed God" and "killed truth," there is
no reason to expect a mass movement to turn in that direction. So recommendations are
generally couched in the fashion of "Wouldn't it be nice if..."

The solution, in my mind, is fairly obvious. Philosophers, particularly those of a materialist
nature, must acknowledge that their philosophy is _by design_ a limited philosophy.
It may even be unsuitable as a lay philosophy around which to map one's life. 
It is extremely difficult to extract ethics from a materialistic framework, but
that does not mean it does not exist. This fact seems entirely missing in the pop-culture version. If the
world-building idealism of Hegel and the ancient musings of Plato is somehow responsible
for the horrible fascist movements of the twentieth century, as is insisted by
certain skeptics of immaterialist philosophies, then surely the
doctrinaire, exclusionary materialist skepticism of the last three hundred years is just
as responsible for the growth of libertarian creeds that hold no moral creed other
than "Do what thou wilt, so long as thou hast cash in hand" and happily hold notions
such as rule of law and participative democracy as expendible notions to be trashed
the minute it gets in one's way. Materialistic philosophies do not excuse such moral
shortcuts, and materialist popularizers in agreement with that sentiment
should spend more time convincing their readers why that is,
even if their readers would rather consume fluffly light reads where smart people dunk on religious
true-believers. Meanwhile, those philosophers who do not hold to
an exclusionary physicalist view of reality must more assertively provide compelling 
reasons for their alternative views, and particularly focus on the pragmatic aspects
of philosophy, particular as it relates to ethics, the _polis_ and human values and
happiness, where materialism seems to have done the most damage to society.
