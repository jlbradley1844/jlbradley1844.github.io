## It's Too Late to Rescue The Old Order from The FAANG Effect

One of the hot news items in the business press has been the sudden rounds
of layoffs at top-tier technology companies. I imagine some of this news coverage is
driven by a bit too much eagerness at the thought of coveted, highly-paid
engineers being laid off en masse. Many of the more measured press stories
have taken a step back, and pointed out that considering the overall tight labor
market, the laid off engineers will
probably do well, given the pressing shortage most other companies have
in finding skilled labor, and the end result is probably going to be a
more productive economy with a few people taking modest pay cuts for
doing more "useful" work. In any event, the effect of these layoffs - which
frankly, is a drop in the bucket compared to the number of job openings
for software engineers - is going to be quite modest, but may actually be
positive. Maybe this is me being self-centered, being
that I don't work for a FAANG, but I tend to agree. I've told myself I could
probably get a job at one of those companies if
I got off my lazy butt and prepped for the interviews, but I have
have a hard time justifying to myself how I'd
be spending my days in Meta or some other "attention-economy" company.

However, if you are one of those people who have spent the past decades
waiting for something that was going to put the engineers "back in their
place," and have been dreaming of a correction that will lower engineering
salaries to what you think they're worth (i.e., less than you) well... not
gonna happen. At one time, software developers were considered solidly
middle class - as in, **not** upper-middle class. I'm afraid those days are
gone. I believe the FAANG effect has effected a permanent "anchoring" effect
in the job market. Don't expect engineering talent to revert to middle-tier
wages, uh, ever.

Here's a tale from thirty years ago. Set the clock back to 1992. If I went 
to a gas station, a quickie-mart
or a McD's, and got a coffee, I knew two things about it:
1. It would be terrible.
2. It would be less than a dollar.
If I wanted decent coffee, I had to make it myself. If you had a coffee shop,
you might get something good, but that was a splurge, and nobody made a habit of it.
"Two bucks for a cup of coffee?" shrieks the midwesterner. This was back when a
good deli sandwhich might cost you three dollars. It seemed insane.

You know what happened: in the mid-nineties, North America was paved with Starbucks,
and within a few years,
the coffee everywhere was suddenly very good... and also three times more expensive. 
When restaurants and gas stations saw Starbucks making actual money, they did the obvious;
they improved their coffee, and they the raised the prices, so they were maybe
a quarter less than the Starbucks. Suddenly, everyone thought coffee was supposed
to be more than a buck, and two bucks seemed defensible. Why? Because people decided
they were willing to pay up, if they felt they wanted it enough.

What does that have to do with FAANG? Let me tell you of a time long ago,
when I first graduated and worked in engineering and computer science. Early nineties,
when coffee was still bad.

In those days, engineering, software development, and general "STEM" staff was considered
white collar encumberances on business, much like the accountants in payroll.
Even in technology companies, the people regarded as "value creators" all had MBAs 
or were in sales, and the pay scales reflected
that accordingly. Engineering was a _cost center_, an unavoidable overhead,
and corporate acted as if you were lucky to earn a paycheck at all. After all,
every year it looked more and more realistic to replace you with an outsourced
Indian in Pune for fifteen percent of your salary. Remember
the white collar plebes in 1999's _Office Space_? They were software engineers, and
anyone who was a software engineer back in those days will attest to how
painfully *accurate* that movie was - right down to the guy who earned more selling
magazine subscriptions than programming for a living.

Indeed, in spite of the dot-com boom, if you were a college incoming freshman
entering school in 2000, there was plenty of contrarian 
"smart money" advice to _avoid_ software development
or engineering. Thomas Friedman aside - his kids weren't going into software
engineering, were they? - engineering was a chump move. All that 
work was going to India, we were told, and even if you were lucky enough
to keep your job, you would be on the bottom of the totem pole, since you would
never be in a position to contribute any revenue. Best to get an MBA and get
used to funny time zones so you could prepare for a life of ordering
your remotely-based plebes around.

Of course, that was all talk, even then;
the actual reports I heard from those same advice-giving businesspeople was that in spite of all 
the talk of outsourcing and layoffs, they still relied critically on in-house engineering talent 
and it was still mighty hard to find. Some businesspeople actually seemed indignant;
I recall a friend of a friend telling me "What are these senior engineers doing asking for 
over 100K a year? With all of this outsourcing, they're lucking to be making 80K a year!!"
This from a consultant who described his 200K/year salary as "barely middle class." 
I wasted no time pointing out that 
anyone talented enough to be employed as a senior engineer would have no
time finding lucrative employment _outside_ engineering should their pay fall beneath the level
they feel sufficient. Perhaps by taking the jobs of expensive management consultants.

By the early 2000s I had shifted into working for startups, and I had resolved
to never again work in a company where engineering was thought of as a "cost center." Many of the
jobs were stinky, and one of the companies turned out to have shady accounting. But
they were better than the jobs I had in the nineties. At
no time was I ever made to feel like I worked in a "cost center." Those companies depended
on their engineers, and they knew it. Their pay was competitive, 
if not great, it was obvious from their
financials that they paid what they could, and engineering heads had near-veto over
everthing the company did. When outsourcing was discussed, it was 
done _by engineers_ to address coverage gaps in
the least valuable parts of their business, and was clearly targeted at freeing up
engineering to follow up on more valuable tasks, not as a way to reduce headcount.

So about these FAANG engineers, who are just hitting the labor market: they'll find a
labor market much changed from the last tech bust. It will not be a bust for them.
Your company may be one of those who have been suffering
in the tight labor market, with important initiatives languishing due to lack of
engineering talent. If you want one of these engineers, you may not need to pay them
as well as they're used to; you probably can't. Besides, they're smart, 
and they know your company may not afford
FAANG salaries. But if you want to hire them, the phrase "cost center" has to exit your
vocabulary. These are people who are used to knowing that the company depends on
their contribution - and indeed, their contribution _drives_ revenue. Just like the fifty-cent
cup of coffee from days of yore, the 80K/year "worker bee" programmer who is grateful 
to just have a job, follow orders, keep his or her head down and STFU, is a thing 
of the past. And if you really
can't find a way to make your engineering organization a competitive advantage, a
revenue driver instead of a cost center, well... do you know you can hire engineering
staffing remotely in India?

I suppose if you're a FAANG engineer, or if you're among thouse getting those sorts
of wages, any adjustment will be a letdown. And if you mistook
the lopsided salaries as a sign of a "new normal" that reflected a
merocratic, "natural aristocracy" of talent that would place you at the
top forever, this should be a valuable corrective.
Any older engineers knew better;
up until the dot-com era, engineering salaries typically followed boom/bust
cycles, and that day may return. But the busts will never be enough
to drive down salaries enough for some people.

And as to self-regarding "value creators" that eagerly look forward
to a sizeable, across-the-board downward adjustments to 
the salaries of those "overpaid engineers": they will
likely be disappointed again. Just as they were disappointed the threats of mass outsourcing
failed to push down salaries. To this end, I generally don't cross-post, but the
following blog article was just too on-the-spot to pass up:

There is nothing that reeks so badly as working for people who honestly
believe the following:

    As business-owners, we deserve access to cheap expert labor.

If you're amoung the true-believers in this notion, who have been waiting for the 
party to start for twenty years... keep waiting. The FAANG layoffs are too little
and too late to help you.
