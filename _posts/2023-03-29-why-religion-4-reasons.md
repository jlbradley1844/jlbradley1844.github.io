## Four Valid Explanations of Religious Faith
Why are people religious?

It's a valid question. In spite of increasing secularism, people continue to devote significant time
to religion; in most cases, they receive no material benefit.

To listen to atheists, the typical story is that
religion only exists as an explanation for the natural world, myths and tales about
why the world is the way it is that have naturally died off as scientific explanations have replaced them.
Religious believers, then, are no better than flat-earthers in that they believe obviously fictitious explanations
of the universe.

While this may explain religion for atheists, it says little about the believers.
Do you know religious people? I would
wager none of them are religious for this reason. Such reasoning reminds me
of the increasing partisan rancor in this contry, in that most partisans believe things about the others
that are speculative, fantastic and outright fictitious. The athestic insistence of religion as a scientific
explanation is just as fictitions as your angry uncle's belief that the members of the other party run
child pedophile rings and perform satanic rituals.

Some other more sophisticated secular explanations, admitting that perhaps there is a practical benifit,
have used explanations such as group membership, social capital, and vague notions of personal fulfillment.
Others have blamed it entirely on upbringing, indoctrination or misplaced loyalty. The most novel explanation
is the claim it is a "meme" - a viral idea - one that propagates based on its ability to propagate rather
than for any possible beneficial reason.

All the while overlooking explanations for religion that are actually religious in nature.

Being a Baha'i, I have an framework I find far more compelling, as it comes straight from the writings
of the founder of my own
religion. Baha'u'ullah, the founder of the Baha'i Faith, penned a short
writing called "The Four Valleys" that explains the motives for religious belief. 
This was a letter to a Sufi in which he explained that there were
four metaphorical "valleys" that "true seekers" of religious wandered throughout, each one of which
being a particular mindset that caused the search for religious fulfillment. Unfortunately, for those 
looking for simple explanations, his language is couched in Sufi terminology and allusions to 
works well known within that subculture, making the writing
unapproachable for someone not educated in the language. However, there is a consensus among Baha'i
scholars of what these four paths mean. To me, this writing details four distinct, legitimate reasons 
or motives for following a religous path.

As Baha'u'llah himself introduces his subject:

> They that seek to ascend to the heaven of mystic wayfaring are of four
> kinds only. I shall describe them in brief, that the signs and degrees of each may become plain and
> manifest to thee.

A warning before I begin: these explanations in my words are my personal interpretations and my interpretations
only! No Baha'i may put forward their interpreptations of religious truth as definitive.
In particular, both the frming and the titles of each path are mine invention only.

1. SELF-DISCIPLINE AND MORAL CODE

This is the first path outlined by Baha'u'llah; the "first valley," if you will:

> If the wayfarers be among them that seek after THE SANCTUARY OF THE DESIRED ONE, this plane
> pertaineth to the self — but the self which is intended is “the Self of God that pervadeth all His
> laws”. In this station the self is not rejected but beloved; it is regarded with favour and is not to
> be shunned.

Truthfully, a fair number of religious people follow this religious path. They are looking for a
source of guidance or self-discipline; a way of life, as it were. As far as _why_ they need it, 
if you have to ask, you are indeed lucky or
naturally born with good habits. Everyone has little rules they have for themselves for their own
benefit; health, ethical, or otherwise, even the most libertine of us has lines they will not
cross, even if just for their own benefit. "Red meat only once a week." "Three is my limit!"
"No coffee after two PM" "No sleeping with the ex!" 

It is absolutely legitimate to look to the guidance of religion for guidance on self-betterment.
A lot of hardcore "individualists" look down on religious creeds - yet they themselves have no problem
picking up advice from other people. Some may even pick up meditation and Buddhism, under the guise that
somehow Buddhism isn't a "real religion," and is therefore "haram" (lawful) to right-minded Free Thinkers.

It is said that experience is learning from your own mistakes, while wisdom is learning from the
mistakes of others. Perhaps those who look for religious paths for guidance are not simply lemmings,
but are instead excercising wisdom?

2. SEARCH FOR PHILOSOPHICAL TRUTH

The second valley outlined by Baha'u'llah is those who follow religions in search of greater truths:

> If the wayfarers be among them that dwell in THE COURT OF THE ALL-PRAISED, this is the station of
> the Intellect, which is known as the messenger of the realm of the body and the most great pillar.
> That which is intended, however, is the universal divine Intellect, whose sovereignty fostereth the
> growth of all things, and not every vain and feeble mind.

If one went back a mere century ago, one still find a fair bit of philosophy that dealt with
questions such as purpose, meaning, a number of other things. Indeed, just over one hundred years
ago, many philosophers considered themselves idealists, rather than materialist.
Unfortunately, the materialist and analytic turns in philosophy made even asking such questions
unthinkably unfashionable. Popperian skepticism and scientific reductionism demanded that the
only "valid questions" be those that when posed, could be answered using the tools of science
and logic. Anything else was meaningless.

Philosophy doesn't stand still, and there are signs that if people haven't disproven scientific
reductionism, they've at least gotten a bit bored with it. Meanwhile, lay philosophers and
lay theologians will continue to look for purpose and meaning, however much materialists may
tell them there is no such thing.

Curiousity about these things will not die off, no matter
how often someone tells you "that question is meaningless because it isn't testable." Eventually,
it begins to look like the answerer don't have an answer and is just embarassed to admit they don't
have one. And people certainly won't stop asking just because someone gets offended
at their curiosity.

Some people think religion gives people answers, but it's more accurate to say that religion
supports one search for answers. Such people are drawn to religion because they are curious,
and even if religion doesn't give you certain answers, at least it allows you pose the questions!

3. LOVE AND FELLOWSHIP

There is a certain sort of religious believer that believes that the heart of every religion
is a message of love.

> If the lovers be among them that abide within the precincts of THE ABODE OF THE 
> LODESTONE OF HEARTS, no soul may dwell on this kingly throne save the countenance of 
> love... This plane demandeth pure love and unalloyed affection.

This seems to infuriate both those that believe religion is evil, and those
that believe _those other relgions_ are all evil. All the same, there are those who believe
in love, and religious fellowship is the closest thing to be had.

Baha'u'llah alludes to the path of the Sufis in this valley - wandering spirits in search
of the Love of God. But there is a plainer side to this path, one that enjoys religion for
the sense of fellowship and brotherly love that abides in communities of Faith.

For such people, denunciations of the evil of religions are going to seem hollow.
There are very few opponents of religion that seek to offer alternatives to religious community.
Indeed, when one compares this against strict materialism, someone motivated by love
will see very little of what one likes.

4. FOLLOWING THE PATH OF THE PROPHET

Finally there are those who follow religion as a means to find "the straight path" in life;
more often than not, through following the teachings or example of a prophet or religious
founder.

> If the mystic knowers be among them that have attained THE BEAUTY OF THE BELOVED, this station
> is the throne of the inmost heart and the secret of divine guidance. This is the seat of the mystery
> “He doeth what He willeth, and ordaineth what He pleaseth.”

This is the path of absolute devotion to a prophet. In following a prophet, the follower views this person
as the exemplar of an extrordinary spiritual life. Naturally, such a person must exhibit flawless
ethical character; the example of their character is generally the first thing that draws the believer.

Baha'u'llah writes most at length about this path, and in the most inspiring manner:

> Abiding in the court of rapture, the dwellers of this mansion wield with utmost joy and
> gladness the sceptres of divinity and lordship; and, established upon the lofty seats of justice, they
> exert their rule and bestow upon every soul its due. 

The followers of this path are noted for their devotion, ardor, and attachment to what
they regard as the source of divine guidance. 

To me, while the believers of the other three valleys could be said to follow any number of particular
religious paths, loose or strict, mystical or practically secular, this path differs. People of this sort
are attracted specifically to a specific religious path, and follow it with a zeal that can reform societies.
Baha'u'llah imputes the best motives to the residents of these valleys, and all are regarded
as pure seekers. It does seem he regards the final valley is the most enlightened. 

Baha'i academics have
interpreted the particulars of these metaphoric "valleys" in different ways. 
Some envision a path of a true seeker through these
valleys; others believe they spell out something like a Meyers-Briggs typology of religious
personalities, implying it is likely one stays in one's "valley" for a long time, perhaps
even a lifetime.

But the main reason I write about this is because these supply four _motives for belief_, motives
that the critics of religions generally overlook entirely. 

-------------------------------

So cast your eye back to the story I told at the beginning of this post - regarding people who
dislike members of one political party, all the while having no idea what people who hold 
opposing viewpoints actually believe. These four motives explain the attraction of religious
beliefs far better than anything a skeptic every wrote.
In their writings, motives for religious belief are automatically thought to arise from psychological
needs which, if not outright selfish, are at least morally neutral and are in no way meant to
imply the believer is superior to the nonbeliever. And so we have theories that people are
religious because it helps them reduce stress, by feeling the universe is more under control;
theories that religion is really about group membership, and the religious laws are ways to
signal committment to the group; speculation that it is a means for replacing missing parental figures. 
None of these will be recognized by actual religious believers; perhaps because they are not true.

Such skeptical theories are not meant to explain religious belief, so much as they are to
_explain away_ religious belief.

What do I believe, personally? To be blunt, I'm probably stuck in the first valley. I was raised
as a solid "social-justice Catholic," and when I tired of being embarassed by the writings of
certain "church leaders," I was determined to find a replacement that would continue to provide
a modicum of guidance and self-discipline. If this is the "least" of the four valleys, as some have
theorized, then so much for me.
