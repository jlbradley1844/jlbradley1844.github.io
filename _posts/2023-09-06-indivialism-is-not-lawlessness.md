## Individualism Is Not Lawlessness

As a long-time Baha'i and a longer-time follower of such civic movements as "communitiarianism," as well
as good-government movements, there is a distinction that is often elided. It allows people to excuse
behavior seen as "typically American," and the sorts of articles that seem to repeatedly justify "why we can't have
nice things in America"; no clean public transit, no decent public housing, no efficient government,
in short, none of the things that would make one of the wealthiest societies on earth look like the
wealthiest society on earth.

The culprit, it is often pinpointed, is *dunnn dunnn* individualism.

This is normally contrasted with "collectivisim." The cultures of those nicer countries are 
more collectivist, and
hence, more apt to cooperate in collective measures for betterment. Asian and European societies are
more collectivist so they have nicer infrastructure and better civic engagement. But, gee, they
aren't as individualist. As Americans, we want the freedom to do what we want and found businesses
and believe the creed of our choosing and speak freely, so of course we _must_ put up with trash 
in the street, panhandlers in public transit and lousy governance. Because,
of course, that is the flip side to individualism. You can have nice railroads and clean cities,
but if you get that, you have to give up freedom of speech and assembly and join the official church.

I object to this argument.
his line of reasoning always reminded me of similar weakly-posed arguments  
around poor governance in the US, that it is due to the "diversity" in American culture; it seemed
to be a proxy for tribalist (at best) scapegoating of disliked minorities.
The "argument from individualism" may seem somewhat less blameworthy.
However, the conclusion doesn't
necessarily follow from the premise, and when so people are happy to pretend that it does,
I often feel myself forced to figure out why that is the case.

I think the problem with these analyses is that they conflate two things that are assumed related
but are not:

**Individualism is not lawlessness, and lawlessness does not imply individualism.**

Let's look at these a little more closely. I understand using dictionary definitions is considered poor
form philosophically, but I'm not sure how else I'm supposed to clarify it.

    Individualism: a social theory favoring freedom of action for individuals over collective 
    or state control.

    Lawlessness: a state of disorder due to a disregard of the law.

These are not identical.
Of course, _potentially_, a culture that placed too much emphasis on individualism might fail to inculcate
the necessary attention to civic virtues, leading to an overall increase in lawlessness.
But in that case, the problem is still lawlessness itself, not individualism.

Nor does lessening individualism guarantee more lawful behavior. 
One can easily find countries thought of as "collectivist" (in
the sense of group oriented, not economically) where laws are flouted and actual civic
engagement is low. Lack of individualism implies in no way civic virtue or respect for the
rule of law.

Why am I bothered by the fact people usually confound these two things? It's because you can't solve
a problem if you can't name it, and if you give it the wrong name, your solutions are going to be
wildly off. This is true whether it's discussions among the Baha'i community, pop philosophy, religion
or popular culture

*In Baha'i culture,* the impact of such confusion is limited, since given our small size, we are
limited in our ability to impact cultural discoures. Still, to the extent we do impact it, many
Baha'is regard excessive individualism as the
root of a host of ills. And I tend to agree with them. But doing so without pointing out
related causes hides the fact that some balance of individualism is necessary.
Blaming excessive individualism is
not the same as saying all tenets of individualistic thought are wrong.

Indeed, Baha'i writings uphold key tenents of individualism that are generally rejected by
collective-oriented societies.
One of the key pillars of individualism is freedom of thought, and freedom to believe what you
wish. The Baha'i Faith is absolute in this regard. Authorities (particularly Baha'i authorities)
may in no way tell others what they must believe or sanction them for believing otherwise. The lone
exception here is parental authority regarding training of children (ending at fifteen). This
in no way implies absolute freedom of action, but it does depart from collectivist cultural
practices that restrict not only action but beliefs themselves. 

Indeed, sometimes this individualist streak comes as a surprise to Baha'is themselves.
For instance, I've heard Baha'is express surprise when authorities
counsel their communities to do nothing about nonconformist thought and behavior within the
community, or repeatedly cousel patience when faced with public flaunting of religious laws.
This surprice is likely because, in spite of our embrace of certain aspects of
individualism, Baha'i culture is extremely _lawful_ in orientation. I've noticed that
many Baha'is feel discomfort when they cannot comply with a law even when
they have good reason why they cannot (e.g. sickness during fasting). Likewise, Baha'is are often told 
repeatedly that they must be obedient
to civic authorities and their governments, even under under goverments
inimical Baha'i beliefs, as most authoritarian-leaning governemnts are. The respect for law
is so absolute that Baha'is have willingly curtailed their own administrative activities in
response to laws by governments well known as unjust even by their own people.

*Among the wider community,* my main concern here is 
what I think of as "pop philosophy"; certain half-backed
concepts that have circulated among the college-educated classes, 
as well as the long-form commentary of "serious" magazines and bloggers.
This idea that individualism prevents proper governance, intentional or not, serve to limit economic
and political discourse, forcing a libertarian viewpoint as the only defensible one.

The world *lawful* is a loaded term, so it is no surprise that these serious essayists don't
want to touch it. Writers like to be read, and most writers have learned that their readers
don't like to be lectured to. This can lead them to avoid moralizing of any sort, and writing
about certain tendencies in society as caused by "lawlessness" is indeed moralizing. Worse yet,
lawfulness as a term has been co-opted by the "law and order" crowd, who generally believe in
no laws or order that they themselves can't impose on other people.

But by avoiding this term, such writers confuse the issues. One may have an individualistic
society that is deeply lawful, just as one can have an anarchic society. When people long
for an America that values civic virtues, one that values clean government and the rule of
law, they are not asking to throw out individualism. They are not telling people to stop
practicing weird religions, expressing themselves civically and socialy, and stop founding
businesses. Indeed, there are many societies like that in the world. Telling them they can't
have these things Because Individualism is a mistruth used
to force people to accept a governmental culture that they have every reason to object to.

What Baha'is can bring to the table, aside from showing the necessity of avoiding excesses
of individualistic thought, is a broader awareness of _lawfulness_ and _respect for the rule
of law_ as shown in the Baha'i writings. The lawful behavior asked of believers
by the Baha'i writings includes things such as:

* The importance of not just personal virtues, but civic virtues;
* The avoidance of tribal identities and willingness to treat everyone in society as worthy of having an equal say;
* The avoidance of conflict and contention in civil society;
* The cultivation of a strong patriotism that balances strong local and national loyalties with a deserved respect for all people;
* The willingness to serve governments as disinterested citizens of the nation.

The proper guide for this is doubtless Abdu'l-Baha's writing, _The Secret of Divine Civilization_.
In it, he outlines the requirements not only for those who would lead, but those who would
serve governments as well as those whose only role is as a responsible citizen.
