## The Bitter Truth about Atheism
As the United States and Europe become more secular, the hope of the atheists was that this would
presage the coming of a better world order - one in which ethnic hatreds and tribalism would cease
and pseudoscientific nonsense disappears. It hasn't happened that way. It may turn out that healthy
religious practice is _necessary_ to sustain fact-based governments and peaceful societies.

When he was alive, one of my favorite media personalities was Carl Sagan. My formative teenage years were in
the late seventies and early eighties, and at the time, Carl Sagan seemed 
to me the very model of scientific knowledge, clarity
and wisdom. In his telling, a world without God was even more majestic as one with. I didn't take such
a message to heart; I was a good Catholic, and chalked his belief up to a sort of "spiritual deafness" on his
part. But thanks to examples such as him, I always had a hard time thinking of atheists as the sort of
in-person-antichrists that many of the religious warn us about. And over the course of my life, I confess I've
found very little _practical_ difference between the ethics of the religious and the nonreligious.
Certainly, I have many atheists in my pantheon of heroes, and many of the people whose beliefs I despised
claimed to be religious, even if it were the case that they used their religious 
faith not as a source of enlightenment, but as a sort of kevlar
to shield their behaviors from questioning.

While I have misgivings about atheism, my main concern is not the whole "not believing in God" thing. One term
I'd use for the Baha'i Faith as I personally interpret it is "apophatic" - we can't say what It is, we can
only say what It is not. So I'm more of a "God of the philosophers" person - the sort of believer that many
religious would say I might as well be atheist. Given that, I probably have more in common philosophically 
with committed
atheists then they are willing to admit. (As Baha'i authority Abdu'l-Baha is reported to have said to
an athesit, "We don't believe in the same God you don't believe in either.")

No, my main concern is the sort of triumphalism that atheistic idealists like Carl Sagan had. Their claim is
that religion is nothing but superstition; take religion from The Masses the Light of Science will enter their hearts.
The less relgious a society is, the more enlightened it is, and the more moral it will be. Were that truly
the case, I might personally hope for a more atheistic world, and tolerate a shrinking fellowship as a
price worth paying for life in a more enlightened world.

Well, the corner has turned on religious activity in America, and we are rapidly becoming as secular as
our European and East Asia counterparts. Churchgoing has fallen to an all-time low, and most churches are
small operations hovering on the brink of shutdown. The
problem is, the ranks of the atheists of the Carl Sagan variety have not grown, not in the least. It seems
the garden-variety irreligious do not practice the Atheism of the Principled. Instead they do, well, 
whatever they used to do when they were religious, except now they seem
to invent their own religion out of bits of information and wishful thinking pieced together from cable news, youtube
channels and pseudoscientific viral videos.

There has been much study over the sorts of people that support authoritarian movements. It is claimed
that many such people are "religious." The reality is quite different. For the most part, they are people
who _identify with a religion but do not practice it_. For them, religion is simply a label of how they want
others to think of them. The result are people who are religious in claim, but atheistic in practice.
An atheist may object to this characterization - claiming such people are still "religious" and should not
be taken as "true Atheists." But then, the distinction between these true atheists are not really in belief
or in action, but in self-identified tribe, since the beliefs themselves don't seem to be the distinguishing
feature. Indeed, much of the alt-Right has shifted its emphasis from Christianity as being
important to "Christian Heritage" as being important, given that many of their more hardcore elements
have adapted the same skepticism of Christianity and religion as is practiced by the atheistic hard-right philosophers
they follow.

The problem is that many atheists have their own idealistic, even unrealistic view of
atheism, one in which all of their fellow athests share a particlar atheistic creed that is neither natural
nor universal: that all men are created equal under the law, that the rule of law is important for a 
stable society, that education is a right and a privelege, that those different than others are as deserving
of respect as us, and a host of other claims of enlightenment-era liberalism. A brush with any 
of the extremely online alt-right
nonreligious will inform you of just how wrongheaded this belief is. Such beliefs are completely
indepent of atheism, but are just markers of rigorous
formal education and decency. Most committed relgious believers with 
rigorous formal education also believe these
same things. The fact that mistaken as corrolaries of atheism is due the fact these self-
selected atheists all come from this pool of people.

The dynamics of this are explained by Abdu'l-Baha in his work _The Secret of Divine Civilization_:

> There are some who imagine that an innate sense of human dignity will prevent man from 
> committing evil actions and insure his spiritual and material perfection. That is, that 
> an individual who is characterized with natural intelligence, high resolve, and a driving 
> zeal, will, without any consideration for the severe punishments consequent on evil acts, 
> or for the great rewards of righteousness, instinctively refrain from inflicting harm on 
> his fellow men and will hunger and thirst to do good. And yet, if we ponder the lessons of 
> history it will become evident that this very sense of honor and dignity is itself one of 
> the bounties deriving from the instructions of the Prophets of God. We also observe in infants 
> the signs of aggression and lawlessness, and that if a child is deprived of a teacher's 
> instructions his undesirable qualities increase from one moment to the next. It is therefore 
> clear that the emergence of this natural sense of human dignity and honor is the result 
> of education. Secondly, even if we grant for the sake of the argument that instinctive 
> intelligence and an innate moral quality would prevent wrongdoing, it is obvious that

Much as I would love for the world to contain a plethora of Carl Sagans, for the most part, the secular
turn of society has instead brought to us a raftload of Eric Cartmens. Much as I hope for the best of secularism,
I do not expect it to deliver goodness.
