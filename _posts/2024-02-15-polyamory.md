## Polyamory - How Is It a Thing, Now?
Once in a while there is a buzzy concept that enters the public eye that is so ridiculous I wonder
what people are thinking. Almost always, it is someone selling a discredited idea that they wish to
sell as novel, while attacking institutionts cherished my many, usually with
the idea to weaken it for their own strange ends.

Let's take, for instance, the sudden supicious push toward legitimization of "sex work," which
[I already wrote abput in a blog post](2019-12-14-sex-work-yeah-right.md).
The recent pop-culture news columns talking about "sex work" makes for some fun news reading, 
highlighting an endless parade of young women hawking OnlyFans
accounts. But its serious subtext seemes suspiciously convenient for both 
a) desperate men with money who think their money should be
able to purchase anything they want and b) attractive, media-friendly women in their early twenties eager to
use their bodies as the coveted material resource that many regarded it as, without having to resort to dangerous
professions that would sacrifice their health and ruin their marital prospects five years hence when they 
are ready for a "real relationship."

Naturaly, these participants do not give these reasons when asking for legitimization; instead
their arguments
are always about feedom of agency, or owning one's body, or the "need" for such an outlet in society.
We've heard this argument a thousand times before: it's the same argument libertarians always make
whenever they want to do something 
that makes the world a little worse for their benefit. 

And a similar thing is going on with marriage.
So now we are told by some that the binary, monogamous marriage is an
outmoded concept, that the "traditional marriage" with all of its structure is somehow unnatural while
others are finding their own path through more flexible group marriages and open marriages. This suspicion
that something else is actually going on was clarified to me by a recent article in _The Atlantic_ that mostly
discusses [the miserable nature of the institution as seen by one of its boosters](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/02/polyamory-ruling-class-fad-monogamy/677312]).
Titled "Polyamory, the Ruling Class's Latest Fad," it looked at the concept from a class-based view, 
noting the almost entirely upper-middle class nature of
the practice and the wealth required to enjoy the arrangement in practice. While I share the same negative 
opinion on polyamory, it's for a different reason.

My opinion is that the intellectual ferment over polyamory and the "limitations" of monogamous marriage is
fueled by dressed-up arguments that misdirect attetion from what 
its proponents really want. It isn't hard to figure out that "polyamory" and other forms of "open marriage"
benefit
1. Well-off men who wish to have the benefit of marriage and family while still sleeping with whoever they want;
2. Beautiful young women who wish for committment from men but are still eager for multiple suitors.

As much as their proponents may argue that "it isn't about sex," let's be clear: _this is just about sex_.
If it were about other things - the extended networks of kinship, emotional openness, relationships outside
the closed nuclear family, and all that yada yada, then all these things are possible _without actually
involving marriage_.

If the rest of us go along with this, we are chumps choosing are play the game on their terms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

As Baha'is, we believe in a monogamous marriage contract,
with no outlet given for sexual gratification outside of it. We discourage divorce but allow it. This is incredibly
ho-hum as far as things go. This is also the very model of exactly what these people are rebelling against. 
The only way to sleep with someone is to divorce your current partner. Where's the fun in that? The reasons
why it is rebelled against are obvious. 

Rather than go with the almost entirely-negative comments on monogamous marriage, let's review the
practical benefits of this institution first.

For participants, it has obvious benefits:
* Eliminates the need for time-consuming searches for opportunities to mate;
* Ensures the stability of the long-term relationship during the unavoidable stressful times that any married couple will face;
* Creates definite responsibilities for childrearing, an onerous and burdensome task (no matter how much one may like their own mini-me's);
* Ensures certainty of paternaty, ensuring women that men will stick around to raise their children and men will not be fooled into supporting children they were not responsible for fathering;
* Ensures a stable environment for children, ensuring that there are at least some personal elements that are stable through early life;
* Maintains social pressures to ensure married women will not be unceremoniously dumped after childbearing renders them less attractice;

These are not nothing.
In particular, _The Atlantic_ article points out that for people of average means, this is an ideal way
of reducing the risks associated with raising children. Even for those who do not have children, it guarantees
a modicum of stability in the longer term.

But the strongest advantages are probably seen by society itself, and particularly _those who are are either
seeking marriage or even just wish to have relationships while choosing to be single_:
* Married people are "off the market" in a rather public fashion, making it obvious when there are significant committments that inhibit relationship-forming;
* For women particularly, willingness to marry is a powerful signal of the suitor's committment. A suitor who expresses the desire to marry indicates a willingness to stay in a relationship, something very important for women who wish to eventually bear children.
* Attractive men and women are generally "paired off," giving remaining singles a chance to shift their gaze downward to other singles that are available for them. (In my opinion, one reason marriage has declined is that nowadays this is not the case so much, meaning everyone else doesn't "get practical" until age has robbed them of some attractiveness.)
* Children as a whole are more educated, as parents are able to better focus on time-consuming childrearing tasks, as they do not have to engage in the time committments necessary for continued courtships;
* Stable family units mean that children are taken care of and generally grow up to be effective citizens.

In all of the discussions of polyamory, what is lost is the fact that in these new flexible arrangements, many
of the advantages of the monogamous marriage are lost. Variations on the monogamous marriage that may seem advantages
to one marriage partner may have negative effects for the other marriage partner. Not only that, weakening of
marriage as a general norm means weakening some of the advantages of this arrangement to society. Recently, lower rates
of childbirth have been associated with lower and later rates of marriage; perhaps these two are not a coincidence.
Recent surveys asking why women don't have as many children as they desire have pointed to exactly that, as
many women unable to have children bemoan the lack of suitors willing to engage in committed relationships.

When weighing this then, if monogamy as a norm is given up, what is gained in return? What is gained by going
to a polyamorous relationship? Most likely, it's this:
* The most attractive person in a marriage gets to sleep with other people.

That's it, really. Everything else is just dressing up the situation. That's why over time, the women tend
to tire of the game - because the passing of time ensures their suitors thin out. Such a women should be
hopeful that their husband isn't _too_ physically fit or successful, for if he is, he will frequently
leave her home alone to pursue his dalliances.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, one last word about monogamy. As "unnatural" as some people think monogamy is, it seems awful odd that
there have been so few models for group marriage in human history.
Indeed, society has evolved an incredible amount in our known history, and there is a vast diversity of
forms of family life and maritial arrangements. And among all this diversity, the sorts of
group marriages proclaimed as "natural" are anything but. 

Across the world, there are really only three types
of family units family unit, basically:
1. Stable monogamy - either through nuclear or extended families;
2. Stable polygyny (one man, multiple wives, multiple households);
3. Anoemic (no formal unit)

The overwhelming majority of societies in the world now practice stable monogamy, but even in the ancient
world, stable monogamy was fairly usual. Polygyny, when it was allowed, was generally the purview
of high-status men, the tribal chieftains or warlords who took women as battle spoils, and their more
civilized upper-class descendents, mostly in the Islamic world, who did the same thing later with money.
Societies that practice polygyny are a
shrinking minority for obvious reasons; there aren't more women than men, and there certainly aren't more
women of childbearing age than men who wish to have sex with such women, 
so such societies generally result in young men having
far too few opportunities to find mates, and are frequently warlike and unstable, as said young man engage in
aggressive and risk-taking behaviors. These behaviors don't mesh well with modern societies, and lead to
social dynamics more befitting a tribe of baboons than a group of humans seeking to function. 
Some societies responded to these pressures by arranging marriages primarily within extended
families, which eased the pressure somewhat by ensuring most men would eventually be able to marry,
but with an obvious drawback.

That leaves the "anoemic" family as the sole alternative that has propagated througout history. 
This family unit is, essentially, no family unit. Or rather, there were units _as such_; thy were
just households thrown together in a semipermanent fashion under entirely contingent relationshis,
always within the bounaries of a tribe.
Many who point to polyamory as being "natural" are talking about just thse sorts of units.

But we have studies of such societies. The backers of polyamory have almost certainly heard of
Margaret Mead's writings, where she gave a rather idyllic picture of a
polynesian paradise of sexual openness and natural free love. Unfortunately, later sociologists noted
unusually high levels of violence in such societies, almost certainly due to the fact they were
riven with instability and jealousies. And indeed, the main strain in polyamorous arrangements is jealousy.
Defenders of polygamous or polyamorous relationships are open about this danture, and indicate they
try to react to such jealousies by stuffing them or
shaming them as "immature" within the boundaries of the relationship. Such defenders
seem to regard it as a sort of moral
failing on their part. But jealousy is not about to be repealed as an emotion, and a marriage
is something where seething jealousy is a natural, freuent reaction that one must consistently fight.
The fact that participants in polyamourous
relationships are made to regularly feel jealousy is unforgivable under any circumstance
constitutes a sort of emotional
gaslighting, something that would be regarded as emotional abuse in any other set of circumstances. 

But back to our polynesian paradise of amorous free love. What is missing in these discussions is 
acknowledgement of the contingent nature of these traditional
households. That is, nothing kept you from forming such arrangements - or abandoning them on
a whim. It isn't surprising there was no legal framework - but there was no no social sanction either.
Such arrangements do not comprise a "family" any more than That One Floor in the College
Dorm Everybody Knew About Where Everyone Was Sleeping With Each Other.
Family and marriage imply a _legal_ institution, something the LGBT community has been at great pains to point out
over the past several decades whenever more conservative forces insisted nonlegal relationships should be
sufficient.

The fact is, most of us will not find a benefit in polyamory, and its purveyors are likely to remain a
tiny minority. Polyamorous relationships are likely to be too complex for the emotional health of
its members over any sort of long term, and "open marriages" are likely to fall apart whenever a menopausal
woman finds herself still attached to an aging high-status man who fancies himself an "alpha male." I do
not fear the widespread adoption of such measures. I do, however, fear some of the results from being a
bit too open-minded and accepted. People who are happily married - and there are plenty of them - shouldn't
be cowed into thinking their arrangement is lacking. And single women who want to have families should feel
justified in thinking they shouldn't have to "share" a spouse just to get that to happen.
It isn't a problem if you get offended if your spouse wants to "open
up your marriage." It is a problem if society decides that you're being selfish and jealous for thinking
that.`
