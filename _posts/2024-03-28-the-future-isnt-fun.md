## When The Future Stops Being Fun

One of the puzzles of the commentariat is why our body politic seems to be in such a grumpy mood, universally.
Some of it, I suspect, is that much of our public dialog is now dominated by Gen X'ers and aging baby boomers.
My fellow gen X'ers seemed to have been born crotchety, a cast of South Park charaters that gleefully embraced 
libertarianism while wondering why everyone else is so horrible to one other. As for the aging baby boomers, 
being on a fixed income means hoping nothing anywhere anyplace every changes. But I suspect there is more to
this than generational angst. The problem seems to be a deep continental pessimism that is alien to the
traditional American spirit.

The problem seems to be a "fear of the future." Those with a scientific bent - or with functioning brain cells -
have no problem pinpointing why they fear for there future. Mankind's collective inability to limit ecological
degredation or carbon emissions in spite of the evident need to do so would rob anyone enlightened of hope for a better
tomorrow. But that doesn't explain the other 90% of people, who honestly could care less yet seem to be sharing
this collective funk.

I'm convinced a big part of it is the future stopped being "fun." If you examine both our own lives and science
fiction, I think you'll see why. Even more so, look at the recent invention and gadgets that may have come into
your lives over the past ten years. Has there been
any techonological advances that made your life better? Or anything that made me more optimistic about the future?

Perhaps the reason I'm still optomistic is I'm too geeky to have normal concerns.
At least for me, broadly, the push toward "electrification" and improvement has made things broadly better.
Electric cars allow me to transport myself more cheaply, without refills or pollution. Split-unit heat pumps
have allowed me to inexpensively air-condition my hundred-year-old house without running vents. I've ditched
my gas stove for an eletric induction range that boils water in less than half the time. And if I stay put,
when my burner goes, I'll probably exchange that for a geothermal heat pump that will heat me for much less
than the oil deliveries I have to pay for. I can probably cut my electric bills even further by adding a
solar roof. These are all things that weren't readily part of our lives just
ten years ago.

But it's not surprising most people don't share my glee in this. First of all, every one of these requires
an up-front investment. In most cases, the only way you'd buy such a product is if the old one broke,
in which case it's an unwanted expense. And let's not overlook an entire industry dedicated toward making
such technologies as unappealing as possible in the name of ensuring our nation's continued addition
to oil. Otherwise, they
simply replace things that already were working perfectly fine, albeit with much worse externalities.
Yes, the split-unit has made life much better for your typical apartment-dweller eager to ditch the
ugly, loud window-unit A/C, but for the most part, these improvements are marginal.

Other reasons for optimism include the routinization of spaceflight and space travel. SpaceX, a commerical
enterprise, recently had all FOUR LAUNCHING PADS busy all weekend long with four separate flights, all over the
course of a weekend. This is amazing progress considering how long space travel seemed stalled after
the Apollo missions; such capability seemed unthinkable for NASA, let alone a profit-making commerical
entity.

But here again, my joy in these technologies is entirely that of the technological geek.
In spite of this progress, space travel will require millenia of steady technological developments before
it is a meaningful part of our life. "Space tourism" as it is presently, is a poor simulacra; a million
dollar trip just to go into low-earth orbit for a half hour hardly seems the stuff of science
fiction novels.

Unfortunately, there is a serious lack of fun and benefit in any of thse developments.

If we think back to the boomers - the last generation that was optomistic about the future - we'll
see that technological developments during their time growing up were more significant and
qualitatively better.
Possibly the biggest change was the move to the suburbs, which was possible thanks to the car, itself
was a technological innovation. This made possible suburbs: cheap, brand new housing for
many (whites), who could then
afford to decamp from cities with their expensive rents and poor housing stock. Outside of that,
a host of innovations made lives easier. Think of the devices that started as luxuries but then became
necessities in the postwar period. First washers and dryers became common; then dishwashers.
Expensive, finicky black and white televisions gave way to color TVs so affordable that even
the poorest families had them. Trash compaictors, microwaves, personal computers and a host of other
developments filled out the modern household, which now is much as it was forty years ago, albeit
with less ugly hues in the kitchen.

For anyone born after 2000, the only significant quality-improving technology has been the
smartphone. While extremely convenient, most regard its presence with a mix of love and loathing.
It is so ubiquitous and useful that we cannot part with it. Yet for many, there is a realization that
this has not been an unadulterated blessing. If you've ever come home to find your entire family
staring at phones, or if you've ever had to waste half an hour with an unruly app just to pay your
bills or get customer service, you know what I mean.

The latest red-letter development is "generative artificial intelligence," which is nowadays
just called AI. An innovative technology that nobody seems to like or want. A technology that has
almost singlehandedly soured the public image of Big Tech companies, companies that once inexplicably earned the
"most trusted" labels from eager consumers. Why has it been
greeted so negatively? Just look at the benefits:

* Neat technological demos

Now let's compare that with the downsides for the non-business-owning classes.
The earliest, most aggressive use, has been as
customer service chatbots, where they have proven just as incompetent as the worst in-person representatives.
Otherwise, AI is sold and seen primarily as tools forcing overworked workers to do more-with-less, as
pointy-haired bosses insist to employees that these tools must be the key to rapidly improving
productivty, all without ever indicating how employees might benefit from their introduction.
All this while business owners look for any angle that can reduce expensive salaried employees.

With this in mind, is it any wonder people are pessimistic about the future?

If the leaders of the country want to cure the pessimism that ails the country, they'd do well
to think how to direct society to give people something to look forward to in the future.
More, cheaper stuff isn't the answer. Letting people make things worse
certainly isn't helping either.
