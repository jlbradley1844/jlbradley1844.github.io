## On the Perils of an Official Religion
Among the religious class, there is a large amount of hand-wringing about the increasing numbers
of people who consider themselves non-religious or secular. A contributed article to 
[_Christianity Today_](https://christianitytoday.com/ct/2021/may-webonly/christian-persecution-political-privilege-growth-decline.html) by Nilay Saiya
offers a surprising but compelling explanation. One of the reasons for increasing
irreligiousity is the _increasing_ amount of state support for official religions. 
This isn't idle speculation culled from anecdotes either, but 
[comes from a peer-reviewed study published in the jorunal _Sociology of Religion_](https://academic.oup.com/socrel/article-abstract/83/1/60/6213975?login=false)
If it seems like a familiar argument, it's because others have made the same claim,
just without statistical backing.

Take, for instance, Europe, one of the most secular places in the world. One thing that
distinguishes Europe from other places is the commonplace acceptance of official "state
religions" - the Anglicanism of the UK, the various official Lutheran synods of the Nordic
and Germanic countries, the state Orthodoxes of Eastern Europe. All of these official religions
enjoy a measure of state support. Ironically, what they are lacking is popular engagement; the
churches have been empty for generations now. The writer contrasts this to places where
Christianity specifically is growing - and notes that its growth and engagement is most rapid
in places like Africa and the Far East, in nations that have no favored state religion.

The example that seems to prove the point is the United States, whose Constitution explicitly
disallows establishment of a state religion, and whose citizens remain far more religiously
engaged than their otherwise culturally-similar European counterparts. The point the study is
making, a bit indirectly, is that this competitive culture means that the religions 
_themselves_ are better. In the article summarizing the study, Saiya offers the probable
explanation. Without state support, the various creeds must make more
compelling arguments, must accomodate as many as possible and must provide meaningful
religious experience, lest they wither away in the face of competition.

This argument isn't without its holes. The famously secular France is also famously anti-religious,
and the only sign of religious ferment in that country seems to be within their frequently-denigrated
minority muslim community. The conservatives in the country seem interested not so much in
strengthening Christianity as they are interested in using it to keep muslim immigrants in their place.
And one could easily say that this is confusing cause and effect.
Increasing secularism leads to a desire by the insecure religious to impose their practices on
both religious minorities and the otherwise apathetic. One can easily see 
the end result in current political culture, where
religious creeds have essentially made themselves lapdogs of otherwise morally-suspect nationalists,
who promise the religious cheap victories for votes.

Whether cause or effect, the temptation to enshrine official religious practice seems to correlate
quite strongly with religious weakness. The religion, unable to compel attention through force of
good example, instead chooses to ensure its continued status by kneecapping other religions. Free to
use the agencies of government to evangelize with their own propaganda, the religion feels no need
to compete intellectually; and thanks to state support, there is never any need to invoke the spirit of
sacrifice so crucial to a religiously vital fellowship. The result is a complacent, entrenched creed,
which is either roundly ignored, as are the various institutions in Europe, or are actively despised
by a large minorities of both the most and least religious, as in Iran. In spite of the weakness of
religious competition, frequently such rivals wind up looking good just by sheer contrast.

Those who believe state support of religion will strengthen religion would do well to
reflect on why such state support came to be in the first place. The great state
religions were not established to strengthen religion, but to weaken its influence. 
Perhaps to keep the Catholic
bishops from interfering in the King's business! Or maybe to co-opt powerful religious
leaders, as was the case in the various Islamic states. State religion was a tool to
strengthen _the state_, not the religion. Such state religions are different only
in degree from ancient Egypt, where the pharoh was regarded as an actual God Himself and
treated as such.

### The Actual Problem of "Cultural Christianity"

To a Christian, the primary concern is that a priveleged Christianity is a far less vital
one. To other observers, the concern is quite different; a weakened religion is one that is
tempted to seize the reigns of power, in an effort to stave off a decline in the prestige
and material benefits provided by that religion. Often it is the perceived decline of utility
that motivates believers to seek state sanction, rather than care for the faith itself.

I've been a Catholic, and I am a Baha'i. Contrasting the two from a spiritual and creedal
level, the two have both similarities and differences, and these differences led me to
identify as Baha'i, while a good many other Catholics would find the Baha'i Faith uncompelling.
But from the point of view of _material benefit_, there is no comparison.
When it comes to practical, material benefits, the Catholic church wins hands-down. Better churches,
more glorious holiday celebrations, opportunities for professional networking - even the music
(how are you possibly going to compete with Bach??). The practical benefits of being a Baha'i
seem mighty small in nature.

For many, the practical benefits are the draw itself.
For every person who is a devout believer and an active volunteer, there is at least one,
and probably several, who are "cultural Christians," to use the terminology of nagging
pastors. People which hardly step into church, but like knowing it's there. Love the idea
of their children being married in a grand church - if only for show. Adore the idea that
somehow, some way, they are connected to powerful institutions that they belong to, if
only through sentimental attachment. They may strongly identify themselves as Christian; they treasure
their "Christian Heritage"; they vote for politicians who proclaim "Judeo-Christian
values"; they love their Christian upbringing and think of themselves as belonging in
a Christian nation. They may even partake in "Christian fandom," reading Christian books
and listening to Christian music. But aside from their affect and attachments, one could not tell
their creed from their behavior.

Now, a thought experiment. Imagine that the most devout, detached Catholic somehow fell
into a fifty year coma, only to wake up and find that in that intervening time, the Catholic
church had dwindled to less then one million believers in the US, while the Baha'i Faith had entrenched
itself as a sizeable religious minority many times larger, with proclaimed 
believers in positions of power throughout
business and culture. Even the purest Catholic would find this to be an unimaginable horror.
Only the most devout would find their religious faith strengthened by such hardship; most would
be unimaginably depressed to find out the only mass celebrated took place in a house on the
other side of town with no more than two dozen people in attendance, and sullen to find
their friends and neighbors members of an unrecognizeable faith.

But if such a person were a true Christian, you would find their faith would still not 
be weakened. No, they would feel far more threatened if they were a "cultural Christian."
The sense of loss would hit them far _more_ than the truly religious. They do
not have an actual religion to fall back onto! Their association at best
gives them a vague feeling that
the world is populated by people "like them" who somehow shares the same creed.
Unfortunately, when a culture shrinks in power, it affects those most strongly attached
to the culture for its power. Such people are loath to give up what the imagine to be conferred
status.

The upshot is that it is not the most religious that are tempted to entrench religious
practice into state support. It is the most attached but least religious;
those who identify with it as a mark of identity and a fashion statement, and those that are
most likely to react to threats to their religion by attempting to entrench it through
legal compulsion into the public square.

Unfortunately, something of the sort is happening now, just as it happened in Iran almost
fifty years ago. Christianity is slowly shrinking. While the
megachurches get all the attention, the average American church is a small church, of
less than 100 families, that is financially on-the-ropes and can barely pay a part-time
pastor. Even the healthy churches are marked by shrinking, aging congregations.
A retiree need not fall into a coma to know that religion was far more central to community
life when they were a child then it is nowadays. I myself remember my early childhood
in Louisvilee, where it was still possible to see nuns in habits
walking on the street in Louisville. Not only are the habits gone, but the nuns wearing them,
and the great religious orders are nearly extinct. As are many of the other cultural markers
that signify active Christian practice as the default state for most Americans.
Those who identify as Christian but are used to having
Christianity be something they like seeing other people do on their behalf will react to 
"abominations" like secular organizations and Muslim communities by making the government
"fix things" for them, in the hope they can get back the "Christian wallpaper" coloring
the background of their lives.

### What Does This Mean for the Baha'i Faith?

The reader has probably figured out I very much agree with the thesis
undergirding this study; I do think that
establishment of a state religion weakens the religion, and is usually a sign of a sick
religion rather than a healthy one.

So as a Baha'i, I now feel compelled to answer the $64,000 question, which any student of the Faith
must have. Namely, this writing by Baha'i authority Shoghi Effend in the fifties:

>  ...the steadily evolving Faith of Bahá'u'lláh through its present stages of obscurity, 
>  of repression, of emancipation and of recognition -- stages one or another of which 
>  Bahá'í national communities in various parts of the world now find themselves in -- to 
>  the stage of establishment, the stage at which the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh will be 
>  recognized by the civil authorities as the state religion, similar to that which
>  Christianity entered in the years following the death of the Emperor Constantine, a
>  stage which must later be followed by the emergence of the Bahá'í state itself,
>  functioning, in all religious and civil matters, in strict accordance with the
>  laws and ordinances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy, the Mother-Book of the
>  Bahá'í Revelation, a stage which, in the fullness of time, will culminate in the
>  establishment of the World Bahá'í Commonwealth, functioning in the plenitude of its
>  powers, and which will signalize the long-awaited advent of the Christ-promised Kingdom
>  of God on earth -- the Kingdom of Bahá'u'lláh -- mirroring
>  however faintly upon this humble handful of dust the glories of the Abha Kingdom.
>
>   (Shoghi Effendi, Messages to the Baha'i World - 1950-1957, p. 155)

This paints a rather triumphalist picture of the
Baha'i Faith. In this framing, the Baha'i Faith is to become not just a state religion but,
indeed, the state itself. In the telling of some critics, this is a repeat of the Universal Caliphate
longed for by many Muslims. This is not an isolated quotation either; Shoghi Effendi
consistently envisions the Baha'i as eventually being a "state religion" in the distant future,
on par with the many others in the world and eventually overtaking them.

Unfortunately, the vivid language of this passage and others like it clouds the fact that this triumph
itself should not be understood as a repeat of past episodes in our histories. It
_cannot_ be, if the Baha'i Faith is to stay true to its aims and its claims. Baha'is who
wish to defend his vision would be helped by anticipating how such a state relationship must
substantitally differ from current arrangements; particularly the current
government of Iran, which claims to fulfill the
exact same mandate. Those outside the Baha'i Faith are unlikely to be convinced by arguments
such as "Yes, but the reason the Baha'i government will work is our religion is _true_."

In my opinion, there are sufficient writings in the Baha'i Faith that would contravene any
state sponsorship similar to current arrangements in the past or present. Shoghi Effendi
warns his readers against being misled by their own desires for the future, telling
the believers: 

> To claim to have grasped all the implications of Bahá'u'lláh's prodigious scheme 
> for world-wide human solidarity, or to have fathomed its import, would be presumptuous 
> on the part of even the declared supporters of His Faith. To attempt to visualize it in 
> all its possibilities, to estimate its future benefits, to picture its glory, would be 
> premature at even so advanced a stage in the evolution of mankind...

> All we can reasonably venture to attempt is to strive to obtain a glimpse of the first 
> streaks of the promised Dawn that must, in the fullness of time, chase away the gloom 
> that has encircled humanity.

> (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Baha'u'llah, p. 34)

A scan through writings in _Lights of Guidance_ is enough to indicate that such concepts such
as the "Universal Tribunal," "World Government," "World Order of Baha'u'llah" are defined only
in the vaguest of terms, yet seem to be crucial for understanding any future evolution of The Faith.
In my opinion, study of Shoghi Effendi's writings indicate that his writings are
_eschatology_ - not an agenda for near-term action but a fortelling of a long-term vision
and end state. In so many cases,
when he presents this vision, he contrasts its greatness and gloriousness against
the seemingly minor yet terribly important acts that all early believers had to carry out,
no matter how unimportant to the greater world they may have appeared. A vision is not the same as
a detailed roadmap.

There are Baha'i works which are explicitly political and prescriptive, and nowhere among
these are we urged to seek state saction and enforcement, in spite of this vision.
Indeed, _The Secred of Divine Civilization_ by Abdu'l-Baha may be the most important political
work in the Baha'i Canon. It discusses the great importance of religion, yet gives no call for
state support; as far the theocratic institutions of his time, Abdu'l-Baha was trenchant in his appraisal.
A deeper understanding of point is elucidated in a letter from the Universal House of Justice
on 27-Apr-1995 to a Baha'i researcher,
"Separation of Church and State." In this, they caution the Baha'is from making
premature conclusions about the expected evolution of the Faith, making clear that the present realities
and stage in humanity's evolution mean we are too ill-informed to conclude the shape of any
such future government with any confidence. Baha'is must instead concern themselves with
the needs of the world as it presently is, understanding that any end state must represent
an evolution in response to the needs of the world, an evolution whose progress is impossible
to imagine. 

All of which is to say, that any prophecy of a future for the Baha'i Faith that looks like
"an elected caliphate, but _good_" is one that is as distorted as the imaginings
of its most ardent critics.

This points back to the original point of this article: an examination of the dangers of
an official state religion. The actual weight of human history warns us of the
temptations for any religion that attempts to establish itself as a state religion. History
has shown that the main people agitating for such establishment have not been the most devout
believers, or those who wish to use religion to do the most good. Rather, they have been political
actors hoping to use the religious cause to their own ends of wielding power, and less devout
religionists who associate themselves with a religion for the material and social benefits
that go with it, seeking to increase the practical benefits gained by this association. Establishment
in the end winds up benefitting the most those who wish to weaken the religion, and it is the religion
itself that becomse the primary victim of its establishment.

The Baha'i Faith in the future will therefore have an unexpectedly difficult task. Many Baha'is look forward to a far
future where Baha'i communities form a majority in a region, even in a nation, and can make good
on the prophecy of Shoghi Effendi. But this
is only one challenge that meets The Faith, and possibly the smaller one. The greater challenge is how to keep the
religion vital when it becomes a majority movement, and how it must avoid misuse by those
who view it as a source of power. The strongest
religion may be the one that realizes that it cannot safely
seize secular power in the manner typically understood in this day and age.
