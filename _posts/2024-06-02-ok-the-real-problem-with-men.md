#### An Introduction to The Problem With Men: Baboon Morality
Consider the mandrill baboon.
Mandrill baboons are known mainly for their appearance - their colorful, photogenic faces
and their fire-engine-red butts. Once you know about their societies, you'll forget the
appearance and think you've stepped into the worlds' worst society.
Zoologists who have studied mandrill baboons have noted
that they spend perhaps only a few hours out of their day procuring food and doing what is
needed to survive. Given this easy living, they do what mandrill baboons do in the remaining
hours - making life horrible for other mandrill baboons. The males, of course, spend
their life entirely in agression-based dominance behavior in attempts to become the leaders
of their packs. Not that this is an enviable position, since doing so automatically
makes you a target of the other mandrill baboons. And so they spend their entire lives
conniving and fighting with one another.

Of course, they are said to do this
because this allows them to mate with all sorts of female baboons. No word on whether the
female baboons enjoy this sort of behavior or not.

If you're one of those people that think evolution is all about design and fitness and
that everything is somehow adaptive, it would be hard to figure why evolution has made 
baboons in this manner. The truth is, it didn't; evolution doesn't work that way. It doesn't
particularly care what behavior is selected for, provided it doesn't kill off the
species entirely. Plainly, humans outnumber mandrill baboons exceptionally, so perhaps
humans are a bit more well-adapted. Meanwhile, nature in its wisdom has chosen to make the
mandrill baboon a sometimes-hilarous example to humans of just how miserable we can
make each other if we are bound and determined to show our worst side to everyone all
of the time.

A moment's reflection is enough to consider that evolutionary pressures did not
select for this behavior from the males of _homo sapiens_.
Let's consider, shall we, what would happen to any male in a hunter-gatherer society
who decided to take control of a pack in the same manner as a mandrill baboon alpha.
He would rally the beta males and rule with an iron fist. He and his friends would
have his pick of food and mates. And one day he would not wake up, due to a mysterious
head injury received while sleeping. Or he would not return from his hunting party,
due to an "accident."

People, you see, don't take fondly to other people who act like alpha baboons. Our early
hunter-gatherer societies, while not as egalitarian as some of the anthropologists
would like to believe, had little use for petty tyrants, and our early progenitors would have to wait
for the invention of bronze tools and organized armies before actual tyrants could come along.
Yet somehow the male-as-alpha-baboon, a heroic figure who takes what he wants and makes no excuses,
figures prominently in male self-help literature.

## OK, Here's the Real Problem with Men

I made the mistake the other day of watching a YouTube video. The reason I watched it was
it appeared it would be informative. The reason it was a mistake was the topic.

The topic was "the trouble with boys." It a talk by Richard Reeves, a Brooking Institute
author who has a both book and substack _Of Boys and Men_. The talk, like the book and the accompanying substack,
is a reasonable, considered examination of certain serious
problems many boys and young men have nowadays. It noted many facts, such as: the fact boys
are less successful academically than girls; the fact boys have more challenges with
behavior and learning disabilities; issues arising from boys' developmentental milestones
in cognition and development, which occur around a year later than girls; and the dramatically
worse effects this has on men in historically disadvantaged groups and minorities. Reeves was careful
to note that for grown men and women, there is no such inequality, and in the professional
world parity has been reached in all fields except those that have been traditionally
hostile to women and still may have some barriers. Reeves seems to bear no hostility toward
the women's rights movement, and indicated no desire to go back to the past. He also noted
that men in the professional class cannot in any way be said to be disadvantaged. The
disadvantage is most pronounced in the lower reaches of the economic scale, where boys
probably destined for
the working class come out of their childhood unequipped to contribute at the same level
as women, being unprepared for the more well-paying opportunities and trades and the
caring professions that would allow them to make a reasonable living.

Reeves has identified a real problem, one confirmed by the fact that lack of men able
to support themselves may be a unheralded reason for our nation's fertility problems.
Also, the points he brings up are so obvious that it's
odd that they have never been discussed before. When one researches it and finds out
that these problems _have_ been brought up in the past three decades,
repeatedly, one wonders all the more why they are ignored.

Given that this video was so informative, why did I say it was it a mistake to watch it?
Because I watched that video in YouTube once, only once,
in the weeks following I got loads
of troglodyte crap in my YouTube feed. Apparently, by watching this video, I 
signaled to YouTube that I am now interested
in "men's right," and I now want to watch videos where "men's rights" cranks blame their problems
on femenists; or, maybe I'm now interested in propaganda from the paid liars telling me how evil solar
and wind power is; or perhaps I'd like to hear from dude who says that wierdo in
HR who insists on being called a "they" is heralding
"the end of civilization" (such people used to instead say "the end of democracy," but lately
such commentors have become very disinterested in democracy, even hostile to it). 

Given this fact, it's quite easy
to ignore serious problems, when the only people that seem concerned
are those with an axe to grind against womankind and nebulous "leftists."
As far as why the problems of men are ignored, I believe I stumbled across one
reason inadvertantly. 

I do think the problem with the way men is raised is real. And the youtube presenter did suggest
serious answers. In particular: "Redshirting" many or even most boys; that is, starting them in
kindergarten or first grade one year later, being that many boys of ages 5 or 6 are simply
not ready for school in the way girls are; having more male teachers and staff in the primary schools and
kindergarten as role models; more emphasis on the possibilities of "the caring professions" in
high school counseling for teenage boys. These are all modest, reasonable, and achievable.

But the real problem with men is deeper - it's a total lack of cultivation
of one's "spiritual" side. If you can't stand that framing, think in terms of virtues or
moral deveopment. Too many boys are cultivated as if their role is to fit into the tribe
of baboons I wrote about in the introduction. Materialistic and thuggish.

Similar issues, by similarly serious authors, have been identified in the path.
But unfortunately, such responses are easily mocked. The original 
men's rights movements, with their the Robert Bly
poetry and drumming circles, seemed to at least be onto something, in that the identified
serious problems with certain unrealistic roles men were expected to fill. This movement
was particularly appealing to
men who had deep unease about certain backwards-looking ideas about innate aggression.
Unfortunately it was generally concurrent with the New Age movements
of the eighties and nineties and flamed out, probably for being
unforgivably unfashionable. If you are old enough to remember the
term SNAG (Sensitive New Age Guy) or remember characters like the squishy long-haired
teacher on _Beavis and Butthead_, then you probably vaguely remember this movement.
However, I believe that such men had a finger on the problem, 
in spite of how self-parodying the movement's solutions may have seemed.

### Horrible Solutions for Horrible People

Serious "Men's Rights" movements were never going to be popular.
Such movements threaten those with certain materialistic assumptions about "manhood"
that many have become very comfortable with.

After the "first generation" new-agey men's rights movement faded, the more skeptical,
finding the whole movement silly, instead took refuge in traditional gender roles. This was
made conveniently fashionable thanks to the buzzy nineties 
writings from the then-novel "evolutionary psychology" writers.
Intentionally or not, the sensationalistic work that caught everyone's attention were
findings that seemed to justify stereotypical sexual behavior. "Hey look, men CAN'T be
monogomous! Hey look, women NEED committment and want a successful breadwinner" and so
on. And so, the men's rights movement of
today is not nearly so likely to identify cultural roles that reward over-aggresive,
soul-deadening 
behavior as faulty, but rather blame cultural demands that require polite civilized behavior
from men - without even considering that lack of this behavior is exactly why
so many young men have issues.
The need to work together, study and reflect, qualities
that are prized in an academic and professional culture and that are increasingly
important in high-skill, high-paying profession are felt incompatibile with
manhood. Real Men(TM), thanks to the magic of Testosterone, are said to be risk-taking,
adventurous and aggresive; they eschew contemplation and think from the gut. 
Men are born to be fighters, and any culture that penalizes
them for fighting as hard as they want is somehow unfit for them.

I wish this were a straw man, but it isn't. Pick up any men's magazine and you'll
see the glorification of such "real men." Depending on the audience,
the magazine will portray such men
as unreflective or profound; simple or educated; extremely well-dressed or
not. But the ideal they present is consistent: someone who courts and conquers whatever
women they desire, pushes their way to the top, and finds a way to win.
Now, much of this can be blamed on the unspoken agenda of all media - sell
ad space. Much like women's magazines, men's magazines
are tilted toward showcasing viewpoints that would make the readers feel they need the advertized
products. Yet it's obvious the readership is in some sense sympatico to these attitudes,
or the magazines would never sell. The situation is, as you'd expect, far worse in
the cesspool of social media, where charismatic yet insipid "men's rights" speakers
glorify consumption, aggression and a host of baboon behaviors.

Nor have religious leaders been much better; many churches have given into the temptation to
grow their ministries by catering to these Conan Barbarian warrior-man
notions. Perhaps no men's  book has been as
influential within churches as the old evangelical favorite _Wild at Heart_. This book posed that the
Christian church as practiced had problems retaining men because it was feminizing
in practice; that men were beings of action, incapable of the stillness and
reflection and prayer, and that a real man was a conquering hero to his wife
and feels empty if she cannot fight for her. Always fighting. 

And if you look at the "self-help" books
targeted specifically at men - a narrow marketing segment if there ever was one - you'll generally find
books like _Power_, which seems to be an updated version of the old _Looking Out for
Number One_. Why work on your soul when you can step on the Little People instead?

Given such conlusions, it is no surprising that the "solutions" posed by 
"men's rights" writer simply worsen things by creating other problems.
For instance, "feminism" is frequently blamed for such issues,
but it's hard to see how rolling back the clock on woman's rights will change 
any of the actual issues holding back boys and young men,
such as lack of school readiness due to slower frontal neocortext development.
My own cynical opinion is such commenters are simply using "men's rights" movements
as a convenient platform for venting their gripes.

### The Male Spiritual Handicaps

It appears the efforts of the last three decades of men's rights movements has been thoroughly
counterproductive. The glorification
of stereotypical men's behavor - aggression, fighting and general @ssh0lery as somehow
being "natural" to men and deserving of accomodation by society - is a part of the
problem, not the solution. As a result, many of the men most concerned 
about the problems of young men - and young men do
have problems earlier generations do not have -  cannot see the problem 
_because their upbringing as men has trained them to not see the problem_. The problem is this:

    Morally and spiritually, too many men are developmentally arrested.
    To use a non-PC term (the men's rights groups love those), most men are "spiritually retarded."

Those who are students of the Baha'i Faith would very easily place their fingers on
the source of these defective beliefs - materialism. People are animals, but at the
same time, very different from animals in their spiritual characteristics. Our animal
nature only explains a part of what we are, possibly the least important part. The early
men's rights groups rightly noted a dissonance between stereotypical mens' roles and
their own spiritual natures. In as materialistic society such as ours, it is no surprise
the main reaction was mockery. The counterreaction was, of course, extremely materialistic
in outlook, which may explain why it was also so obnoxious and disagreeable to many.

Still, it does seem that men have certain natural handicaps, one which present individualistic
culture does nothing to help. Women, for multiple reasons - acculturation, earlier brain
development, their physically smaller status - are less likely to use physical force
as a crutch to get their way. They learn at an early age that it pays to be nice, or at
least, *act* nice; and treating other people as you treat yourself is important.
The fact that few fathers and mothers groom their girls to be world-conquerying
heroic Women of Destiny can only help; meanwhile, many boys find toxic levels of
ambition encouraged and cultivated, to such a level that it endangers proper character developent.

Combine that with the already-acknowledged fact that girls develop their executive
skills a year earlier and you have an environment in which girls aren't necessarily
_groomed_ for being good, but at least do not have any particular impetus to
be bad. Contrast that to boys: for many, abuse-as-long-as-you-don't-get-caught is
considered a feature, not a bug.
Likewise, should girls and women cultivate their spiritual side, society is
nothing if not indulgent. Perhaps as a result, outside of a priestly caste,
spiritual pursuits in the West are as dominated
by women as the teaching staff of a grammar school. Which itself is dependent on people who
are more oriented toward seeing others succeed than themselves.

Anyone who has children will quickly learn the fact that _boys and girls are different_,
and I'm not arguing with this fact.
Science bears this out, as does my personal experience as father of both a boy and a girl. 
Biologists know that by the time both men and women have fully matured, there is
hardly detectable difference along a number of axes of personality and mental capability;
even contrarians who have noted significantly statistical differences admit the differences
they do detect are very marginal. However, this applies to _grown adults only_; it does 
certainly not apply to boys and girls, and any second
grade teacher is forced to deal with boys and girls as if they are different alien
cohabitating species.

Faced with this fact, the challenge is to give boys and girls the same 
consistent moral and spiritual lessons. This is very easy to fail at, and the victims
of this failure are generally the boys.
When you look at all of the broader "Problems of Men" - the violence, the anoeme,
the inability to form mature relationships - all of them trace back to this failure.

For many in the Man=Testoserone crowd, this is only appropriate. Their conceit is that
men are intrinsically violent, and asking boys to be peaceful and behave is to
go against their instintive nature. Indeed, the dominating conceit of many Christian
"Men's ministries" is that moral lessons must be adapted to Men's unique
strengths; ones that lay an emphasis on such manly-man ideas such as courage,
honor and loyalty. Asking boys to be peaceful and eschew violence will cause them
to rebel or, even worse, turn them into pacifistic pantywaists.

This definition of masculinity demands serious pushback. The idea that men are inherently
violent and aggressive and that this deserves accomodation is probably 
the worst aspect of such thinking. Are these traits somehow character flaws if present
in women, but not men, because it's "unnatural"? Well, 
women can be naturally violent as well. My guess is the reason it so rarely happens
is the multiple practical factors
that mitigate against that, factors that have nothing to do with innate
biological differences. Fighting is generally something
that implies poor frontal lobe development, a very important difference between
girls and boys growing up. Not only is fighting rarer, but when occuring it is
rarely tolerated. Women quickly get the message that _girls don't fight_, unlike their
more rambunctions brothers, whose fights are greeted with a shrug and an eyeroll.
The fact that boys may have more problem with such challenges makes it
even more important that they are given unambiguous lessons. However, this isn't
what happens.

We care that girls behave good, but when it comes to boys, only 
their overburdened teachers seem to care. While many boys are trained properly, too many
are "graded on a curve" for their entire childhood, with aggressive behavior
tolerated or even rewarded.
This situation causes two broad problems. The first is that boys suffer the soft bigotry of low
expectations. If a boy has a behavioral problem, his behavior is far more likely to be 
accepted as normal; perhaps "boys being boys" or, "maybe he just has ADHD." But
it is one thing to have somewhat looser expectations for good behavior from a boy
than girls in the same grade cohort. It's
another thing entirely to excuse entirely categories of bad behavior from boys under
the theory that boys can't help it. Boys _should_ outgrow such behaviors, but if
both parents and teachers are too indulgent, it risks becoming a permanent state of
affairs.

The second, and possibly worse problem, is that too many boys are given lessons about
masculinity that directly undercut the moral lessons they are given. If you are a
girl, you are generally taught to be good, full stop. Whereas if you are a boy,
you should be good... but don't be _too good._

Think, if you can: have you ever heard of girls being taught the following lessons growing up:
* It's better to be pissed off than pissed on.
* The reason you're being bullied is because you're a wimp. Learn how to fight back!
* It's important to be nice. But it's more important to win.
* Nice guys finish last.
* And whatever you do, _don't be a pushover_.

Sound ridiculous? Of course it does. Those are something only _the boys_ are told.

In short, women are _supposed to_ be nice. And men are _supposed to_ be assholes when
needed; after all, the 
ones that aren't, are the _wimps_. That's worse than being immoral.
And that is the real lesson many boys learn from their parents.
When that is the case, we cannot be surprised that large numbers of boys are unready
for adulthood. 

If you still aren't convinced that virtue is more highly priced in women in men,
then think of this virtue: chastity.
Something many people loudly expect from their daughters and quietly condemn in their sons.
Many parents of teenage boys actually encourage
sexual conquests and experimentation. The daughters of families with such dysfunctional beliefs are, not
surprisingly, very overprotected - of course they are, what with their fathers expecting
that all boys, like their own father, are trained to engage in sexual conquests.

Given that background, anybody who blames the arrested development of numerous males
on the lack of traditional prescribed role models or on women who don't know how to
behave properly feminine is plainly blind of the problems at hand and may be part of it.

### Masculine Roles and Delegated Materialism

Possibly the greatest way in which men are handicapped is explicitly materialistic
role assigned to that gender.

Men, due to traditional gender roles, have always been seen as the "heavy labor" contingent
in society. Some of this is simply stories we tell ourselves about the past; in reality, sociologists 
know that in traditional societies women worked at least as
hard as men.
But that point aside, across a diversity of cutures, it been presumed that the role of the men was to work, and
the role of the women to raise children (oh, and work too).
Note that the emphasis was on the role. While societies may or
may not have allowed the working men to keep all or even most of the fruits of their labors,
the emphasis was always that the men had a _duty_ to work. As a man, one worked because it was
one's lot to work. Whether or not one was high or low born, to be idle was seen as shameful.

The excessive materialism and individualism of today's society has weakened this reliance
on duty. Instead, men now have a duty to _succeed_. They have a duty
to extract, however they can, _the fruits of labor_. This is quite different than a duty to
labor in and of itself.
The main reason for this is the rather toxic materialistic philosophies of the nineteenth century that were
introduced in conjunction with the industrial revolution. New nineteenth-century
materialist narratives, such as the normative _homo economus_ and Spencerian "survial of the fittest"
worldview, ensured that the primary unit of concern was individual workers who must themselves
compete for their survival; in which individuals themselves were seen as the primary determinents of the
share of the spoils. Far from being embedded in a network of family obligations, the indiviaul
worker was placed in the position of primacy, with their material productivity being seen as
their primary contribution - indeed, the only contribution to society seen as worth mentioning.
(This was extremely convenient for the wealthy of the ninteenth century.
The enlightenment philosophies had the troublesome effect of calling into question the validity
of class distinctions, but now yawning differences in wealth could conveniently be pinned on
individual unworthiness.)

The burdens of this shift fell almost entirely on men, who were the only source of _paid_ labor,
and therefore, of worth. In prior generations, men operated in societies where their worth
was generally determined by their class and familial relations. While this was an unjust
situation which mainly made sure peasants stayed peasants, at least men of that day were
not imposed upon by society to better themselves and were not told that their own low
estate was the fault of themselves. The tooth-and-nail struggle for existence, such as it
was, had once been confined only to the noble classes. Spencerian social darwinism ensured
that it was brought to the working clases as well.
And now we live in a situation where the struggle for exitence simply _seems natural_.
And it _seems natural_ that this is primarily a duty of men to carry out. The problem is
the materialistic framework in which we expect men to operate; the Real Man, far from being
valued for his worth as a person, is instead valued using the measure of
_The Baboon King_. Has he ammased a large store of wealth? Has he had a large number of
mates? Is he able to guard his chosen peers and families against preceived threats, nay,
against even slights? Then he is worthy. Otherwise he is a chump. Given this state of
affairs, it is no wonder that unhappy single men take refuge in pseudoscientific
"evolutionary psychology" writings; it seems to explain the present set of affairs far
better than philosophy, let alone religion.

## Conclusion

The problem with manhood is an unavoidable corallary of
today's aggresively materialistic culture. The question is
what to do about it. In many cases we know what to do, and the measures are
anodyne enough to be found inoffensive by anyone who would wrinkle their nose at the mention
of _values_ or _spirituality_. Unfortunately, these are quite 
modest recommendations when compared to the challenge of
a pervasive materialism, one that recommends to those unhappy with their lot that their
best bet is to simply fight harder, even fight dirty if necessary. Some men will certainly work harder,
but we know how this goes; hard work is no guarantee of success. Those for whom hard work cannot
guarantee success, those who feel even such modest rewards as a ordinary family life and
fatherhood are out of reach even in spite of their hard work, will simply choose another way
to fight. They may go for broke by gambling on get-rich-quick schemes (c.f. Bitcoin); they may
fight dirty by taking part in borderline con artistry; they may take refuge in militia movements
and dream longingly of the day TSHTF (google it), when they take with armed conflict what they think
is rightfully theirs; they can take refuge in fanatical religious movements that promise them
deliverance if only "their people" are strong enough and swift to sieze power and enshrine
themselves as a preferred elite.
Against this backdrop, "toxic masculinity" is a defective reaction, but no
worse than many of the others I've just mentioned.

Christianity would seem to be the ideal antidote: a belief system in which everyone is
felt to be equal under God, one were all are urged to serve together in spirit and
help the less fortunate as well as themselves. Unfortunately, much of this ground has
been salted by certain religious personalities whose writings ironically show the massive influence
of materialistic beliefs like social darwinism, and who gladly endorse the current state of affairs.
Instead, these authorities claim the solution to mens' problems lies in the fact that some virtues are
essential masculine, such as honor, bravery and loyalty, and these need to be more
deeply cultivated in men. These are imposing, military-sounding
qualities, and would seem to prepare men for the competitive "struggle of existence." Yet a
moment's reflection will show that as a proposed solution, it is silly. We all 
agree these are noble, essential things to
have, but entirely different sets of virtues are needed to succeed in paid work or
competitive business cultures. This solution is recommended because it sounds good to
the speaker. While this advice is salutary in that it does not
require that men act like baboon kings to get their way, someone who shows
all these virtues may still be regarded as a failure by society.

The solution, unfortunately, requires both less materialism and more of a certain kind of
materialism. It requires that men be judged on their character in day to day interactions.
More specifically, it requires that the least successful men of good character actually
be regarded as highly, perhaps moreso than successful men of poor character. As this seems entirely unlikely,
what is needed is a different sort of materialism - one that regards any hard-working
individual as meriting respect and a truly modest lifestyle. If someone is of decent
character and wants to form a family, there are no guarantees, but someone working full
time should be able to support themselves enough to raise a family. The same materialists
wringing their hands over falling birthrates will object to this line of thought most
strongly; yet, they should realize the folly of requiring men to win the "genetic lottery"
just to be able to form a family.
