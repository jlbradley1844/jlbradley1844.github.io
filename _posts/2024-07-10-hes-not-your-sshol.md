## No, He's Not Your @sshole
Over the past twenty years, psychologists have studied a number of cognitive biases
that affect people - intellectual defects that we all have, inescapable defects
in our thinking that we must educate ourselves to fight. Daniel Kahneman's pop-science
masterpiece _Thinking Fast and Slow_ is still the master key to understanding these
cognitive biases. However, I believe these biases are not fully catalogued. I'd like
to examine one very few have identified, one that comes up repeatedly in political life 
and social life: "He may be an @sshole, but at least he's MY @sshole."

There is no such thing as a "My @sshole." It is just: @sshole. The idea that someone
is horrible to everyone else _yet somehow has an inscrutable loyalty to you and you
only_ is as ridiculous as any other cognitive bias you'll read about.

Neither my wife or I claim to enjoy the sleazy true-crime type shows on network
TV, but we've seen enough to know about a stock charater that comes up repeatedly,
_the other woman_. Someone who finds a successful but unhappily-married man;
she allows
herself to be befriended, then seduced, and finally pictures herself with him
indefintely. She excuses his infidenity on the obvious deficiencies of his wife.
What happens next is horrible, of course - he's found to have
another family in Iowa, or it turns out his first wife was his 
psychotic half-sister, or he has a functioning portal to the underworld in the 
basement... whatever. After the horrible conclusion, there's
always some last words from _the other woman_, when she says without irony
_I knew he was cheating on his wife, but I thought he was **special**_. Sometimes
this thought is said by her on camera; sometimes it's read dramatically 
by the narrater because _the other woman_ is too murdered to say so herself.

That mental bias again: _Maybe he's horrible to other people, but to me he
was thoughtful. And that's all I care about._

What are we to make of this belief? Perhaps there are a handful of people that really
do have this hold on people; charismatic psychopaths that cleverly manipulate people
to do what they want them to. But many times, people know at some level that _this is not
a nice person_. Yet they still remain convinced theis relationship - romatic, 
employment, friendship, patronage,
whatever - is somehow good for them and will continue to remain so. What would make someone
believe that to be true?

Perhaps, unfortunately, this all comes down to self-flattery, projection, and
self-justification.

For some people, perhaps a significant minority, morals are complied with unwillingly
and only through the force of social pressure and fear of legal consequences. Such
people would never hire a thug to beat up an enemy or settle a score. But they are
all too happy to give their fealty to strongmen who promise to do this very same
thing to their enemies. It never occurs to such people that someone ruthless enough
to hurt their opponents is also ruthless enough to turn on their own supporters
should it one day prove convenient.

Among many people, there is a deep, unstated need to justify their own selfishness
and petty actions. Such people may have the belief that while morality is fine, it's also
just sentimental nonsense "for suckers,"
and that their own venality is a necessary part of the fabric of society,
gross but excusable, like sneezing or defecating. A society full of nice, kind,
moral people, is ineffective and unlivable, and the only way to "make things happen"
is to put an @sshole in charge who isn't afraid to mow down anyone in his way.
All the better so the rest of us can claim blamelessness.

Unfortunately, the track record of "make things happen" @ssholes is poor. For every Lee Kuan Yew
(the hard-assed authoritarian leader of Singapore who pushed his city-state to
the forefront of modernization), there are dozens upon dozens of incompetent populists
and tin-horn dictators throughout every continent,
sociopaths that made impossible promises to
a subset of the country's population, claiming all they needed to do to fix everything was
"break a few rules" and "do what needs to be done." Only to raid the treasury, leave the
country to ruin and die in office, leaving their heirs to fight over the pieces.
There's a reason defenders of authoritarianism always give the example of Singapore
as a success - because they have nothing else to point to.

The pop-culture variant of this is the made-relatable-for-movies mafiosi - always
conniving and cunning, yet loyal to a fault to their family and church. "They get things
done and family always comes first," say the defenders of this movie lifestyle, who
usually fancy themselves to be the same sort of people, as if the need to provide
for one's family is an excuse for any variety of bad behaviors. A read through the personal
history of actual mob families will disabuse any reader of some notion of
mafia as flawed-but-loyal family paragons.
Such people treatied their families no better than they treated anyone
else, and had no loyalty except to themselves.

Is there a Baha'i angle to this? Of course there is.

> Truthfulness is the foundation of all the virtues of the world of humanity. 
> Without truthfulness, progress and success in all of the worlds of God are 
> impossible for a soul.
>           (Abdu'l-Baha, Baha'i World Faith - Abdu'l-Baha Section, p. 384)

One thing that all these people have in common - the politicians, lovers and
business partners whom we find horrible to others and wonderful to us - is an inability to
tell the truth. People who live by deceitfulness are not going to establish a
"deceit-free zone" with their closest loved ones and supporters. Why should they?
Their character has been warped by their facility with the art of deceit. The
foundation is bad. While Baha'is don't believe anyone is beyond salvation,
such people are usually much easier to avoid than fix.
And anyone who enters into allegience with such people hoping to benefit
from their wrongdoing usually find themselves on the receiving end of poetic justice.

Remember this when someone claims to be "fighting dirty for you." No one will ever
be _your_ @sshole. It's not a matter of 
if he (or she, but probably a he) will turn on you, but when.
