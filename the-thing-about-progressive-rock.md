#The Right Kind of Uncool (or, About Progressive Rock)

Progressive rock is in the news again.

Well sort of. In as much as you see the occasional headline on rock
anymore, which is infrequent, and on the near-comotose genre of
progressive rock.

The source of the hubub is David Weigel's new book ["The Show That
Never Ends: The Rise and Fall of Prog
Rock"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393242250/). This is the sort of
book that used to show up, unnanounced and unloved, in the Barnes and
Noble's book section, or perhaps in the waiting room of your son's
guitar teacher. However, this particular book has garnered much more press than
the usual labor of love destined for marginal sales. David Weigel is a well-known political writer, and excerpts
from his book have appeared years ago in a [multipart series of
articles in
Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/prog_spring/features/2012/prog_rock/history_of_prog_the_nice_emerson_lake_palmer_and_other_bands_of_the_1970s_.html)
and recently in [the Daily
Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/take-a-cruise-with-musics-uncoolest-people). Similar
headlines were made when [Yes' 2017 induction into in the Rock & Roll
Hall of Fame](https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/yes), something that
fans of years before had thought unlikely and critics thought ludicrous.

However, what inspired me to write this was something of a far more
gassy nature: a rock book describing an indie-rock
band in terms so pretensious and pompous as to make any prog rock fan
blush. Apparently someone thought [the Strokes (remember them) were
the center of the music universe in
2001-2002](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2017/06/lizzy_goodman_s_meet_me_in_the_bathroom_reviewed.html). Yet
I'm sure the writer would have hated progressive rock. You see, rock
critics *hate* progressive rock. For reasons I never quite knew, but
that the existence of this, um, _specimen_ of a book has helped me to
see why exactly rock critics turned on progressive rock.

Presently in 2017, questions about about progressive rock always
center around why people continue to listen to this music. The (almost
entirely) male fan base seems to be a handul of easily-mocked baby
boomer obsessives, interested in only hearing repeats of LPs from
forty years ago. Looking at the present, one wonders what was so great about
them in the past. What was it that caused a movement so fierce that
the backlash continues to this day? What is it about these acts that
is said to be so horrible?  And if these acts, which are generally
regarded as extemely musical competent, are horrible, why are other
genres like teen pop, death metal and other musics which distinctly
repellent to ousiders generally exempt from this sort of ridicule?

Because I'm a disorganized sort of person and because people like
numbered lists for some reason, here's a numbered list of things
people get wrong or misremember:

1. There wasn't a 'prog rock' at the time. Some might have called it
'art rock,' a term that was also applied to a lot of other ambitious
but musically unrelated acts. Also, some acts such as Pink Floyd
weren't even considered 'prog' at the type, but was lumped in with
other long-forgotten genres; in this case, the long-forgotten 'space
rock' genre, a meaningless term unless you're also one of the 10
remaining living beings that remember Hawkwind.  remember space
rock. Additionally, well-regarded seventies acts like David Bowie, Eno
and Frank Zappa have never been labeled as "Prog" in spite of catering
to nearly-identical fan bases.

2. Reading about the reaction to prog, you would think that these were
THE big acts of the seventies chart-toppers, whose sales competed with
the likes of Led Zeppelin and the Rolling stones. Some were big
(particulary the live acts), but aside from Yes and ELP, their album
sales certainly put them into "cult act" status - perhaps better than
a run-of-the mill hard rock band, but nothing like the big acts like
Led Zeppelin and Rolling Stones. Additionally, radio play, which was
always limited, became even moreso as FM stations professionalized and
stopped letting their DJs play 10-minute epics.

3. Rock critics were generally quite favorable towards the more
accomplished acts, particularly during the early seventies, when the
strongest albums came out. Albums like King Crimson's
"In the Court of the Crimson King" and "Red," Yes' "Close to the
Edge," and Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of The Moon" had no trouble
breaking into critic's top 10 charts at the time.

Given the facts as I report them above, why the severe backlash? Why
this particular musical movement, and not several other equally
successful subgenres of the seventies?

True, the movement didn't exactly wear its popularity well. The
movement was particularly beloved by affluent teens and the fan base
was overwhelmingly male. Some of the bands, ELP in particular, had
rather obnoxious opinions about about rock music in general. A loud
subset of their fans were particularly clutish and snotty. Finally,
the rise of punk coincided with a wholesale across-the-board
decline in the quality of the releases by bands like Yes, Genesis and
ELP. From the years 1977 on, one reason it was hard to find a positive review of
a progressive rock band was because most of them just weren't worth a
positive review.

But there was something else that was going on. The problem laid not
with the music itself, but with the critics themselves - the people
who earned a living writing about rock music.

You see, rock music critics do not really write about music. If you
read a review, you will see they are much more inclined to write
_around_ the music. Most music journalists haven't a lick of musical
training - certainly not enough to talk about music itself with any
precision. So you get an excessive focus on lyrics, which some bands
will freely admit are put in as an afterthought, combined with lots of
lifestyle critique.  As was succinctly described as Frank Zappa, rock
critics were: "writers who can't write talking to people who can't
talk for readers who can't read."

Probably the ultimate ur-critic of
all of this is Lester Bangs, who famously hated progressive rock from
the beginning, right when his fellow critics were praising it.
Part of it is people's taste - some people just like their music more
straightforward, don't like competing melody lines and complicated
arrangements. But the more you read about it, the more you realize:
prog rock - and more serious music in general - just isn't very much
fun to write about. Journalists need a story; Lester Bangs knew how to
tell a good story; and prog rock _itself_ wasn't giving a good
story. And outside of the music, you were left with the scene - a
crowd of geeky males absent women which was just about The Worst Place
in the World To Get Laid. And the musicians, who are so serious about
their work that it makes it seem like _a job_. Who wants that?

Back to that book about the Strokes. Whatever you think of the band
(and I though they were just ohKAY), obviously they were a lot of fun
to write about, enough to merit an entire goddam book about the early
naughtie's music scene in the Lower East side as if it was a
fully-develped scene spawning dozens of great acts. In fact, I can
tell you the actual truth is the EXACT opposite. I lived there at the
time. If you dig up some old Village Voice column, you'll in fact see
plenty handwringing about why doesn't have New York have a vibrant
original scene like Seattle. In fact, other than The Strokes and The
National, the musical acts at the time hardly registered - known for
being able to build a big buzz locally but never able to break outside
the New York scene. So did such an enemic scene justify this tome?

Acts like The Strokes had to become big - because they were so much
fun to write about. These guys were Living The Rock And Roll
Dream. You can fill up a book with something like that. And THAT, my
friends, is what the rock music writers are looking for - not musical
values.

Meanwhile, nobody was worse to write about then Prog artists. Many bands,
such as Yes, were already in their thirties by the time they formed,
and the technical demands of the craft kept most of them too busy and
away from drugs and exciting parties with groupies. It didn't get any
fun until the mid-seventies, with the bizarre excesses that began
festooning the scene in the mid-seventies - bizarre spectacles like
Liztomania and Rick Wakeman's King Author's Court on ice. Given such
performances,  combined with a drop-off in quality from new records,
the fact that every big act in Britain in the mid-seventies seemed to
be going "proggy" and the fact that rock journalism became a
burgeoning industry fed by writers who tended to ignore the whole "music"
part of the equation, by the late seventies, the Lester Bangs school
was ascendant, and it became all schadefreude all the time.

Of course, none of this actually speaks to why people listen and why
the music has fans. And okay, _I get it_, there are valid reasons not
to like this stuff. The Beatles and Stevie Wonder were capable of
doing amazing, innovative music without losing the public in the
process, while groups like King Crimson seemed to take a perverse
delight imposing music of bewildering complexity on the hapless
listener. But the reason The Beatles remain adulated is because it's
friggin' hard to do. To fans of progressive rock, it's better to come
close to that peak and fail than it is to never try, and better to create interesting music than something that doens't push the ball forward.

But the point remains: a lot of prog was bad. SERIOUSLY bad. Let's
take apart the discography of one band who was not afraid to be
labeled as proggy and pretentious: Emerson Lake and Palmer. Let's go
through the prog rock checklist:
* Dismissive of ordinary rock and roll: check
* Ludicrous stage getup: check
* Over-the-top Libierace-style virtuoso displays: check
* Corporate logo appearing on all merchandise: check
* Name worthy of of a legal firm: check
* You secretly suspect all the band members hate each other: check

Their discography is a mess. ELP has one acknowledged masterpiece:
_Brain Salad Surgery_. They have two others that are legitimately
good, but not up to that high bar: _Trilogy_ and their epynomous debut. Another
one, _Tarkus_ is their own _Tales of Topographic Oceans" - beloved by
hardcore neckbeareded fans, and hated by everyone else. And
a number of other mediocre recordings that bear no hint of the
brilliance of their best work.

Such discographies are of prog acts; Yes released three great albums
over the span of less than three years, and had just a handful of
albums that approached them over a career covering *decades*. There
are perhaps a handful of albums that are truly great, a bunch more that are
very good... and a lot that just didn't wear that well. 

There is,
however, considerable agreement on what is *the best*.
Here are The Great Ones in no particular order, grouped by
artists. Note the years - almost all of this was early 1970s. I'm
picking those that are known nowadays as prog rock, those where both
the fans and the critics would agree "This is Prog". 

King Crimson:
_The Court of the Crimson King_ (1969)
_Red_ (1974)
_Discipline_ (1981)

Yes:
_Fragile_ (1971)
_Close to the Edge_ (1972)

Genesis:
_Selling England by the Pound_ (1973)

ELP:
_Brain Salad Surgery_ (1973)

Pink Floyd:
_The Dark Side of The Moon_ (1974)
_The Wall_ (1979)

Rush:
_Moving Pictures_ (1981)

and that, unfortunately, is it. I'm tempted to throw in Soft Machine's
_Third_ (1971), which should rightly be considered a great _jazz
fusion_ album, and Kate Bush's _The Kick Inside_ (1978), just to
clarify that the woman was just as prog as the rest. But that would be
it. The rest are good but not great - and yes, that means ELO, the
Moody Blues, Kansas, Camel, etc.. The near misses like Kansas and
Camel, and the pop-oriented prog like ELO and Moody Blues, never
reached this peak. Much as I hate to say it, A Ramones album is just
way more fun than a prog acts that never do better than mediocre
(*coughcoughStyxcoughcoughcough*).

Is prog dead? Well, if you
scanned the best-of lists of the 2000s and 2010s, you would find a
shocking number of experimental, prog-like groups. Aside from the
normal post-rock suspects, you'd find quite a few - Sigur Ros,
Porcupine Tree, Tool and The Mars Volta - that are indistinguishible
from the prog aesthetic. Not to mention the whole post-Rock movement,
which started even earlier and continues with acts like Explosions in
the Sky. If anything, the first decated of the new
millenia produced more prog-like music in indie rock and metal than
the seventies did.

Yet none of these followers and imitators would ever be mistaken for
the "classic" prog of Yes, King Crimson and Genesis.  This definition
of "prog" as a movement barely extending for 10 years is perhaps as it
should be. Musically-challenging artists are always going to be with
us. But it is quite unusual for a genre to spontaneously arise
dedicated to its promulgation. It happened twice in jazz - first, with
be-bop in the 1940s, then with free jazz in the 1960s. In both cases,
the movements were lambasted as being too hard to follow, too
uncommercial; both were credited with "killing jazz"; both were said
to serve self-important musicians more interested in "art" than in
entertaining crowds. And both have come to be recognized as critics as
two of the most important innovations in jazz - essential movements
within the field responsible for pushing the genre out
over-commercialization and artistic dead ends - yammerings of Wynton
Marsalis and Stanley Crouch notwithstanding.

The fact that critics still bellyache do not keep todays newest
musicians from looking back at prog antecedents - no matter how much
they violate the holy trinity of "blues-based guitar music of simple
song forms." Indeed, the whole britpop and indie rock movements
dedicated to the canonization of this song form were mainly
responsible for producing a plethora of nearly identical sounding
bands. This was to such an extent that The Guardian dubbed the entire
genera "Indie Landfill," based on the ridiculous oversupply of
interchangeable competent-but-uninspired guitar-based rock bands. Were
they trying to be the next Oasis, the next Strokes, or the next Arctic
Monkeys? Unfortunately, it hardly matters. All you need is an album
full of AABAs songs, 4 chords and a dream. Credit this
in the favor of bands like Yes and Soft Machine:
they set the bar so ridiculously high that we were never threathened
with "prog landfill"; fans would rather spin _Fragile_ one more time
than give a chance to a band whose only credential was being able to
get their hands on a Mellotron. If that means being incredibly picky
with new music, then hey, it's my ears.
